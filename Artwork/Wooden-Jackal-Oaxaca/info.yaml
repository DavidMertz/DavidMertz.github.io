  § Based on the image, this artwork is a hand-carved and painted wooden
  sculpture of a skeletal creature. It is likely an alebrije figure.

  § A bipedal, skeletal figure with a long, dog-like or jackal-like head and
  prominent ears. The figure stands on two long legs, with feet that have
  defined toes, giving them a clawed appearance. Its body is depicted as a rib
  cage, and its arms are articulated and extend to a three-fingered hand. A
  thin, stick-like tail extends from its lower back. The head is large in
  proportion to the body, with a wide, open mouth revealing a red or pink
  interior and prominent white teeth. The ears are large, pointed, and have
  intricate black line work.

  § This piece, with its skeletal and fantastical features, is likely an
  Oaxacan alebrije or a related form of Mexican folk art, often inspired by
  mythological creatures, dreams, and the themes of the Day of the Dead (Día de
  Muertos). Its playful and macabre design is a hallmark of this artistic
  tradition.
