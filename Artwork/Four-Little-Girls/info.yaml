  § The central figure is a representation of Uncle Sam, but with a somber and
  aged appearance. He is shown from the waist up, with a stern, gaunt face and
  a long, white, pointed beard. His signature top hat is tilted, and he is
  holding it in his left hand, partially obscuring his face. The hat is
  decorated with the American flag's stars and stripes.

  § Instead of his usual patriotic suit, his shirt is a dark, patterned garment
  that serves as the canvas for the main message of the piece. On his chest,
  there are four portraits of four young girls, arranged in two rows.

  § Above the top two portraits are the names "CAROLE" and "ADDIE MAE." Below
  the bottom two portraits are the names "DENISE" and "CYNTHIA." The area
  around the portraits is filled with intricate, dark, floral or filigree-like
  patterns. Below the portraits, a bird, possibly a dove or a similar fowl, is
  visible.

  § The artwork has a very detailed, crosshatching or stipple-like style,
  suggesting it was created using pen and ink, etching, or a similar drawing
  technique. The coloring is subtle, with the face and beard rendered in shades
  of gray, while the shirt and hat have hints of blue, red, and brown. The
  overall tone is serious and memorial.

  § The artwork is a powerful and poignant commentary. The four girls depicted
  are Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, and Cynthia Wesley,
  who were victims of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham,
  Alabama, on September 15, 1963. The use of Uncle Sam, a personification of
  the United States, as the bearer of this tribute suggests a statement about
  the nation's responsibility or role in the tragedy and a memorialization of
  the victims. The somber expression and the placement of the girls' portraits
  on his heart or torso transform the patriotic symbol into a figure of
  national mourning and reflection on a dark chapter of American history.
