  § Based on the images, this artwork is a hand-carved and painted wooden
  sculpture of a fantastical dog-like creature. This style is characteristic of
  Mexican folk art, specifically the alebrijes from Oaxaca.

  § Subject: A creature resembling a dog, seated with its front legs forward
  and back legs tucked beneath its body. Its head is raised and its mouth is
  open in a wide, stylized grin, revealing jagged white teeth and a bright pink
  interior.

  § Material: The sculpture is made of carved wood, which is a key feature of
  Oaxacan alebrijes. The surfaces appear smooth, but the carving lines are
  visible, giving it a rustic, handmade feel.

  § "SMT OCOTIAN.OAXA" - This likely stands for "San Marcos Tlapazola, Ocotlán,
  Oaxaca." San Marcos Tlapazola is a known artisan village in the Ocotlán
  Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, famous for its red clay pottery, but also home to
  skilled woodcarvers. The abbreviation "OAXA" confirms the origin as Oaxaca.
