  ยง Deity Depiction: The mask clearly represents Ganesha, the Hindu deity with
  the head of an elephant. Key features include the prominent trunk, large
  ears, and the overall elephantine face.

  ยง Artistic Style: The style is very similar to traditional Sri Lankan folk art,
  particularly the masks used in a variety of performances and rituals. The use
  of carved wood, vibrant colors (red, gold, and black are common), and the
  specific rendering of the features are consistent with Sri Lankan
  craftsmanship.
  
  ยง Cultural Significance: Ganesha masks are an integral part of Sri Lankan
  culture. They are used in traditional dance forms, such as the Kolam dance,
  which is a folk play where performers wear masks to depict various
  characters. Ganesha is revered in both Sri Lanka and India as the remover of
  obstacles and the god of new beginnings, making him a popular subject for
  such masks.

  ยง Decorative Elements: The small, reflective pieces (possibly mica or small
  pieces of mirror) embedded in the forehead and headdress are a common
  decorative element in many South Asian and particularly Sri Lankan crafts.
