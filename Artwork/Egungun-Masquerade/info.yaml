  ยง Based on the style of the sculpture, it appears to be a representation of
  an Egungun masquerade figure. Egungun is a tradition among the Yoruba people,
  primarily in Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. These masquerades are performed to
  honor ancestors and are a significant part of their spiritual and cultural
  practices.

  ยง The figure in the image has a mask-like headpiece and a costume made of
  layered fabric and raffia or yarn, which is characteristic of Egungun attire.
  The staff it holds and the overall posture also align with the appearance of
  Egungun masqueraders.
