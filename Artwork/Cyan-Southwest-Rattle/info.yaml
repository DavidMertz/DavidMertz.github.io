  ยง Based on the images provided, this artwork appears to be a double-sided
  rattle or ceremonial object, likely made from a gourd. Here is a detailed
  description:

  ยง A cluster of feathers, possibly an eagle or hawk feather, hangs from the
  bottom twine. The feathers are a grayish-brown color with lighter, fluffier
  bits near the quill.

  ยง The style of the artwork, particularly the use of gourds, feathers, and
  specific geometric and symbolic motifs, is suggestive of Native American
  craftsmanship, possibly from the Southwestern United States, such as Pueblo
  or Navajo cultures. The symbols, like the sun-like motif and the four-pointed
  cross, are common in various Indigenous traditions and often hold spiritual
  or ceremonial significance.
