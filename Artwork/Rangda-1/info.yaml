  ยง Based on the image, the artwork appears to be a large, intricate mask of a
  Balinese mythological figure, likely Rangda.

  ยง The Beard/Hair: A long, flowing mane of what looks like black horsehair or
  similar material extends from the mask, reaching down to the bottom of the
  frame. This dramatic element contributes to the imposing and otherworldly
  presence of the figure.

  ยง The Medallion: A central, ornate sash hangs down from the mouth. It's
  adorned with round, reflective medallions that are framed by a dark, possibly
  velvet, fabric with a red and gold pattern. The Fabric: A black and white
  checkered cloth is draped over the central sash. This pattern, known as
  poleng, is a significant symbol in Balinese culture, representing the duality
  of good and evil.

  ยง The overall appearance strongly suggests a depiction of Rangda, the demon
  queen of the Leyaks in Balinese mythology, who is often portrayed in
  traditional dance dramas as a powerful and fearsome figure representing the
  destructive forces of nature. The craftsmanship appears to be a combination
  of carving, painting, and textile work, and it's likely a decorative piece or
  a prop used in cultural performances. Now
