        <h2>Accuracy</h2>
        <p>In a classification model, there are numerous <em>metrics</em> that might express the "goodness" of a model.
            Accuracy is often the default metric used, and is simply the number of right answers divided by the number
            of
            data points. For example, consider this hypothetical <em>confusion matrix</em>:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Predict/Actual</th>
                    <th>Human</th>
                    <th>Octopus</th>
                    <th>Penguin</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Human</td>
                    <td><strong>5</strong></td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Octopus</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td><strong>3</strong></td>
                    <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Penguin</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td><strong>11</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>There are 28 observations of organisms, and 19 were classified accurately, hence the accuracy is
            approximately
            68%. Other commonly used metrics are precision, recall, and F1 score.</p>

        <h2>Big Data</h2>
        <p>The concept of "big data" is one that shifts with time, as computing and storage capabilities increase.
            Generally, big data is simply data that is too large to handle using "traditional" and simple tools. What
            tools
            are traditional or simple, in turn, varies with organization, project, and over time. As s rough guideline,
            data
            that can fit inside the memory on a single available server or workstation is "small data," or at most
            "medium-sized data."</p>
        <p>As of 2021, a reasonably powerful single system might have 256 GiB, so big data is at least tens or hundreds
            of
            gigabytes ($10^9$) in size. Within a few years of this writing, the threshhold for big data will be at least
            terabytes ($10^{12}$), and already today some data sets reach into exabytes ($10^{18}$).</p>

            a byte) is stored in the last position.</p>

        <h2>Curse of dimensionality</h2>
        <p>The phrase "curse of dimensionality" was coined by Richard E. Bellman in 1957. It applies to a number of
            different numeric or scientific fields. In relation to machine learning, in particular, the problem is that
            as
            the number of dimensions increases, the size of the parameter space they occupy increases even faster. Even
            very
            large data sets will occupy only a tiny portion of that parameter space defined by the dimensions. Models
            are
            fairly uniformly poor at predicting or characterizing regions of parameter space where they have few or no
            observations to train on.</p>
        <p>A very rough rule of thumb is that you wish to have fewer than ⅒ as many dimensions/features as you do
            observations. However, even very large data sets perform best if feature engineering, dimensionality
            reduction,
            and/or feature selection can be used to reduce their parameter space to hundreds of dimensions (i.e. not
            thousands, often tens are better than hundreds).</p>
        <p>However, as a flip side of the curse of dimensionality, we also sometimes see a "blessing of dimensionality."
            Linear models especially can perform very poorly with only a few dimensions to work with. The very same
            types of
            models can become very good if it is possible to obtain or construct additional (synthetic) features.
            Generally,
            this blessing occurs when models move from, e.g. 5 to 10 features, not when they move from 100 to 200
            features.

        <ul>

            <li>Each column has data items of the same data type.</li>
            <li>Data may be selected by indicating collections of rows and collections of columns.</li>

        <h2>Domain-specific knowledge</h2>
        <p>Much of data science, including even that part of it concerning this book topic, cleaning data, can be driven
            by
            "the shape of the data itself." Certain data items may follow patterns or stand out as anamolous on a purely
            numeric or analytic basis. However, in many cases, accurate judgements about which data is important, or
            which
            is of greater importance, lies not in the data themselves but in knowledge we have about the domains the
            data
            describe.</p>
        <p>Domain-specific knowledge—or just "domain knowledge"—is what informs us of those distinctions that the data
            alone
            cannot reveal. Not all domain knowledge is extremely technical, the term might refer to topics that are more
            "common sense" as well. For example, it is general knowledge that outdoor temperatures in the northern
            hemisphere are usually higher in July than in January. A data set that conflicted with this background
            knowledge
            would be suspicious even if the individual data values were all, in themselves, in a reasonable numeric
            range.
            Bringing that very common domain knowledge to a problem is important, where applicable.</p>
        <p>Equally, some domain knowledge requires deep subject-area expertise. Data in a psychological survey might
            show
            particular population distributions of subscales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
            (MMPI).
            Some distributions might be implausible and indicate likely data integrity or sample bias problems, but a
            specialized knowledge is needed to judge that. Or radio astronomy data might show particular emission
            frequency
            bands from distant objects. A specialized knowledge is needed to determine whether that is consistent with
            expectations of Hubble red-shift distances or might be data errors. Likewise in many domains.</p>

        <h2>Endianness</h2>
        <p>Endianness in computer representations of numbers is typically either <strong>big-endian</strong> or
            <strong>little-endian</strong>. This refers to the scaled magnitude of composite values stored in a
            particular
            order. Most typically, the composite values are bytes, and they are arranged into "words" of 16-bits,
            32-bits,
            64-bits, or 128-bits (i.e. 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes per word).
        </p>
        <p>For example, suppose we wish to store an (unsigned) integer value in a contiguous 32-bit word. Computer
            systems
            and filesystems typically have an addressing resolution of one byte, not of individual bits directly, so
            this is
            4 such slots in which scaled values may be stored. For example, we wish to store the number 1,908,477,236.
        </p>
        <p>First, we can notice that since each byte stores values 0-255, this is a reasonable way to describe that
            number:
        </p>
        $$1,908,477,236 = (52 \times 2^0) + (13 \times 2^8) + (193 \times 2^{16}) + (113 \times 2^{24})$$<p>Storing
            values
            in each of the 4 bytes in the word could use either of these approaches:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Byte-order</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>Little-endian</td>

        <p>Historically, most CPUs used only one of big-endian and little-endian word representation, but most modern
            CPUs
            offer switchable <em>bi-endianess</em>. Likewise, many libraries such as <em>NumPy</em> allow flexibility in
            reading and writing data of different endianness in storage format.</p>
        <p>Formats other than computer words used to store numeric values may also be endian. Notably, different date
            formats can be big-endian, little-endian, or indeed <em>middle-endian</em>. For example, ISO-8601 date
            format
            prescribes the big-endianness, e.g. <code>2020-10-31</code>. The year represents the largest magnitude,
            month
            next largest, and day number the smallest resolution of a date. The extension to time components is similar.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, a common United States date format can read, e.g. <code>October 31, 2020</code>. A spelled out
            month
            name indirectly represents a number here (numbers are also used with the same endianness and different
            delimiter, e.g. <code>10/31/2020</code>). From an endianness perspective, this is middle-endian. The largest
            magnitude (year) is placed at the end, the next largest magnitude (month) at the start, and the smallest
            magnitude (day) in the middle. Clearly, a <em>different</em> middle-endian format is also possible, but is
            not
            widely used (e.g. <code>2020 31 Oct</code>).</p>
        <p>Much of the world outside of the United States uses a little-endian date representation, such as
            <code>31/10/2020</code>. While the specific values in the representation of October 31 would disambiguate
            the
            endianness used, for dates such as October 11 or November 10, this is not the case.

        <p>Metric prefixes are standardized in the International System of Units (SI), by the International Bureau of
            Weights and Measures (BIPM). Orders of magnitude—powers of 10—are indicated by prefixes ranging from
            <em>yotta-</em> ($10^{24}$) down to <em>yocto-</em> ($10^{-24}$). In partcular, the multipliers of $10^3$
            (<em>kilo-</em>), $10^6$ (<em>mega-</em>), and $10^9$ (<em>giga-</em>) are <em>almost</em> right for dealing
            with typical quantities seen in computer storage.
        </p>
        <p>However, for both historical and practical reasons, bytes of memory or storage are typically expressed as
            multiples of $2^{10}$ (1024) rather than of $10^3$ (1000). These numbers are relatively close, but while it
            is
            common to misname $2^{10}$, $2^{20}$, and $2^{30}$ as <em>kilobyte</em>, <em>megabyte</em>, and
            <em>gigabyte</em>, these are wrong. Since 1998, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has
            standardized the use of <em>kibibyte</em> (GiB), <em>mebibyte</em> (MiB), <em>gibibyte</em> (GiB) for
            accurate
            description of these powers of 2. For larger sizes, we also have <em>tebibyte</em> (TiB), <em>pebibyte</em>

        <p>A popular book, <u>The Grammar of Graphics (Statistics and Computing)</u>, by Leland Wilkinson (ISBN:
            978-0387245447), first published in 2000, introduced a way of thinking about graphs and data visualizations
            that
            breaks down a graph into components that can be expressed independently. Changing one such orthogonal
            component
            may change the entire appearance of a graph, but will still reflect the same underlying data in a different
            manner.</p>
        <p>The R library <code>ggplot2</code> attempts to translate the concepts of that book into concrete APIs, and
            has

        <h2>Halting problem</h2>
        <p>The halting problem is probably the most famous result in the theory of computation. Alan Turing proved in
            1936
            that there cannot exist any general purpose algorithm that answers the question "Will this program ever
            terminate?" For some programs it is provable, of course, but in the general case it is not. Even running a
            program for any finite amount of time, N steps, does not answer the question, since it might yet terminate
            at
            step N+1.</p>
        <p>In slightly more informal parlance, saying that a given task is "equivalent to the halting problem" is an
            idiomatic way of saying that it cannot be solved. At times the phrase is used as a speculation about the
            difficulty of a problem, but at other times a mathematical proof is known that shows that solving the novel
            problem would imply a solution to the halting problem. Within this book, the phrase is used only in the
            strict
            sense, but with an affection for the jargon of computer science.</p>

        <p>The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) is an open source file format that supports large, complex, heterogeneous

            The
            "leaf" of a hierarchy is a dataset. An HDF5 file may contain arbitrary and domain-specific metadata about
            each
            <em>dataset</em> or <em>group</em>. Since many HDF5 files contain (vastly) more data than will fit in
            computer

        <h2>NOIR (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)</h2>
        <p>The acronym NOIR is sometimes used as a mnemonic for different feature types. This is the French word for
            "black"
            but is especially associated, in English, with a style of "dark" literature or film. The acronym stands for
            Nominal / Ordinal / Interval / Ratio.</p>
        <p><em>Nominal</em> or <em>ordinal</em> variables simply record which of a finite number of possible labels a
            data
            item records. This is sometimes called the <em>classes</em> of the variable.</p>
        <p><em>Ordinal</em> variables express a scale from low to high in the data values, but the spacing in the data
            may
            have little to no relationship to the underlying phenomenon. For example, perhaps a foot race records the
            first
            place, second place, third place, etc. winners, but not the times taken by each. 1st place crossed the line
            before 2nd place; but we have no information on whether it was milliseconds sooner or hours sooner. Likewise
            between 2nd and 3rd position, which might differ significantly from the first gap.</p>
        <p>The last variable types are <em>continuous</em> variables, but <em>interval</em> and <em>ratio</em> variables
            are
            importantly different. The difference is in whether there is a "natural zero" in the data. The domain zero
            need
            not always be numeric zero, but commonly it is. Acidity or alkalinity measured on pH scale has a natural
            zero of
            7, and generally values between 0 and 14 (although those are not sharp physical limits). If we used pH
            measure
            as a feature, we might re-center to numeric zero to express actual ratios (albeit, log ratios for this
            measure).
            It is reasonable to treated pH as a ratio variable.</p>
        <p>As an example of an interval that is not a ratio, a newspaper article claimed that the temperature on a
            certain
            winter day, in some city, was <em>twice</em> as hot as in average years based on an artifact of the
            Fahrenheit
            scale in which a difference was between 25℉ and 50℉. This is nonsense as a ratio. It is perfectly useful to
            talk
            about the <em>mean temperature</em> or the <em>standard deviation</em> in temperature, but the numeric ratio
            is
            meaningless (in Celsius or Fahrenheit; in Kelvin or Rankine its minimally meaningful, but rarely used to
            describe temperatures in the range that occur on the surface of the earth). In contrast, the <em>ratio
                variable</em> of rainfall has a natural zero which is also numeric zero. Zero inches (or centimeters) of
            rain means there was none. 2 inches of rain is twice as much water falling as 1 inch of rain is.</p>

        <h2>Ontology</h2>
        <p>Ontology in philosophy is the study of "what there is." In data science an ontology describes not only what
            class/subclass and class/instance relationship exist among entities, but also the kinds of features an
            entity
            has. Perhaps most importantly, an ontology can describe the kinds of relationships that can exist among
            various
            entities.</p>
        <p>When different kinds of observations can be made, describing the particular collection of features that
            pertain
            to that observation, and the particular data types and ranges of permissible values each can take on, is an
            element of the ontology of the data. Different tables, or data subsets, may have different features sets and
            hence a different ontological role.</p>
        <p>Ontology can be important for categorical data especially. Some labels may be instances of other labels, for
            example with varying degrees of specificity. If one categorical variable indicates the entity is "mammal",
            another that it is "feline", and another that it is "house cat" those are all possibly descriptions of the
            identical entity under different taxonomic levels, and hence part of the ontology of the domain.</p>
        <p>The relationships among entities can sometimes be derived from the data themselves, but often requires domain
            knowledge. These relationships can often inform the kinds of models or statistical analysis that make sense.
            For
            example, if the <em>entity</em> underlying a collection of data is a medical patient, parts of the ontology
            of
            the domain might concern whether several different features observed were collected with the same
            instrument, or
            from the same blood sample, or whether the observations were made on the same day. Even though the features
            might measure very different quanties, the relationships "same-day" or "same-instrument" can inform
            analysis.

        <h2>Orthonormal basis</h2>
        <p>Within a highly dimensional space, specifically a parameter space, the location of an observation point is
            simply
            a parameterized sum of each of the dimensions. For example, if we measure 3 features in an observation as
            having
            values $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can express those measurements in 3-D <strong>parameter space</strong>, with
            orthogonal unit vectors $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$, and $\vec{z}$ as:</p>
        $$ observation = a\vec{x} + b\vec{y} + c\vec{z} $$<p>However, the choice to represent the observation using
            those
            particular unit vectors $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$, and $\vec{z}$ is somewhat arbitrary. As long as we choose any
            orthonormal basis—that is, N mutually perpendicular unit vectors—we can equally well represent all the
            relationships among observations. For example:</p>
        $$ a\vec{x} + b\vec{y} + c\vec{z} = a′\vec{x′} + b′\vec{y′} + c′\vec{z′} $$<p>Decompositions are a means of
            selecting an alternate orthonormal basis that distributes the data within the parameter space in a more
            useful
            way. Usually this means in a way concentrating variance within the initial <em>components</em> (lowest

        <h2>Parameter space</h2>
        <p>The parameter space of a set of observations with N features is simply an N-dimensional space in which each
            observation occupies a single point. By default, the vector bases that define the location of a point
            correspond
            directly with the features themselves. For example, in analyzing weather data we might define "temperature"
            as
            the X-axis, "humidity" as the Y-axis, and "barametric pressure" as the Z-axis. Some portion of that 3-D
            space
            has points within it, and they form some pattern or shape that models might analyze and make predictions
            about.
        </p>
        <p>Under decompositions of the features, we might choose a new <strong>orthonormal basis</strong> in which to
            represent the same data points in a rotated or mirrored N-dimensional space.</p>

        <h2>Query planner</h2>
        <p>When a query is formulated against a database, whether using SQL or another querying language, the database

            Many
            DBMSs can expose these plans prior to executing them; users can use this information to judge the efficiency
            of
            database access (and possibly modify queries or refactor the databases themselves).</p>
        <p>A query planner will make decisions about which indices to use, in what order, the style of search and
            comparisons across data that may live in many tables or documents, and other aspects of how a query may be

            hold
            the sign (negative or positive) of an integer. The largest integer that can be represented, for N bits
            storing a
            number, is $2^{N-1}-1$. The smallest integer that can be represented is $-2^{N-1}$</p>
        <p>Sizes of integers in many programming languages match sizes of memory units in modern CPUs, and can be 8-bit,
            16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit. Other bit lengths are rarely defined. In data formats and databases,
            sizes
            might be defined by a number of decimal digits rather than binary bits. Some programming languages like
            Python,
            TCL, and Mathematica in their default integers, and numerous other programming languages using specific
            libraries, allow for arbitrary-precision integers that have no size bound. They do this by dynamically

        <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <p>Taxonomy is, in some sense, a special aspect of ontology, it describes the hierarchical relationships among
            categories of entities. Some labels may be instances of other labels, for example with varying degrees of
            specificity. If one categorical variable indicates the entity is "mammal", another that it is "feline", and
            another that it is "house cat" those are all possibly descriptions of the identical entity under different
            taxonomic levels, and hence part of the ontology of the domain.</p>
        <p>While taxonomy is largely narrower than ontology, taxonomy also tends to indicate a focus on the more global
            level of the domain, not a narrow region of that domain. When one speaks of a taxonomy, it generally
            indicates
            an interest in all the relationships among all the classes of entities, and an expectation that those
            relationships will be tree-like and hierarchical. One might describe <em>ontological</em> features of a
            single
            entity, or a small collection of entities, but a taxonomy will normally describe the entire domain of all
            possible entities.</p>

                forces
