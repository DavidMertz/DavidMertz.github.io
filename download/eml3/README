Making sense of W3C Schemas

  In a prior review of XML editors, I looked at an early version of
  oXygen. I continue to be more-and-more impressed with this editor,
  each time a new version comes out, or even when I merely dig around
  for new features. Specifically, oXygen 4.2 includes a wonderful tool
  to create a friendly HTML documentation page for an W3C XML Schema.
  Included with this page is an automatically generated valid XML
  Instance. Contrast reading a schema directly, such as:

    http://gnosis.cx/download/eml3/410-ballots.xsd

  with reading oXygen's generated documentation, such as:

    http://gnosis.cx/download/eml3/Ballots.html.

  The homepage for the multi-platform XML editor oXygen is:
