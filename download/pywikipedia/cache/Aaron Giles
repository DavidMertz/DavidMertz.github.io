'''Aaron Giles''' is an American [[software engineer]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[software emulation]] pioneer.  Giles graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1992.

He is a <!-- how big of one? "huge" is unverifiable & unencyclopedic --> contributor to the [[MAME]] project, and currently, he is the lead maintainer of the MAME Project. Giles initiated and was the lead programmer for [[Connectix]] [[Virtual Game Station]], a commercial [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] emulator for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]].  This project was an impressive feat because the software could emulate the PlayStation's 33 [[Hertz|MHz]] [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] processor at full speed on only a 266MHz host computer.<ref name="history">http://aarongiles.com/history/index.html</ref>  Virtual Game Station's performance on modest computing resources surpassed any other emulator available at the time; the popularity of Virtual Game Station eventually led [[Sony]] to file a lawsuit against Connectix.  After a ruling in Connectix's favor, Sony bought all rights to Virtual Game Station to prevent its further sale and development.

Giles was hired by [[Microsoft]] in 2003 upon the Connectix purchase.
