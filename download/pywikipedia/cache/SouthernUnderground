'''''SouthernUnderground''''' is the [[sophomore album]] from American rap duo [[Cunninlynguists]], released in 2003. As well as resident vocalist Deacon The Villain and DJ-cum-vocalist Kno, the group employed Mr. SOS to accompany on vocals for much of the album. In addition to these three, many artists from the [[QN5]] record label are featured on the songs, most notably [[Tonedeff]] and [[Cashmere The PROfessional]].

It is best known for its underground smash hit "Seasons" with [[Masta Ace]] that details that history of hip hop comparing different eras to seasons of a year.  It also has many political songs like "Dying Nation" and "War".

It also contains the song "Falling Down" which is a based on (and somewhat a parody of) the movie starring Michael Douglas who plays D-Fens, a man who has a break down and makes his way home in a very violent manner.
