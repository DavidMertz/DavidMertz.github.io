'''''Until I Find You''''' is a [[2005]] [[novel]] by [[John Irving]] about a [[Canadian]] actor named Jack Burns. Sprawling across Canada, a large part of Europe and the United States, ''Until I Find You'' uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author.  The first half of the narration follows a young Jack Burns through his youth as he travels with his mother in search of his father through the subculture of tatoo artists. Like the title character in''[[The World According to Garp]]'' and Irving himself, Jack finds a talent for wrestling and an extended family that aids and hinders him through his trials as a young man coming of age, including his sexual awakening and abuse as an adolescent.  The second half of the narrative sees Jack on a road to discovering the truth behind the misconceptions that his younger self had thought he understood.

==review==

Complexity and great refinement makes [[John Irving]]'s eleventh and longest novel a true achievement as a literary course expanding since 1968 and always growing into a better emotional and stylistic and moral machine. Alongside authors like [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Paul Auster]], [[John Irving]] can be considered a major literary influence over the media world, like [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] or [[Gustave Flaubert]] or [[Francis Scott Fitzgerald]] or [[Mark Twain]] had been, an influence of a literary and philosophic dimension, very open and translatable.

The biographical tone remembering [[Charles Dickens]]'s David Copperfield deepens into auto analysis and general knowledge, sometimes learned, sometimes trivial and even media related and auto referential. American society is finely described trough the education, the life styles, the cultures, the aspirations and the experiences of the characters. Also present are well known vision and description of european northern countries; the life of the famous and cool; religious feelings; erotica; transcendent situations; the absurd; deconstruction of the novel; storytelling.

The three principal characters are Jack, the son growing into an actor; William, the absent father, a very much tattooed church organist; Alice, the mother, a tattoo artist by family tradition. The characters are all marked for life, not inevitably by tattoos but also and mostly by other sentimental signifiers that grasp the memory, and even by words, actions and signs that are omitted, almost forgotten.
