'''Charles Brackett''' ([[November 26]], [[1892]]-[[March 9]], [[1969]]) was an accomplished movie screenwriter and movie producer.

Brackett, who once studied at [[Harvard University]] and was a drama critic for [[The New Yorker]] at one time, was president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] from [[1949]] through [[1955]].
