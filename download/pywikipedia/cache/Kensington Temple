'''Kensington Temple''' is a large [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Church]] in the [[Notting Hill]] area of [[London]]. It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye, and is the largest church in its denomination, the [[Elim Pentecostal Church]].

==History==

The church was founded in [[1965]] by the [[Elim Pentecostal Church]] minister Reverend Eldin Corsie in Horbury Chapel, originally by the Hornton Street [[Congregationalism|Congregational]] Church in [[1849]]. The building had been used for some years by the [[Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship]] (itself an Elim offshoot founded by [[George Jeffreys]]) until its use reverted to Elim in the early [[1960s]] and it became known as Kensington Temple.

Under the ministry of Rev. Corsie in the late 1960s&ndash;[[1970s]] the congregation grew to 600, and then to several thousand under Rev. Wynne Lewis (later to become Elim's General Superintendent) during the 1980s. 

In 2005 the church moved its offices from their large ex-[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] warehouse (called "The Tabernacle") to Summit House, [[Hanger Lane]], [[London]]. Congregations continue to grow as do peripheral services. <ref>[http://www.kt.org/?p=kt_story KT Website]</ref>

==KT today==

The church continues to hold services at the Notting Hill site. There are five services on Sunday, with a live link service at the [[Notting Hill Coronet]] acting as an overflow for the busy 11am service. <ref>http://www.kt.org/?p=service_times</ref>. Among its many ministries, the church has a Bible School, a performing arts school <ref>http://www.kt.org/?p=about_excel</ref>, an A-level college <ref>http://www.kt.org/?p=ktioe_alevels</ref>, a nursery <ref>http://www.hillnursery.co.uk/</ref>, a conference centre <ref>http://www.annancourt.co.uk/</ref>, rooms to let, a publishing company (Dovewell Communications) <ref>http://www.kt.org/?p=dovewell</ref> and a cinema.<ref>[http://www.mynottinghill.co.uk/nottinghilltv/arts-coronet.htm Coronet Cinema, Notting Hill]</ref>

The church attracts such high-profile [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] preachers as [[Tommy Tenney]], [[Rodney Howard-Browne]] and [[Benny Hinn]].

==Theology & ministry==

The church is prominent in the [[Revivalism|revival]] of Charismatic Christianity initially known as the "[[Toronto Blessing]]". Colin Dye has become one of its foremost [[Apologetics|apologists]] in the UK, defending such phenomena as being [[Slain in the Spirit|"slain in the Spirit"]] and "[[holy laughter]]".<ref>Colin Dye, ''Revival Phenomena'' (Sovereign World, 1996)</ref>
