A '''safe''' is a secure [[Lock (device)|lockable]] box used for securing valuable objects against [[theft]] or damage.  A safe is usually a hollow [[cuboid]] or cylinder, with one face removable  or [[hinge]]d to form a [[door]].  The body and door are usually [[casting|cast]] from a [[metal]] such as [[steel]].

Specifications for safes include some or all of the following parameters:
*Burglar-resistance
*Fire-resistance
*Environmental resistance (e.g. to water or dust)
*Type of lock (e.g. [[Combination lock|combination]], key, [[time lock]], [[electronic lock]]ing)
*Location (e.g. wall safe, floor safe)
*Smart Safes as part of an [[Automated Cash Handling]] system

In 1835, Charles and Jeremiah Chubb took out their first patent for a burglar-resisting safe, although it is possible that safes were made by the firm before this date as the company [[Chubb Locks|Chubb Safes]] began designing safes and locks in 1818.

Opening a safe without access to the [[Key (lock)|key]] or knowledge of the combination is known as [[safe-cracking]]. This is a popular theme in [[heist film]]s.

A diversion safe or hidden safe is a safe that is made from an otherwise ordinary object such as a book, a candle, a can, or even a wall outlet plug. Valuables are placed in these hidden safes, which are themselves placed inconspicuously (for example, a book would be placed on a book shelf).

Fire resistant Record Protection Equipment consists of self-contained devices that incorporate insulated bodies, doors, drawers or lids, or nonrated multidrawer devices housing individually rated containers that contain one or more inner compartments for storage of records. These devices are intended to provide protection to one or more types of records as evidenced by the assigned Class rating or ratings; Class 350 for paper, Class 150 for magnetic computer tapes and photographic film and Class 125 for flexible disks.

These types of enclosures can be rated for periods of 1/2, 1, 2 and 4 hour durations.

In addition, these enclosures may be rated for their impact resistance.

Burglary resistant safes are rated as to their resistance to the type of tools to be used in their attack and also the duration of the attack.

The attack durations are for periods of 15 min., 30 min. and 60 min.

Safes can also contain hardware that automatically dispenses cash or validates bills as part of a [[Automated Cash Handling]] system.  A number of companies offer safes with automated cash handling, including [[Alpha CMS (Cash Management Solutions)]] and [[De La Rue]].
