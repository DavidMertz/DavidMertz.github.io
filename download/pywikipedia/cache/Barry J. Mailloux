'''Barry James Mailloux''' (d. [[May 26]] [[1982]]) obtained his [[MSc]] in [[Numerical Analysis]] in [[1963]].
From [[1966]] he studied at Amsterdam's [[National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science|Mathematisch Centrum]] under [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]].

He was one of the editors of the original ''Report on the Algorithmic Language [[ALGOL 68]]'' and a contributing editor to the ''Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language [[ALGOL 68]]''.

In [[1968]] he returned to the [[University of Alberta]] as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Science. His work on ALGOL 68 put the University of Alberta on the map as a center for ALGOL 68-related activity.

Barry's two students [[Chris Thomson]] and [[Colin Broughton]] established the [[Chion Corporation]], which produced [[FLACC]] (Full Language Algol 68 Checkout Compiler).
