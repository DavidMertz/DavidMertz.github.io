The '''riq''' (also spelled '''riqq''' or '''rik''') is a type of [[tambourine]] used as a traditional instrument in [[Arab music|Arabic music]].  It is an important instrument in both folk and classical music throughout the Arabic-speaking world.  It traditionally has a wooden frame (although in the modern era it may also be made of metal), jingles, and a thin, translucent head made of fish skin (or, more recently, a synthetic material).  Although in the West the tambourine is generally considered to be a simple rhythm instrument suited for unskilled performers, ''riq'' players are capable of great subtlety and virtuosity.
