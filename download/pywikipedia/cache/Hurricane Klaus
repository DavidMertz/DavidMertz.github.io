'''Hurricane Klaus''' was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] hurricane that formed in  October of the [[1990 Atlantic hurricane season]]. As a [[tropical cyclone]], it developed from a tropical wave and moved through the [[Lesser Antilles]]. After causing torrential flooding in [[Martinique]], it weakened before dissipating over the [[Bahamas]]. In Martinique, the storm killed 6 people and left 1,500 homeless. Damage estimates or totals are unavailable.

A portion of Klaus's circulation developed '''Tropical Storm Marco'''. Marco, when combined with the remnants of Klaus and a stationary cold front, produced torrential rainfall over the southeastern [[United States]]. The system dropped up to 12 inches of rain in some locations, resulting in 12 deaths and $150&nbsp;million (1990&nbsp;USD, $231&nbsp;million 2005&nbsp;USD) in damage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Klaus 1990 track.png}}
A tropical wave that exited the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 27]] moved across the tropical Atlantic without developing. While upper level shear was unfavorable, the wave was able to develop gradually, and became Tropical Depression Thirteen on [[October 3]] while not far east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It drifted north-northwestward and became a [[tropical storm]] later that day.<ref name="klaus">[ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/pub/storm_archives/atlantic/prelimat/atl1990/klaus/ Klaus Report]</ref>

Though upper level winds were unfavorable and most of the convection was to the northeast, Klaus was able to continue to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on [[October 5]], only 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) east of [[Barbuda]]. The lopsided system moved north of the islands without causing any wind damage or high amounts of rain. Shortly after, Klaus attained its peak intensity of 80&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (130&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) and a minimum central pressure of 985&nbsp;[[mbar]] ([[hPa]]).<ref name="klaus"/>

The tropical cyclone finally gave into the upper level shear and weakened, first to a tropical storm on the 6th, then a tropical depression on the 8th. Conditions became slightly more favorable for development over the [[Bahamas]], and Klaus briefly regained tropical storm strength on the 9th, but a developing low pressure system over [[Cuba]] that ultimately became [[1990 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Marco|Marco]] caused Klaus to dissipate late on the 9th. The remnants continued to the northwest, and combined with Marco and a cold front over the southeastern United States.<ref name="klaus"/>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

===Tropical Storm Marco===
[[Image:Tropical Storm Marco (1990).JPG|thumb|right|Marco at peak intensity|150px]]{{storm path|Marco 1990 track.png}}
A mid-level low pressure system developed along Klaus's large windfield, and organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen on [[October 9]] over central [[Cuba]]. It moved northwestward into the favorable western Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into a tropical storm on the 10th.<ref name="marco">[ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/pub/storm_archives/atlantic/prelimat/atl1990/marco/ Marco Report]</ref>

Marco passed through the [[Florida Keys]], and while paralleling the west coast of [[Florida]] it reached a peak of 65 mph.<ref name="marco"/>

It weakened to a tropical depression just before making landfall near [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]] on the 12th, though because much of its circulation was over land it was counted as a direct hit. Marco weakened as it turned to the northeast, and after becoming extratropical later on the 12th, and merged with a cold front over the southeastern United Sates on the 13th.<ref name="marco"/><div style="clear: both"></div>

==Impact==
Hurricane Klaus produced severe flooding in Martinique, killing 6.  The remnants of Hurricane Klaus combined with Tropical Storm Marco produced extensive flooding across the southeastern [[United States]], causing over $150 million in damage (1990 USD) and 12 more deaths.<ref name="damage">[http://www.augustaga.gov/departments/planning_zoning/docs/DraftHazardMitigationPlan08052005.pdf Damage Total]</ref>

===Martinique, Leeward Islands, and Bahamas===
Klaus struck [[Martinique]] as a tropical storm, causing extensive flooding. In all, 6 people died and 1,500 people were displaced as a result of the flooding.<ref name="Martinique flood">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DD163DF935A35753C1A966958260 NY Times "Tropical Storm Klaus Kills 6"]</ref><ref name="Flood archive">[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~floods/Archives/1990sum.htm 1990 Flood Archive]</ref> Because upper-level shear forced much of the hurricane's convection to its northeast, most of the other [[Leeward Islands]] reported little damage from Klaus. Rainfall totals were light, amounting to a maximum of 1.7&nbsp;[[inches]] (43&nbsp;[[mm]]) on [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]. In addition, though Klaus was producing winds of up to 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), the highest recorded wind gust was only 33&nbsp;mph (53&nbsp;km/h) on [[St. Croix]], contributing to the low damage total and a death toll of zero.<ref name="leeward">http://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sercc/projects/SERCCreport1.pdf</ref>

Klaus dropped 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Grand Turk]] in the [[Bahamas]], though no damage was reported from the storm.<ref name="klaus"/>

===Florida===
While paralleling the west coast of [[Florida]], Tropical Storm Marco brought up to 6&nbsp;inches (150&nbsp;mm) of rain to the state. In addition, four tornadoes were reported. Throughout the state, only minor wind damage was reported.<ref name="Florida">[http://www.pinellascounty.org/emergency/HVA-1.HTM Florida Effects]</ref>

On the east coast, Hurricane Klaus produced 15&nbsp;foot (4.5&nbsp;m) waves and tides being 3&nbsp;feet (1&nbsp;m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along the east coast as well, due to persistent westerly winds.<ref name="Eastern">[http://www.sky-chaser.com/stlog.htm Eastern Florida Effects]</ref>

=== Rest of Southeast United States===
[[Image:Klaus Marco Rainfall Amounts.gif|right|160px|thumb|Rainfall totals]]
When Klaus and Marco combined with a stationary cold front, they produced torrential rainfall across [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]]. The maximum total from the system was 19.89&nbsp;inches (50.53&nbsp;mm) in [[Louisville, Georgia]], with 14 other locations reporting amounts surpassing 10&nbsp;inches (25&nbsp;mm).<ref name="marco"/> 11 out of 15 of South Carolina's major river basins exceeded flood stage, and some areas surpassed the 50-100 year expected rainfall amounts. The system produced tornadic activity, one of which destroyed 25 homes in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].<ref name="Georgia">[http://www.savannahnow.com/features/flood/historic.html Savannah Georgia]</ref>

Unlike [[Hurricane Hugo]] a year before, Klaus and Marco's prolonged heavy rainfall caused 17 dams to fail across South Carolina, with an additional 31 dams overtopped with water. One such dam burst in Georgia, killing 4 people who were trapped in a car during the flooding.<ref>http://sc.water.usgs.gov/publications/pdfs/SC_Science_Plan.pdf</ref> A toddler drowned from the flooding in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg County]].<ref name="toddler">[http://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/severe.html 5 deaths]</ref>

In South Carolina, 80 bridges were destroyed in the flooding, with another 40 damaged or closed. Numerous secondary roads were washed out, and one flooded railroad track in [[Calhoun County, South Carolina]] caused a train to derail.<ref name="damage"/>

While rain was extreme, it was desperately needed, as much of the southeastern United States was under a heavy drought. <ref name="drought">[http://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/sc_climate.html Drought of 1990]</ref>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
Primarily because of the damage in [[Martinique]], the name '''Klaus''' was retired in the spring of [[1991]] and will never be used for an [[Atlantic hurricane]] again. It was replaced with '''Kyle''' in the [[1996 Atlantic hurricane season]], which wasn't retired and was used again in the [[2002 Atlantic hurricane season]] and is on the list of names in the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season]].
