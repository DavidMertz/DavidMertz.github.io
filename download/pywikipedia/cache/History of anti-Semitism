{{Anti-Semitism}}
This is a partial chronology of hostilities towards or discrimination against the [[Jew]]s as a religious or ethnic group. See '''main article [[Anti-Semitism]]''' for etymology, roots, traits and disputes on what is sometimes called "the longest hatred."[http://www.richardwebster.net/antisemitismthelongesthatred.html] 

Here we note significant events in the history of anti-Semitism: as well as important anti-Semitic actions, we also give events in the history of anti-Semitic thought, actions taken to combat or relieve the effects of anti-Semitism, and events that affected the prevalence of anti-Semitism in later years.

==Ancient animosity towards Jews==
;[[3rd century BCE]]: According to the 1st century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/works/files/apion-1.htm ''Against Apion''] Bk 1.14, 1.26), [[Manetho]], a [[Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] chronicler and priest, in his books on Egyptian history, alleges that [[Moses]] was not a Jew, but an Egyptian renegade priest called [[Osarseph]], and portrays the [[Exodus]] as the expulsion of a [[leper]] colony.  Josephus argues that Manetho's claims are inconsistent.

;[[175 BCE]]-[[165 BCE]]: [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] sacks [[Jerusalem]], calls [[Judaism]] "inimical to humanity", prohibits ''[[brit milah]]'', confiscates copies of [[Torah]] and erects an altar to [[Zeus]] in the [[Second Temple]] after plundering it. (See also [[Maccabees]], [[Hanukkah]])

;[[2nd century BCE]]: [[Mnaseas of Patros]], a [[Greek literature|Greek]] author, reports that the Jews worship a donkey's head in the [[Holy of Holies]]. This legend was repeated by [[Apollonius Molon]], [[Democritus]], [[Apion]] (cited by Josephus in [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/works/files/apion-2.htm "Against Apion"] Bk 2.7), and [[Plutarch]], the latter indicating that Jews venerated donkeys ([http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter4.html#section39 ''Symposiacs''] Bk 4.5).

;[[19]]: Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]] expels Jews from Rome. [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] Tranquillus, in ''Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', Vol 3, Tiberius, Section 36, says that Tiberius "suppressed all foreign religions... .  He distributed the Jewish youths, under the pretence of military service, among the provinces noted for an unhealthy climate; and dismissed from the city all the rest of that nation as well as those who were proselytes to that religion [335], under pain of slavery for life, unless they complied."  [[Josephus]], in his ''Jewish Antiquities'' (18.3.5), likewise says that Tiberius "ordered all the Jews to be banished out of Rome," taking "four thousand men out of them, and sent them to the island Sardinia; but punished a greater number of them, who were unwilling to become soldiers, on account of keeping the laws of their forefathers. Thus were these Jews banished out of the city ..."  [[Cassius Dio]] writes about Tiberius, "As the Jews flocked to Rome in great numbers and were converting many of the natives to their ways, he banished most of them." (Roman History, 57.18.5a)

;[[37]]-[[41]]: Thousands of Jews killed by mobs in Alexandria (Egypt), as recounted by [[Philo of Alexandria]] in ''Flaccus''.

;[[50]]: Jews ordered by Roman Emperor [[Claudius]] "not to hold meetings", in the words of Cassius Dio (Roman History, 60.6.6).  Claudius later expelled Jews from Rome, according to both Suetonius ("Lives of the Twelve Caesars", Claudius, Section 25.4) and Acts 18:2.

;[[66]]-[[73]]: [[Great Jewish Revolt]] against the Romans is crushed by [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus Flavius]]. Titus refuses to accept a wreath of victory, as there is "no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God." ([[Philostratus]], ''Vita Apollonii''). The events of this period were recorded in detail by the Jewish-Roman historian [[Josephus]].  His record is largely sympathetic to the Roman view, and hence is considered a controversial source. Josephus describes the Jewish revolt as being led by "tyrants," to the detriment of the city, and of Titus as having "moderation" in his escalation of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]].

;[[1st century]]: Fabrications of [[Apion]] in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], including the first recorded [[blood libel]]. [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] writes anti-Jewish poetry. [[Josephus]] picks apart contemporary and old anti-Semitic myths in his work ''Against Apion''. ([http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/author?name=Josephus,%20Flavius e-text at Project Gutenberg])

;Late 1st&ndash;early 2nd century: [[Tacitus]] writes anti-Jewish polemic in his ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+5.1 book 5]). He reports on several old myths of ancient anti-Semitism (including that of the donkey's head in the Holy of Holies), but the key to his view that Jews "regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies" is his analysis of the extreme differences between [[monotheistic]] Judaism and the [[polytheism]] common throughout the Roman world. 

;[[115]]-[[117]]: Thousands of Jews are killed during civil unrest in Egypt, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica, as recounted by [[Dio Cassius]]' ''History of Rome'' (68.31), and [[Eusebius]]' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (4.2), and papyrii.

;c. [[119]]: [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]] bans [[circumcision]], making Judaism ''de facto'' illegal.

;c. [[132]]-[[135]]: Hadrian constructs a [[Paganism|pagan]] temple to Jupiter at the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], builds Aelia Capitolina among ruins of Jerusalem and crushes the [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]]. [[Judea]] is wiped off the map and renamed into [[Palestine]]; Jews are left [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]] and stateless. 

;[[167]]: Claimed to be the first recorded accusation of [[deicide]]. A sermon, attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]], titled ''[http://www.kerux.com/documents/KeruxV4N1A1.asp On the Passover]'' (''Peri Pascha''), blames the Jews for following King Herod and Caiaphas to execute [[Jesus]], despite their calling as God's people (57, 93).   Melito says, "you did not know, O Israel, that this one was the firstborn of God." (82)  Melito does not attribute particular blame to [[Pontius Pilate]], but only mentions that Pilate washed his hands of guilt (92).  Melito wrote this sermon in Greek, so does not use the Latin word for deicide, ''deicida''.  (According to the ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/resolveform?lang=Latin Latin Dictionary]'' of Charleton Lewis and Charles Short, the latin word ''deicidas'' is used by the 4th century, by Peter Chrystologus in his sermon #172.)  At a time when Christians were widely persecuted, Melitos speech was an appeal to Rome to spare Christians.

;[[1144]] March 20 (Passover): The first [[blood libel]] in which the Jews of [[Norwich]], England were accused of [[ritual murder]] after a Christian boy ([[William of Norwich]]) is found dead.  It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified their victim.  From this time forward, similar charges were levelled against Jews in all quarters of Europe.  The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood and satisfied their thirst at the expense of innocent Christian children.   In accordance with this logic, the season of such charges was typically in Spring around the time of Passover which approximately coincides with the time of Jesus' death.

[[Pope Innocent III]] also reiterated papal injunctions against forcible conversions, and added: "No Christian shall do the Jews any personal injury...or deprive them of their possessions...or disturb them during the celebration of their festivals...or extort money from them by threatening to exhume their dead."

;[[1235]]:  The Jews of Fulda, Germany were accused of [[ritual murder]].  To investigate the [[blood libel]], Emperor Frederick II held a special conference of Jewish converts to Christianity at which the converts were questioned about Jewish ritual practice.  Letters inviting prominent individuals to the conference still survive.  At the conference, the converts stated unequivocally that Jews do not harm Christian children or require blood for any rituals.  In 1236 the Emperor published these findings and in 1247 [[Pope Innocent IV]], the Emperor's enemy, also denounced accusations of the [[ritual murder]] of Christian children by Jews.  In 1272, the papal repudiation of the [[blood libel]] was repeated by [[Pope Gregory X]], who also ruled that thereafter any such testimony of a Christian against a Jew could not be accepted unless it is confirmed by another Jew.  Unfortunately, these proclamations from the highest sources were not effective in altering the beliefs of the Christian majority and the libels continued.  [Ben-Sasson, H.H., Editor;  (1969).

The report said it was Europe's "duty to remember the past by remaining vigilant and actively opposing any manifestations of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance... Anti-Semitism is not a phenomenon of the past and... the slogan 'never again' is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago."
