'''Transgenderism''' is a [[grassroots]] [[political movement]] seeking [[transgender]] rights and affirming transgender pride. For many in the transgender - or "trans" - movement, the label transgender encompasses not only [[transsexual]] and transgender people but also transvestites, [[drag queen]]s, [[drag king]]s, [[intersexed]] individuals, and anyone non-conventionally [[gender]]ed (i.e., anyone identifying or behaving in a manner that runs counter to expected [[Norm (sociology)|societal norms]] concerning the gender assigned them after birth). 

Transgenderism is also occasionally used as a general label for people with [[gender identity disorder]], as in the ''[[International Journal of Transgenderism]]'' [http://www.symposion.com/ijt/index.htm].

Another, older and increasingly deprecated use sees transgenderism as explicitly different from "[[transsexualism]]".
