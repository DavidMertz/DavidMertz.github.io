==Topical blogs==
These are some areas of common interest in the [[Blogosphere|blogosphere]].

===Health===
Health blogs include personal accounts of living with injuries and diseases, and these accounts enable people with similar problems to share experiences. 

A category of health blogs is medical blogs, wherein health care professionals share medical news and work experiences. Medical blogs could prove useful by acting as early indicators of disease outbreaks and as sources of direction regarding off-label uses of prescription drugs. (When writing about patient cases, health care professionals must protect their patients' confidentially as mandated by [[HIPAA]].)

===Human Rights===
A few blogs write about the protection of human rights or the violations of these. The blog [http://udhr.blogspot.com Human Right Issues] operates from out of the Netherlands.

===Literature===
Given the obvious focus on words, it is not surprising that the [[Grub Street]] tradition has continued on the internet with daily commentary emanating from literary blogs (or [[litblog]]).  Many authors are also creating works of [[blog fiction]].

===Travel===
Famous explorers wrote their journeys down on paper. These days, modern travelers have used blogs as a way to share their stories and photos, even while they are traveling around the world.

===Research===
An increasing number of scholars and students blog their research notes, combining the traditional scholar's private notebook with public discussion. A related genre is the anonymous professor's blog, where the various issues related to academia may be freely discussed.

===Law===
Blogs by lawyers or law students, or which discuss law and legal affairs are often referred to as '''blawgs'''.  By extension, the creator of such a blog is a blawger, sometimes spelled blawgger (variant, rare). Some blawgs are narrow and deal with a focused and/or technical area of law, while others deal with whatever topic the blawgers wish to discuss.

===Religion===
Some blogs discuss religious topics. Religious blogs show the public's points of view on various topics in religion, politics, economics, and life in general.

===Media===
Some blogs serve as media watchdogs, reporting on falsehoods or inconsistencies that are presented as facts in the mass media. Many media blogs are focused exclusively on one newspaper or television network.

===Pets===
Some bloggers narrate their pets' experiences. An amusing technique is to allow the pets to "speak" in the [[Grammatical person|first person]].

===War===
A warblog is a blog devoted mostly or wholly to covering news events concerning an ongoing war. Sometimes the use of the term "warblog" implies that the blog concerned has a pro-war slant.

===Psychology and Psychiatry===
Psychology blogs report on the general field of psychology or discrete subgroups of psychology.  Examples of general psychology blogs include Dr. Grohol's [http://www.psychcentral.com/blog/ psychcentral] and the current news blog at [http://www.iqte.st/blog/ iqte.st].  [http://shrinkette.blogspot.com/ Shrinkette] publishes a psychiatrist's blog while Drs. Greta and David Munger publish [http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/ Cognitive Daily]
