'''Montes Taurus''' is a rugged, jumbled mountainous region on the [[Moon]]. These peaks are located on a highland region to the east of the [[Mare Serenitatis]], in the northeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. The [[selenographic coordinates]] of this range are 28.4° N, 41.1° E, and they have a diameter of 172 km. Some of the peaks within the range achieve heights of 3.0 km.

A number of craters lie embedded within this range. At the southwestern edge of the range is [[Römer (crater)|Römer crater]], and [[Newcomb (lunar crater)|Newcomb crater]] is located in the northeastern section. Several satellite craters also lie throughout the Montes Taurus.

The Montes Taurus were named by [[Johannes Hevelius]] for the [[Taurus Mountains]] in southern [[Turkey]].
