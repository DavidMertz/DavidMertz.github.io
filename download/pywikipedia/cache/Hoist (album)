'''''Hoist''''' is the seventh studio [[album]] by the [[jam band]] [[Phish]]. The album was the best selling [[Phish]] album at the time of its release. The album includes cameos from [[Alison Krauss]], [[BÃ©la Fleck]], and many other musicians as well as actor [[Jonathan Frakes]] on trombone. It contained a stripped down, simple song approach with pop friendly hooks, which was a brand new formula for [[Phish]].

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA 08/19/96.

There was an [[MTV]] video for "Down With Disease," directed by bassist [[Mike Gordon]].
