'''Karoline Geulen''' was a guard at the [[Buchenwald]] and [[Essen]] camps during [[World War II]].

Karoline Geulen was born on [[April 3]], [[1922]], in [[Germany]]. In 1944 she appeared on the guard roster at the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp as an [[Aufseherin]], and as an SS member.

Because she breached some camp regulations, [[Ilse Koch]] gave her the position of ''Strafkommandofuhrerin'' (Punishment Detail Leader).  

She was a ruthless guard who forced starving and weak women to carry heavy stones from one side of the camp to another. Later, Karoline was called to the Essen subcamp to function again as a ''Strafkommandofuhrerin''. 

She left the camp in April 1945 with the arrival of the [[United States|Americans]] and disappeared.
