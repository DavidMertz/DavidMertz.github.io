'''Football Club United of Manchester''' ('''FC United of Manchester''', '''FC United''' or '''FCUM''' for short) is a semi-professional [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club currently based in nearby [[Bury]].  The club was formed in 2005 by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] supporters, many of whom decided to withdraw their financial support for the club following [[Malcolm Glazer]]'s [[Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United|takeover]]. FCUM currently enjoy a healthy rivalry with [[Salford City]] and [[Maine Road F.C.|Maine Road]].

Although the majority of the club's support comes from [[Manchester]] and the surrounding area, its supporters club has branches in over ten countries including [[France]], [[Poland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States of America]] and [[Canada]]. The local cable television station [[Channel M]] began a monthly series of programmes about the club, the first of which was in January 2006. Television crews from [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] have been seen at the team's matches.

FC United's first season was very successful. FC United entered at the tenth level of the English football league system (the second division of the North West Counties Football League) and they were confirmed as champions on [[15 April]] [[2006]]. 

In the 2005-6 season, they had the second-highest average attendance anywhere in English [[non-League football]], only bettered by [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]].  The team is managed by the former [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] player [[Karl Marginson]] and their record attendance is 6,023 for a match against [[Great Harwood Town F.C.|Great Harwood Town]] on [[22 April]] [[2006]]. 

==History==
===Formation===
The club was founded in the summer of 2005 by disgruntled supporters of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].  Although those supporters had various reasons for their dissatisfaction with the club,<ref>{{cite web | title=United We Stand| work=Article on soccernet.com| url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=336636&cc=5739| accessdate=July 12 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> the prime catalyst for FC United's formation was the [[Malcolm Glazer takeover of Manchester United|hostile takeover of Manchester United]] by the [[United States]] businessman [[Malcolm Glazer]].  United supporters had previously considered forming a new club in response to a proposed takeover by [[Rupert Murdoch]] in 1998, but the takeover bid was unsuccessful so the idea was not implemented.  When it was announced that Glazer was considering taking over the club, the idea was brought up again as a possible "last resort" and discussed in Manchester United [[fanzine]]s including [[Red Issue]].

The Glazer family obtained overall control of Manchester United on [[12 May]] [[2005]], and supporters who had opposed the takeover organised a meeting at the Manchester Methodist Hall on [[19 May]].  Although the focus of the meeting was on continuing to oppose Manchester United's new owners rather than forming a new club, the meeting's chairman, Andy Walsh, announced that the formation of a new club would be discussed at a second meeting on [[30 May]] and that Kris Stewart, the then chairman of [[AFC Wimbledon]], had given much advice on setting up the club.<ref>The meeting took place at the Apollo Theatre, [[Manchester]].  AFC Wimbledon is another supporter-owned club that was established three years earlier.</ref>  It was decided that the club would be formed if 1,000 people pledged financial support by the end of July. This target was exceeded and the steering committee pushed ahead with plans for the club. 

A nearby club, [[Leigh RMI F.C.|Leigh RMI]], were in financial difficulties at the time and asked FC United to take them over, as the extra support from FC United would have ensured their club's survival.  The founders of FC United refused this proposition because they were creating the club in response to an unpopular takeover and didn't feel that taking over another existing club was appropriate.  The clubs remained on good terms, though, and FC United's first public match was a friendly against Leigh RMI.
The club's founders originally chose the name '''FC United''', but [[the Football Association]] rejected this as too generic. Those who had pledged money to the club were then asked to vote on a name from ''FC United of Manchester'', ''FC Manchester Central'', ''AFC Manchester 1878'' and ''Newton Heath United FC''.<ref>Manchester United was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 and the latter two names represented claims to this heritage (Manchester Central was one of the three choices in 1902 for the new name for Newton Heath, along with Manchester Celtic and Manchester United).</ref> On [[14 June]], [[2005]] it was announced that '''FC United of Manchester''' had been chosen with 44% of the vote.  FC United continues to be used as an abbreviated form of the club's name.  

[[Karl Marginson]] was appointed as manager on 22 June, and the club held trials for players on [[26 June]].  900 players applied to take part in the trials, of whom 200 were selected to do so and 17 were chosen to play for F.C. United, although most of those have since left the club.  By [[8 July]] [[2005]], over 4,000 people had pledged money to FC United and the club had over £100,000 in the bank.<ref>{{cite web | title=Article on ''Manchester Online''| url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/sport/football/manchesterunited/s/164/164927_mittens_family_affair.html| accessdate=July 8 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

FC United were admitted to the second division of the [[North West Counties Football League]], putting the club at level ten of the [[English football league system]], nine levels below the [[FA Premier League]].  The league had four spare places at the time, so no other club was denied promotion as a result of FC United's admission.  The club was formed after the deadline for entering the [[FA Vase]] had passed so they were not eligible to play in it in the 2005–06 season, although they were able to play in the North West Counties League Challenge Cup. They are eligible to enter the [[FA Vase]] in the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-2007]] season and the [[FA Cup]] the year after.  The club then arranged to play their 2005-06 home matches at [[Bury F.C.]]'s stadium, [[Gigg Lane]] where all home games (with the exception of one league fixture in February 2006 v Holker Old Boys which was played at Moss Lane, Altrincham), have been played since.

===2005-06 season===
[[Image:FC United banner.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A banner at an FC United match.  The text is a reference to a [[Stone Roses]] song.]]
:''Main Article [[FC United of Manchester Season 2005-06]]''
FC United's first public match was an away friendly fixture against [[Leigh RMI F.C.|Leigh RMI]] on [[16 July]] [[2005]].  The match ended 0&ndash;0.

FC United entered the North West Counties Division 2, and The League arranged for F.C. United's first league match to be away to the club with the biggest ground, [[Leek CSOB F.C.|Leek CSOB]], in order to gauge whether it would be possible for other clubs to host F.C. United at their own grounds. It took place on Saturday [[13 August]] [[2005]] and was the first all-ticket match in the history of the league.  The attendance of 2,590 set a new record for the NWCFL, and was higher than Leek CSOB's combined attendances for the whole of the previous season. F.C. United won the game 5&ndash;2.

After a successful season the NWCFL Division Two trophy was awarded at the home game v Great Harwood Town FC on Saturday [[22 April]] [[2006]], in front of a crowd of 6,023, a NWCFL record attendance.
<!-- I know this needs some work, and mention of the overall playing record for the season, but this is the kind of length we need to keep this part to -->

===2006-07 season===
FC United's first match in the North West Counties League Division One (Level 5 of the non-League Pyramid) was against St. Helens Town FC on Saturday [[12 August]] [[2006]], FC United winning 2-0.

The season so far has been an impressive one for FC United, with a strengthening squad and good off-field support.  They will hope for promotion from the division, but were eliminated from the [[FA Vase]] at the third round stage by [[Quorn F.C.|Quorn]].

==Organisation==
F.C. United is an [[industrial and provident society]].  Membership is obtained by donating one pound or more to the club, but each member receives only one share in the club and is entitled to a single vote at meetings, regardless of the amount donated.

The club has an elected board of twelve members, but has not yet chosen a chairman.  Tony Pritchard is acting as chairman until a decision is made.

The club has two full-time employee positions:  Andy Walsh as chief executive and Lindsey Robertson who has replaced Luc Zentar as club secretary. Both Andy Walsh and Luc Zentar were heavily involved in the club's formation.<ref>The club prefer to use the term General Manager instead of Chief Executive, but the term Chief Executive has to be used for legal reasons.  {{cite web | title=Chief Executive and Club Secretary Appointed| url=http://www.fc-utd.co.uk/news/story.php?story_id=203| accessdate=February 8 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

The club's manifesto includes the following core principles:<ref>{{cite web | title=The Manifesto: Who We Are and What We Mean| url=http://fc-utd.co.uk/mission/manifesto.php| accessdate=December 11 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>
# The Board will be democratically elected by its members.
# Decisions taken by the membership will be decided on a one member, one vote basis.
# The club will develop strong links with the local community and strive to be accessible to all, discriminating against none.
# The club will endeavour to make admission prices as affordable as possible, to as wide a constituency as possible.
# The club will encourage young, local participation - playing and supporting - whenever possible.
# The Board will strive wherever possible to avoid outright commercialism.
# The club will remain a non-profit organisation.

The club accepts sponsorship but does not allow sponsors' logos to be displayed on the team's shirts. The club's main sponsor in its inaugural 2005-6 season was the Bhopal Medical Appeal. Currently FC United's main sponsor is the Williams BMW Group.

== Future aspirations ==
In November 2006 at the club's Annual General Meeting, the club outlined bold aspirations for the forthcoming six years <ref>{{cite web | title=FC United 'two steps from the League in three years'| work=Article on www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/fcunited/s/227/227180_fc_united_two_steps_from_the_league_in_three_years.html| accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> 
including:
* winning promotion in three successive seasons to take them to [[Conference North]] by 2009.
* reaching an average of 5,000 supporters per home game by 2009.
* building their own 7,000 - 10,000 capacity stadium, as central to Greater Manchester as possible, by 2012.
