'''''Deathtrap Dungeon''''' is a medieval action/adventure [[video game]] released in [[1998]] for the [[PlayStation]] and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] formats, by [[Eidos Interactive|Eidos]]. It is an adaption of the fantasy [[role-playing]] game of the same name.

The game is a third-person adventure, set in a series of underground dungeons, where your choice of main character (either amazon Red Lotus or barbarian Chaindog) is an adventurer seeking [[treasure|riches]]. He or she may reach this goal by fighting through hordes of monsters and surviving the various [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] of said dungeon, after receiving an invitation to do so by the [[wizard]] who owns it.

The enemies include [[goblin]]s, [[human]] [[Fighter (character class)|fighters]] and [[dinosaur]]s, and the diversity and action in this section is hailed as one of few strong points in the game. On the downside, some of the [[puzzle]]s are considered more frustrating than challenging, and poor camera control - often resulting in the player succumbing to an enemy or a trap he or she could not detect - is another point considered by [[review]]ers to be a great drawback of the game.  

Although originally previewed for the gaming press alongside Eidos' own original Tomb Raider game, Deathtrap Dungeon sat through several years of delays before finally seeing release.  Unfortunately, the graphics had not improved with age, so the game still looked like a first generation PSone game at a time when third generation titles were hitting the market.  Critical and consumer reactions were muted at best {{fact}}.
