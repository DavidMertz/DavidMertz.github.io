==Life and career==
His early farce, ''A Little Change'', was produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1872. 

Grundy became well known as an adapter of plays. Among his earlier successes were ''The Snowball'' (1879), based on ''Oscar, ou le marl qui trompe sa femme'' by [[Eugène Scribe]] and Duvergne, ''In Honour Bound'' (1880), based on Scribe's ''tine Chaine'', and ''The Silver Shield'' (1885).  ''The Bells of Haslemere'', written with H. Pettitt, was a success in 1887. In 1889–1890 Grundy produced two original comedies, ''A White Lie'' and ''A Fool's Paradise'', which had been produced two years earlier as ''The Mouse-Trap''. 

Grundy's original [[libretto|libretti]] included the one-act "musical absurdity" ''Popsy Wopsy'' (1880), the full-length ''[[The Vicar of Bray]]'' (1882) and ''Pocahontas'' (1884), both with [[Edward Solomon]],  and ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' (1892), with [[Arthur Sullivan]]. 

Among Grundy's most successful adaptations were ''A Pair of Spectacles'' (1889) from ''Les Petits Oiseaux'' of Labiche and Delacour. Others were ''A Village Priest'' (1890) from ''Le Secret de la terreuse'' and a melodrama by Busnach and Cauvin. These were followed by ''Sowing the Wind'' (1893); ''An Old Jew'' (1894); an adaptation of [[Octave Feuillet]]'s ''Montjoye'', called ''A Bunch of Violets'' (1894); ''The New Woman'' (1894); ''The Slaves of the Ring'' (1894); and ''The Greatest of These'' (1895).

Later notable works included ''A Marriage of Convenience'' (1897) from ''Un Mariage de Louis XV'', by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], ''The Silver Key'' (1897) from his ''Mlle de Belle-isle'', and ''The Musqueteers'' (1899) from the same author's novel. These were followed by ''The Degenerates'' (1899); ''A Debt of Honour'' (1900); ''Frocks and Frills'' (1902) from ''Doigts de fees'' of Scribe and [[Ernest Legouvé]]; ''The Garden of Lies'' (1904) from [[Justus Miles Forman]]'s novel; ''Business is Business'' (1905), a rather free adaptation from [[Octave Mirbeau]]'s ''Les Affaires sont les affaires''; and ''The Diplomatists'' (1905) from ''La Poudre aux yeux'', by Labiche.
