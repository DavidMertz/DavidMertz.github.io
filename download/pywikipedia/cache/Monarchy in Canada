{{Politics of Canada}}
[[Canada]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]], a [[Commonwealth Realm]], and a [[dominion]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its reigning monarch, since February 6, 1952. As such she is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[head of state]], though she does hold several powers that are hers alone, while the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is sometimes referred to as the [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]]. <ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref> The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth II's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]].  The Prince of Wales undertakes various public ceremonial functions, as does the Queen's husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. There are several other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]] besides those aforementioned, including the Queen's other children and cousins.

In Canada, the Queen's official title in [[English language|English]] is: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].'' In [[French language|French]], the Queen's title is: ''Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi.'' In common practice, Queen Elizabeth II is referred to simply as "The Queen" or "The Queen of Canada" when in Canada, or when abroad and acting on the advice of her Canadian ministers.

==Constitutional monarchy in Canada==
===International vs. domestic role===
One of the most complicated features of the Canadian monarchy is that it is in fact a shared monarchy. Some 53 independent, sovereign states, including Canada, are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (formerly The [[British Empire]], and later British Commonwealth of Nations). 16 of these countries are specifically [[Commonwealth Realm]]s who recognize the same Queen, Elizabeth II, as their [[Head of state]]. Although, aside from being Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II is also separately Monarch of each of the other Commonwealth Realms, each nation &ndash; including Canada &ndash; is sovereign and independent of the others.

[[Image:Royal Standard of Canada.svg|left|thumb|225px|The [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag]].]]
[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], is the current monarch's conventional title for all her Commonwealth Realms, but is generally addressed as "Queen of Canada" when she is actually present in Canada or when she otherwise performs ceremonies relevant to Canada. Some examples are conferring [[Canadian honours]] while in the [[United Kingdom]] or participating in the [[Vimy Memorial|Canadian World War II Memorial]] Ceremonies in [[France]].

Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any monies to the Queen either for personal income or to support the Royal residences outside of Canada. Only when Queen Elizabeth II is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does any Canadian government support her in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]].

Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] triannually issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004. Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999 <ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34 million in 2002. <ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref> 
(See [http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf $1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005])

Usually the Queen's Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the [[Governor General]] and [[Lieutenant-Governor]]s in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.

Most of the Queen of Canada's domestic duties are performed by the [[Governor General of Canada]] at the federal level and [[lieutenant governor]]s at the provincial. There are few duties which must be performed specifically by the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] (e.g., signing the appointment papers of Governors General and Lieutenant), or require assent by the Queen as well as the Governor General, but on occasion the [[monarch]] must personally act directly in [[partisan (political)|partisan]] affairs. For example, this occurred when former [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Brian Mulroney]] advised [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to expand the number of [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] seats to assure passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]. The Queen followed his advice, and as [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], [[Brian Mulroney|Mr. Mulroney]] became [[Accountability|accountable]] for that [[advice]].

In addition to the Queen's role in each of her realms, the Canadian monarch is also the nominal [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Though this title, does not imply any political power over member nations, and does not automatically belong to the monarch, only the shared monarch of the Commonwealth Realms has ever held this [[Title of authority|title]].

===Constitutional role===
The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] provides the [[dominion]]s with the right to be considered equal to Britain rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were subordinate. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called British since this time (in both legal and common language) for historical, legal, and for reasons of convenience. 

The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]]. Under the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]], Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s and cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless Canada explicitly leaves the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. These concepts were reasserted by Justice Rouleau in a [[2003 in Canada|2003]] [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] (see below) in which he wrote that "Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle."

Canada's constitution is made up of a variety of Canadian as well as British statutes and conventions, which give Canada an almost identical system of government as the U.K. and other Commonwealth realms. As a result the identity of the sovereign is determined by the conditions set out in the British [[Act of Settlement]]. This legislation laid out the rules that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]] nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. This has led to a legal challenge (''see [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003|O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen]]''). Succession to the throne is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]] also governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement]] and the [[English Bill of Rights]]. These documents are now part of Canadian constitutional law. As Canada's rules of succession are identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]). 
(see [[Succession to the British Throne]] for more information.)

[[Image:GeorgeVIBanffSprings.jpg |right|thumb|250px|King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] talking with the Rt. Hon. [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].]]
As in the UK, the Monarch's role is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, and the powers that are constitutionally hers are exercised wholly upon the advice of the elected government. In exceptional circumstances, however, the Monarch or Governor General may act against such advice based upon her [[reserve power]]s &ndash; as when Governor General [[Baron Byng|Byng]] refused a demand by Prime Minister [[W.L. Mackenzie King]] for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections, because King's request was blatantly unconstitutional, and it is the first order of the Monarch to defend the constitution (see [[King-Byng Affair]]). For the most part, however, the monarch functions as a [[Rubberstamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] and a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments operate. It has been correctly said since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1714), the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France]]. 
(For more explanation of the Monarch's role, see [[Governor General of Canada]].)

All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada]] and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor]]s. On all matters of the Canadian State, the monarch is advised solely by the Canadian federal and provincial [[first minister]]s. Effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] no British government can advise the monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada. The Governor General is appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]]. The ten Lieutenant-Governors are appointed by the Governor General, in the name of the Monarch, upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada though the Monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives assent. It is also possible that if the Governor General decided to go against the Prime Minister's or the government's advice, the Prime Minister could appeal directly to the Monarch or even recommend that the Monarch dismiss the Governor General.
(See also [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]].) 

[[Royal Assent]] and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures. Assent is usually granted or withheld by the Governor or Lieutenant Governor. The Monarch's representative may reserve a bill for the Monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the Monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor-General (who may in turn defer to the Monarch). The Monarch has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the constitution). Recently activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament. However it received Royal Assent from the Queen's representative on July 19, 2005. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.

The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by Governor in Council at the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. But as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are ''not'' representatives of the sovereign. They receive instruction from the said [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|federal Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs]].

(For more information on the Monarch's constitutional role also see [[Royal Prerogative]]s)

===Cultural role===
[[Image:Victoriacrosscanadapostagestampimage.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross]] is the highest decoration in the [[Canadian honours system]]. It's motto "For Valour" was adopted on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].]]

Though [[Canadian Royal Family|Canada's Royal Family]] is not resident in Canada itself, the monarchy is a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians. The reigning monarch's image is traditionally printed on Canadian coins, some currency and postage stamps such as the [[Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp (Canada)|Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp]]. Portraits of the monarch are often found in government buildings, military installations, many schools, as well as Canada's high commissions and embassies abroad.

Images of St. Edward's, the Tudor, and King's Crown are also visible on police forces badges (see [[:Image:OPP_Logo.jpg|Ontario Provincial Police badge]]), military badges (see [[:Image:Canadian_Armed_Forces_Tri-service_badge.PNG|Canadian Armed Forces Tri-service badge]]), some provincial, even personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] (see [[Coat of Arms of Quebec]]), on [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canada's Royal Coat of Arms]], on various medals, and awards.

These lattter cases reflect the monarch's place as the ceremonial head of the [[Canadian honours system]]. As such, only she can approve the creation of an [[honour]], which she does as requested by government of Canada. Although, the Governor General administers most responsibilities relating to Canadian honours on the Queen's behalf.

At one time the monarchy was considered a British institution when most Canadians still continued to consider themselves British subjects. However as this changed and Canadian nationalism evolved so to did the cultural role of the monarch. The federal and provincial governments now recognise and promote the Queen's role as monarch of Canada as separate to her position as Queen of the United Kingdom. <ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref> <ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref> <ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm The Crown in Canada]</ref> As a result the cultural importance that Canadians attached to the monarchy as a British institution visibly declined, particularly, in the decades following World War II.

As Canada began to emerge and blossom into a mature nation in her own right formerly British symbols became symbols of the monarch, or loyalty there to. The [[Union Jack|Royal Union Flag]] remains an official flag in Canada, though a distinctly [[Canadian flag]] was adopted in 1964 as the National flag. ''God Save the Queen'' remains the [[royal anthem]] and forms part of the Canadian Royal Salute which is performed by playing the Royal Anthem, ''[[God Save the Queen]]'', then the National Anthem, ''[[O Canada]]''. The [[Vice Regal Salute|Vice-Regal Salutes]] also includes the first six bars of ''God Save the Queen'' which then modulate into the first four and last four bars of ''O Canada''. The Vice-Regal Salute is played only for the governor general and each lieutenant-governor, because they represent Canada's monarch.

Over time the monarch's separate role as Queen of Canada, resulted in other changes. One of these changes was to the monarch's titles. Although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]]/Défenseur de la Foi," neither the Queen, the governor general, nor any [[lieutenant-governor]] has any religious role in Canada. There have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]] in [[1867 in Canada|1867]]. This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in the United Kingdom where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. In a speech to the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in [[1953 in Canada|1953]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]] stated on this topic:
::"...The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith. In England there is an established church. In our countries [the other monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organisation is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler."

For over 200 years members of the Royal Family have visited or lived in Canada. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives abroad, members are still regular visitors to Canada, enough so that on occasion [[Royal visits to Canada]] are also referred to as Royal Homecomings. These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.

In Canada, [[Victoria Day]] has become the holiday for celebrating Canada's monarchy. Traditionally the monarch's birthday, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II April 21, is the day for honouring the reigning monarch. Since 1953, however, the official birthday of Canada's monarch has been [[Victoria Day]]. Originally the holiday was set by [[vice-regal]] proclamation on the first Monday before May 24 of every year, but in 1957 the date of the national holiday was permanently fixed by statute.

===Legal role===
[[Image:Canadian_Supreme_Court_justices_circa_1950.jpg|right|thumb|In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is displayed the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]].]]

In Canada the legal personality of the [[State]] is referred to as "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada", and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., "in Right of Ontario," etc.). For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government. For example a case, in which, a province sues the federal government, would formally be called ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Prince Edward Island v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada''. 
(See Also [[The Crown]])

Similarly the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|oath of allegiance]] to Canada, sworn by new [[citizenship|citizens]], the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], is an oath of allegiance to the monarch as sovereign of Canada, and to his/her heirs and successors according to law. The relationship between the Oath taker and the Monarch is a complex one with roots reaching back to historical periods when a monarch ruled and accepted an Oath of [[fealty]]. Modern Oaths are still [[reciprocal]] but now the Oath taker places their allegiance to the continuing State, its laws, etc., as embodied by the Monarch. As the legal personality of the [[State]], the Monarch has obligations to the Oath taker. The Monarch's acceptance of her responsibilities to her subjects is symbolised by the [[Coronation]] Oath, which is a renewal of the relationship between the Monarch and her subjects. 

In addition the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of Courts of Justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms, except in the province of [[British Columbia]] where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of its judiciary. <small>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp]</small>  [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms. Such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.

==The Crown and the First Nations==
[[Image:HM-tablet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Her Majesty the Queen of Canada presents a tablet of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] granite with the ciphers of both herself and her great-[[Grandparent|grandmother]] Queen Victoria, at the [[First Nations University of Canada]], May 17, 2005.]]

As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing government. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] made clear that the First Nations were autonomous political units and affirmed their title to lands. It remains an important document, mentioned in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], outlining the Canadian Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories and maintain the bilateral "nation-to-nation" relationship. <ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763,the Treaty of Niagra and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref> <ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref>

An early example of the Crown's protection of First Nations people was during the [[American Revolution]]. As a consequence of the [[Mohawk Nation]]'s allegiance with the British, through being a part of the [[Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy]], the Mohawk peoples were forced from their lands in the [[Mohawk Valley]], in present day [[New York State]], by the revolutionaries. As compensation, the British Crown promised land in Canada to those displaced by the war. In 1784 some Mohawks settled in what is now the [[Bay of Quinte]], where North America's only two Royal chapels, [[Christ Church Royal Chapel|Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]] and [[Mohawk Chapel|Her Majesty's Chapel of the Mohawks]], were built to symbolise the connection between the Mohawk peoples and the Crown.

To commemorate a diplomatic visit to [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] by the "[[Four Mohawk Kings]]", or the three Mohawk and one Mahicanin Chiefs of the Iroquoian Confederacy, in [[1710 in Canada|1710]], the [[Four Mohawk Kings|portraits]] of the "Four Indian Kings" were painted by Jan Verelst. After hanging in [[Kensington Palace]] for almost 270 years, Queen Elizabeth II donated them to the Canadian Collection at the [[Library and Archives Canada|National Archives of Canada]], unveiling them in Ottawa in 1977.

Also in 1984, as a bicentennial gift, Queen Elizabeth II gave the [[Christ Church Royal Chapel|Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks]] a new silver chalice to replace one lost during the American Revolution. The lost chalice was from a set given to the Mohawks by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1712 to embody the relationship between the Crown and Mohawk people. <ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref> 

Treaty No. 7 was signed by the [[Blackfoot]], [[Kainai Nation|Blood]], [[Northern Peigan|Peigan]], [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Sarcee]] and Stony Indian tribes in 1877, ceding the praries of Southern [[Alberta]] to what was then the British Crown.  In 1977 Prince Charles visited Alberta to attend celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing.

A modern demonstration of the relationship between the First Nations and the Crown was seen in 1994 when the [[Dene]] community of the [[Northwest Territories]] presented a list of grievances over stalled land claim negotiations to Queen Elizabeth II, rather than to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], while the two were attending an Aboriginal Cultural Festival in [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories]]. After speaking with the Chief, the Queen handed the list to the Prime Minister for the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] to address.

In May of 2005 the Queen, during a visit to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in [[Saskatchewan]], presented a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself. The gesture behind the gift was outlined in the Queen's words:

::"This stone was taken from the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the Highlands of Scotland - a place dear to my great great grandmother, Queen Victoria. It symbolises the foundation of the rights of First Nations peoples reflected in treaties signed with the Crown during her reign.

::"Bearing the cipher of Queen Victoria as well as my own, this stone is presented to the First Nations University of Canada in the hope that it will serve as a reminder of the special relationship between the Sovereign and all First Nations peoples." <ref>[http://edmonton.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View?filename=ed-first-nations-queen20050511 CBC: First Nations say they're left out of royal visit]</ref>

Nevertheless, First Nations groups complained that their role during the Queen's visit was a purely symbolic one, and were disappointed that neither the provincial nor federal governments granted them a private audience with the Queen to express concerns about treaty violations. {{fact}}

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==
[[Image:Wessex-dop2b.jpg|thumb|left|225px|HRH [[Sophie, The Countess of Wessex]], speaks with soldiers of the [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment|Lincoln and Welland Regiment]] as their [[Colonel-in-Chief]], June, 2005.]]
The Crown retains a prominent place within the [[Canadian Forces]]. The [[Constitution Act, 1867]] states that the [[Commander-in-Chief|Command-in-Chief]] of the Canadian Armed Forces is vested in the Queen. However, the 1905 ''Militia Act'' changed references to the Office of the Governor General to become the Office of the Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of the Militia; the title and its duties being held and performed by the Governor General on behalf of the Sovereign. The [[Letters Patent]] of 1947 further reinforce this position. <ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref>

The Sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by Canadian [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) (subsequently His Majesty's Canadian Ship during the reign of a king), and all members of the armed forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors.

In 1968 Defence Minister [[Paul Hellyer]], under the Government of [[Pierre Trudeau]], unified the [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] into the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], over the protests of many senior generals, admirals and air marshals. The "Royal" title was not bestowed upon the new unified service, though many of the former Army units retain the title and vessels are still titled "HMCS". Also, crowns are included in the vast majority of Canadian military insignia.

Members of the [[Canadian Royal Family]] have presided over many military ceremonies, including Trooping the Colours, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles. Whenever Her Majesty is in Ottawa she lays a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]]. As well, two other examples of Elizabeth II acting as Queen of Canada abroad were associated with the Canadian military; one in 1996 when she dedicated the Canadian War Memorial in [[Green Park]], [[London]], and the other in 2003 when she attended the Canadian 60th anniversary of [[D-Day]] ceremonies in [[Normandy]], [[France]].

Members of the Royal Family are [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments, including: le Régiment de la Chaudière; the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]]; le [[Royal 22e Régiment]]; the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]]; the [[The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa|Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa]]; the [[The Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Royal Newfoundland Regiment]]; and the [[Calgary Highlanders]], amongst many others. For a more comprehensive list see: [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage#Military|List of Canadian Organizations with royal patronage - Military]]

The Queen is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. <ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

==History==
===Kingdoms and Colonies===
Monarchy has been a concept in Canada since the first encounters between Europeans and indigenous North Americans. Europeans often considered vast tracts of land within in territories of different aboriginal groups to be Kingdoms. The leaders of these groups often referred to as Kings, particularly hereditary leaders.

[[Image:Louis15-1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Louis XV in 1748: The last King of France to rule in what is now Canada.]]
Since the establishment of [[New France]], Canada has been the territory of a monarchy or a monarchy in its own right. Kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534 to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1763), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain]] in 1713 to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1952), to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada today. 

During the period of colonization in North America, affairs of State were handled by representatives of monarchs, often called governors. Areas governed by British monarchs were primarily known as colonies, while New France ruled by French monarchs varied. At one time New France was a province of France ruled directly by its King.

Over time the role of the monarchs would change in Canada. Relations with aboriginals originally considered to be between European and North American monarchs changed to that between sovereign and subject. This would lead to the incorporation of treaties with the Crown into the political culture of Canada. The rule of various monarchs as well as their affairs in Europe would also affect the affairs of the European colonies in North America. Eventually almost all of the French posessions in what was known as Canada would be transferred from the French Crown to the British Crown, providing Canada with one singular monarchy.

[[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]] (later Edward, Duke of Kent), fourth son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], served in Canada on military duties and as Commander of British North American troops from 1791 until the turn of that century.  Almost twenty years later, Prince Edward's only daughter, Victoria, was born on May 24, 1819, at [[Kensington Palace]].  However, Edward died shortly thereafter, leaving Victoria heir to the throne; her three uncles ahead of her in succession, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Georve IV]], Frederick Duke of York, and William IV had no legitimate children who survived.

Upon the death King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who had, as Prince William, served in Canada and the West Indies as part of a naval contingent through 1786 to 1787, Victoria ascended as Queen at the age of 18.

In the early part of her reign, she was influenced by two men: her first British Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, and her husband, Prince Albert, whom she married in 1840. Both men taught her much about how to be a ruler in a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the monarch had very few powers but could use much influence.

Though she would never visit Canada, thanks to the spread of newspapers and the invention of photography, her image was reproduced sufficiently to increase her popularity even in her colonies.

[[Image:Royal_Family_In_1880.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The British Royal Family in 1880.]]
Her marriage to Prince Albert brought nine children between 1840 and 1857. Most of her children married into other Royal families of Europe. Some of her children and grandchildren would come to live at Rideau Hall, as members of the Royal family would become Governors General of Canada.

===Confederation and the Dominion===
Prior to the creation of Canada in 1867 through a document called the [[British North America Act]] (BNA) a number of issues were of concern during the discussions over the act. The Fathers of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] had originally wanted to create their new country as "The Kingdom of Canada" and there remained debate over where the capital was to be.  The former issue caused worries that such a name would provoke the [[United States]] to the south.  As a compromise, the term ''[[Dominion]]'' was adopted in the 1867 act as the country's legal title, and ''Dominion of Canada'' would be sanctioned as an official political title for the country.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf ''How Canadians Govern Themselves''] (PDF), pp. 8-9; [http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/flag-drapeau/defi-challenge/reponses-answers_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: National Flag of Canada Day] – see [[Canada's name]]</ref>  Many [[Canada's name|names other than ''Canada'']] had also been proposed, one of which was Victorialand in honour of the Queen.  Ultimately, ''Canada'' stuck.

Debate over whether or not Canada's capital should be in York (now [[Toronto]]), [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City]], or even [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The BNA left it up to the Queen to determine the location, and ultimately the decision did come to rest with Victoria. Many myths surrounding the decision would develop over time. Ultimately the Queen's reasoning was that Bytowne ([[Ottawa]], as it was renamed) was both defensible, located on the [[Ottawa River]] (a major waterway), and sat on the border of [[Upper Canada|Upper]] (English) and [[Lower Canada|Lower]] (French) Canada.

During Victoria's long reign, direct political power moved away from the sovereign.  A series of British acts, many of which Canada was subject to, broadened the social and economic base of the electorate. These acts included the Second Reform Act of 1867; the introduction of the secret ballot in 1872; and the Representation of the Peoples Act of 1884 - all householders and lodgers in accommodation worth at least £10 a year, and occupiers of land worth £10 a year, were entitled to vote.

Despite this decline in the Sovereign's power, Victoria showed that a monarch who had a high level of prestige and who was prepared to master the details of political life could exert an important influence. It was during Victoria's reign that the modern idea of the constitutional monarch, whose role was to remain above political parties, began to evolve. But Victoria herself was not always non-partisan and she took the opportunity to give her opinions, sometimes very forcefully, in private.

After the Second Reform Act of 1867, and the growth of the two-party (Liberal and Conservative) system, the [[Queen]]'s room for manoeuvre decreased. Her freedom to choose which individual should occupy the Premiership (office of the [[Prime Minister]]) was increasingly restricted. 

Victoria was seen as conservative in some respects - like many at the time she opposed giving women the [[vote]], and because she refused to believe women were capable of such, only [[homosexual]] acts by men became illegal. Ironically her son in law, who would become [[Governor General of Canada]], was rumoured to have slipped out of the palace for daliances with the area's soldiers.  On other social issues, however, she tended to favour measures to improve the lot of the poor, such as the Royal Commission on housing. She also supported many charities involved in education, hospitals and other areas.

In 1878 [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Lord Lorne]]'s appointment as [[Governor General of Canada]] was announced, causing excitement throughout the new Dominion. For the first time, [[Rideau Hall]] would have a royal resident – Queen Victoria's fourth daughter. The Canadian Prime Minister relaxed his busy campaign schedule to prepare for her arrival and to organize a special carriage and corps of guards to protect the Princess.

At age 33, the Lord Lorne was Canada's youngest Governor General, but he was not too young to handle the many demands of his post. He and [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]] made many lasting contributions to Canadian society especially in the arts and sciences. They encouraged the establishment of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] and the [[National Gallery of Canada]], even selecting some of its first paintings. In addition to acting as a patron of arts and letters in Canada, Lord Lorne was prolific writer that showed a deep appreciation of Canada's physical beauty.

Throughout his term of office, Lord Lorne was interested in Canada and Canadians, travelling throughout the country encouraging the establishment of numerous institutions, and meeting with members of Canada's First Nations and other Canadians from all walks of life. At Rideau Hall, he and Princess Louise hosted many [[skating]] and tobogganing parties as well as balls, dinners and State occasions.

Princess Louise was an accomplished writer, sculptor and artist – she painted well in both oils and water colours. A door she painted with sprigs of apple blossoms can still be seen in the Monck wing corridor at [[Rideau Hall]]. She gave the name [[Regina]] (which is Latin for Queen) to the capital of [[Saskatchewan]], and Alberta's [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] was named after her. Although she was often unwell, she was a compassionate woman who, during an epidemic of scarlet fever, personally nursed the sick. 

They returned to [[England]] in 1883, living at Kensington Palace until the Lord's death in 1914. Princess Louise died on December 3, 1939, at the age of 91. 

[[Image:Montréal - Square-Victoria, Victoria, 18-38 - 20050308 .jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] at night in [[Victoria Square, Montreal]].]]

In Queen Victoria's latter years, both the Golden (1887) and the Diamond (1897) Jubilees, held to celebrate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the queen's accession, were marked with great displays and public ceremonies. On both occasions, Colonial Conferences attended by the Prime Ministers of the self-governing colonies, inculding Canada's, were held. 

Despite her advanced age, Victoria continued her duties to the end, though the [[Boer War]] in South Africa overshadowed the end of her reign. Along with the [[Crimean War]], many Canadians would die in wars during Victoria's reign, and monuments to them can be found through out the provinces.

Victoria died at [[Osborne House]] on the Isle of Wight, on 22 January 1901 after a reign which lasted almost 64 years, the longest in British and Canadian history. Her long and popular reign resulted in many cities such as [[Victoria, British Columbia]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], being named in her honour, and monuments, such as a statue on Parliament Hill. 

She was buried at Windsor beside Prince Albert, in the Frogmore Royal Mausoleum, which she had built for their final resting place. Above the Mausoleum door are inscribed Victoria's words: 'farewell best beloved, here at last I shall rest with thee, with thee in Christ I shall rise again'.

===Monarchy into the 20th Century=== 
When Queen Victoria died, King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] had been the heir apparent to have held the title Prince of Wales longer than any other before him. In fact it was as forty years earlier as Prince of Wales that he had taken a two month tour of Canada.

Though his reign was short, King Edward VII would be the first monarch to give official recognition to the office of Prime Minister. Having ascended the throne at the age of 59, the King was also the second oldest man to ascend the throne in its history. He would only reign until the age of 68. 

Though Queen Victoria had many years to prepare her son to ascend to the throne she had pointedly kept him out of the affairs of State. Edward however took the opposite approach with his own son, to ensure that Prince George would be better prepared.

In 1901 the Son of King Edward VII, Prince George and his own wife, the Duchess of Cornwall and York, toured across Canada as part of an Empire-wide voyage. In 1908, the Duke returned, as Prince of Wales, to celebrate Quebec City's tercentenary. Though he would not return to Canada the reign of King George V would oversee the first World War as well as great constitutional changes for the British Empire, and set the stage for the rise of the Commonwealth. Events that would have profound effects on the Dominion.

===Monarchy during the "War To End All Wars"===
In 1911 King George V would appoint HRH [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], the Duke of Connaught, as Governor General. Prince Arthur was the third son of Queen Victoria and thus the first member of the Royal family to serve as Governor General of Canada.

During the Prince's term of office, Sir [[Robert Borden]] was Prime Minister and Canada continued to grow and mature as a nation. In 1914, however, [[World War I]] gave Canada one of its greatest challenges. The call to arms as a Dominion of the British Empire between 1914 and 1918 taxed Canada's human and physical resources.

Prince Arthur stressed the importance of Canadian military contributions, but also sought to enhance charity at home. The Connaughts also made an effort to contribute to the social life of the capital, making [[Rideau Hall]] a major site for events for Canadians from across the country. A practice that continues today.

The Prince went to his office in the East Block of Parliament Hill daily when he was in Ottawa. He also travelled throughout Canada with his family, meeting all kinds of Canadians, promoting military training and readiness for Canadian troops. Received with great enthusiasm, [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], now part of [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]], was named in his honour. He also gave his name to Connaught Cup for the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Royal North West Mounted Police]], to encourage pistol marksmanship for recruits. He was active in auxiliary war services and charities and conducted a number hospital visits.

[[Image:PPCLI.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Badge of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry designed by Princess Patricia herself.]] 
Princess Patricia, his daughter also lent her name and support to the raising of a new Canadian army regiment - [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Princess Patricia personally designed its badge and colours for the regiment to take overseas to France. As the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief, she played an active role in the regiment until her death.

In addition to working for the [[Red Cross]] and other organisations, Princess Patricia's mother, the [[Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught|Duchess of Connaught]], for Christmas in 1915, sent a card and a box of maple sugar to every Canadian serving overseas. She also had a knitting machine on which she made thousands of pairs of socks for soldiers. The Duke of Connaught and his family grieved the loss of many of their personal staff serving overseas during the war. Following the war, he commissioned a stained glass window in their memory which is located in St. Bartholomew's Church next to Rideau Hall, which the family attended regularly.

In September of 1916, after the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament buildings]] were almost completely destroyed by fire in February of the same year, Prince Arthur laid the cornerstone for the new buildings in Ottawa. In addition improvements were made to Rideau Hall during the Connaught's term. The present facade, which includes the Royal Coat of Arms carved in stone, was added to the front of the building. The Long Gallery was built, the greenhouse was extended, and a new cloakroom also added. A police guardhouse, the present three-car garage, and a second staff residence were also added to the grounds, in addition to the hundreds of deciduous trees that were planted.

At the end of 1916 Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught publicly stated his regret on leaving Canada, as he and his family had grown very comfortable there.

In the late 1920s the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'' initiated the gradual replacement of the concept of a ''singular'' crown throughout the [[British Empire]] with that of a shared crown making each dominion (as well as the United Kingdom) a separate Realm with the Crown worn by the common monarch.  This was formally outlined in the Statute of Westminster, 1931, when it was given Royal Assent by King George V.  It then meant Dominion Parliaments could now pass laws without reference to [[United Kingdom]] laws, and abolish various reserve powers still possessed by the Crown and Parliament. This paradoxically increased the Monarchy's importance, since the [[Dominions]] (no longer subordinated to one supreme Parliament at Westminster) were now linked through common allegiance to the Crown.

A year later, in 1932 King George gave the first annual Christmas Broadcast by the sovereign to the Empire. This tradition is continued to day as a broadcast to the Commonwealth. 

In 1935, the King celebrated his Silver Jubilee, an occasion of great public rejoicing. However
would die in 1936 and his son Edward succeeded to the throne.

===World War II and the Resident Monarchies===
Preceding [[World War II]], [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] became King unexpectedly following the abdication of his brother, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]], in 1936. George worked to adapt to the role into which he was suddenly thrown. Reserved by nature, and of deep religious belief, he was helped in his work by his wife. He had married Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], who would become "Queen Mother", in 1923. 

In 1939 King George arrived for a tour of [[Canada]], the first ever by Canada's reigning monarch. That same year the King paid the first ever State visit by a British monarch to the United States. Since then Royal tours in [[North America]] would often pair Canada and its neighbour to the south. 

In 1940 following the sudden death of [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir]] while in office, [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]], and uncle of King George VI, was approached to assume the post of [[Governor General of Canada]]. Though they arrived safely, the trip to Canada with his wife, [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice]] (a granddaughter of Queen Victoria) was complicated by the war with [[Nazi]] [[Germany]].

During his time in Office the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice became key supporters of the war effort. Princess Alice became Honorary Commandant of a number of women's military services, and His Excellency travelled extensively in Canada to let them know King George VI was dedicated to fighting [[totalitarianism]]. 

In 1943 and 1944 respectively, the Royal, and Vice-regal couple, hosted American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] at the Quebec Conferences. These meetings in [[La Citadelle]] du Québec helped decide the strategies of the Western Allies that would lead to victory over Nazi Germany and Japan in 1945. 

Though the Governor General, and the [[Chatelaine of Rideau Hall]], were themselves members of the Royal Family, Canada had also become the residence of many of [[Europe]]'s royals. Originally it had been planned that King George VI, Queen Elizabeth (later the "Queen Mother"), and their children would leave [[London]], UK, for [[Ottawa]] for the duration of the War, but it was decided that morale would be diminished if the Royal Family were to abandon the European front.  Instead the arrangements made for Canada's Monarchy was adapted for Europe's leaders in [[exile]]. This would cripple the legitimacy of [[Nazi Germany]]'s attempted conquest of Europe, as its leaders were alive and out of reach. 

[[Image:Stornoway.JPG|right|thumb|275px|[[Stornoway (residence)|Stornoway House]], situated in the prestigious suburb of [[Rockcliffe Park]], was occupied by Princess Juliana and her children during their time of exile.]]
Among Canada's royal guests were [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] and [[Märtha of Sweden|Crown Princess Martha]] of Norway, [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte]] and [[Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Felix]] of Luxembourg, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] of Yugoslavia, [[George II of Greece|King George]] of Greece, Empress [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]] (Austria) and her daughters, as well as [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], Princess [[Juliana of the Netherlands]], Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]], and [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]]. Many of the aforementioned resided at [[Rideau Hall]] itself.

Princess Margriet was born in Ottawa at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Civic Hospital]], where the delivery room was temporarily declared Dutch soil to ensure that the Princess was born in the Netherlands. To this day, Holland sends [[tulip]]s to Ottawa for the [[Tulip Festival (Ottawa)|Tulip Festival]] which commemorates the assistance Canada gave to [[Holland]].

After their term in Canada, Princess Alice would return to Rideau Hall in 1959 as a guest of the Vaniers. She also returned to Ottawa in 1963 when, as honorary colonel of the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, she presented their new regimental colours. Princess Alice died on January 3, 1981 at [[Kensington Palace]], at the age of 97.

===Monarchy After the Wars===
After the War, when [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] became independent in 1947, King George VI ceased to be [[Emperor of India]]. Changes in the Commonwealth meant that its tie was no longer based on common allegiance to the Crown, but upon recognition of the Sovereign as [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. 

These changes in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] relationship, along with the social reforms of the post-war Labour government, occurred against the background of Britain's weak post-war economic position and the beginning of the [[Cold War]], which meant that the privations of war were extended well into the post-war period. 

By 1948, it seemed that the Allies had overcome the worst hardships of the post-war years, but the strain of the Second World War and the tensions of the post-war period had taken their toll on the King's health. The King failed to recover from a lung operation, and died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 at Sandringham; he was aged 56.

To her right, [[Sidney Holland]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]; to her left, [[Robert Menzies]] of [[Australia]] and [[Louis St. Laurent]] of [[Canada]]]] -->
In 1952 the Current Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne of numerous dominions, colonies, and territories, as well as to the headship of the Commonwealth of Nations, though she was already familiar to Canadians, having broadcast for the first time in October 1940, when she was 14, sending a message during the BBC's children's programme to all the children of Britain and the Commonwealth, particularly to those children who were being evacuated for safety reasons.

In early 1945 the Princess was made a Subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). By the end of the war she had reached the rank of Junior Commander, having completed her course at No. 1 Mechanical training Centre of ATS and passed out as a fully qualified driver. She would be the first female monarch to have served in the armed forces.

It was during a 1947 tour of South Africa that she celebrated her twenty-first birthday, and gave a broadcast address dedicating herself to the service of the Commonwealth. This was a first for a female heiress, as it was traditional for the Prince of Wales (which at the time there was none) to make an oath to his future subjects. She repeated her dedication five years later during her [[Oath of office|Coronation Oath]].

Her Majesty's Coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953. The Prime Ministers and leading citizens of all the Commonwealth countries, and representatives of foreign states were present. The ceremony was broadcast on radio around the world and, at The Queen's request, on television. That winter Her Majesty set out to accomplish, as Queen, the Commonwealth tour she had begun before the death of her father.
[[Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Canadian Royal Family]] (left to right: the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne (now Princess Royal), [[Mark Phillips]], Prince Edward (now Earl of Wessex), the Queen, Prince Andrew (now Duke of York), and the Prince of Wales) gathers in [[Lac-Brome, Quebec]], 1976.]]

Since that time the Queen has been present in Canada more than any other monarch before her. In 1957 she toured Ottawa and Hull opening the 1st Session of Canada's 23rd Parliament. Two years later Queen Elizabeth II toured every province and territory and opened the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. In 1964 she would commemorate the Charlotte and Quebec conferences, and another three years later Canada's centennial and attend the [[Expo 67|Montreal Expo]]. 

In 1973 Queen Elizabeth II would host the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings in Ottawa. Receiving them at Rideau Hall. She would be present for many more events ranging from Her Proclamation of the Constitution Act 1982, to her Silver and Golden Jubilees, and mark the anniversaries of the entry of many provinces and territories into confederation.

Her reign has seen the completed transformation of the British Empires' colonies into an association of fully independent and equal Commonwealth members. At the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the ''[[Royal Style and Titles Act]]'' was passed explicitly identifying the Queen's role in the United Kingdom and her role in Canada separately, with her role as Queen of the United Kingdom listed before her role as Queen of Canada. This format was consistent with the form of the Queen's titles in the other Realms, as had been agreed upon by all the Realm governments in 1953. As of 2005, only Canada and [[Grenada]] retain this form. The Queen's title in the UK is similar but only lists that realm by name in the title.

When the [[Canadian House of Commons]] debated the Queen's title in [[1953 in Canada|1953]], Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent asserted:
:"Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom ... It is not a separate office" Hansard February 3, 1953, page 1566. <ref>[http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/QueenofCanada.html Canadian Royal Heritage Trust]</ref>
(see also [[List of Titles and Honours of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]).

Canada gained full independence as an autonomous constitutional monarchy when the [[constitution of Canada|constitution]] was [[patriation|patriated]] under Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Trudeau]], and Proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, in 1982, making it Canadian law rather than an act of the British parliament that required amendment in both jurisdictions. See ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''.

The ''[[Constitution Act of 1982]]'' also entrenched the monarchy in Canada. Any change to the position of the monarch or the monarch's representatives in Canada now requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.

[[Image:ClarksonandQueen2005.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Queen with then Canadian [[Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] during her visit to [[Canada]] in 2005.]]
The Queen has also overseen the transfer of many of her duties to her representatives in Canada. There have often been instances when the Governor General has appeared alongside the Queen at events abroad. Canada's political leaders have also, on occasion, appealed to the Queen's authority. In 1990, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] appealed to the Queen (under Section 26 of ''The Constitution Act, 1867'') to temporarily add new seats to the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. This provision was designed to ensure deadlock in the Senate could be broken. It requires approval by both the Governor General and the monarch. Mulroney made this move to secure passage of the controversial [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] in the face of threats by the Senate to block it. Although Mulroney's [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] had a massive majority in the House of Commons, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] held a majority in the Senate &ndash; until new PC senators were appointed at Mulroney's recommendation to avoid that problem.

This was an occasion on which the Queen played a significant role in Canadian government, although as the monarch's advisers made clear, she felt bound to follow the advice of the Prime Minister, who was answerable to parliament, and the Canadian electorate. They argued that to overrule prime ministerial advice would have involved the Queen directly in controversy; by automatically accepting advice, she placed the responsibility on the person giving the advice.

===Monarchy in the New Millennium===
[[Image:Prince William of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Prince William of Wales|Prince William]] is expected to succeed his father, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], as King of Canada]]

The Canadian Monarchy has evolved greatly over time, adapting to each successive generation. In the new millennium the current Royal Family has maintained the strongest ties to Canada compared to previous generations of royals. They have travelled to, and attended more events than any other non-resident royal in Canada's history.

Like many other public figures, the Monarchy's popularity ebs and flows. Much of its future role in Canada depends as much upon the political elite as it does on public support.

Beginning [[January 1]], [[2005]], the [[Letters of Credence]] that foreign [[diplomat]]s present when beginning an assignment in Canada are addressed to the Governor General of Canada without making any reference to the Queen. This is also the case with [[Letters of Recall]] presented when a diplomat finishes a sojourn in Canada. This change in [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] has been criticised by Canadian monarchists as an example of the government reducing the Queen's role, and has been welcomed by republicans for the same reason.

Some monarchists contend that after [[Paul Martin]] became prime minister, his government seemed to be attempting to further distance Canada from the Queen and elevating the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to more of a presidential figure.

On her 2005 trip to Alberta, the provincial government wished to have the Queen sign a bill into law. This was not done &ndash; in theory because the constitutionality of the Queen doing so was questioned; however, [[Rideau Hall]] also stated it would conflict with the govenment's policy of the "Canadianization" of Canada's institutions. It remains to be seen how the change to a new Conservative government will affect such policies.

==Organizations under Royal Charter==
[[image:hudsonsbayco.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Hudson's Bay Company]], building in [[Montreal]].]]
In the [[Commonwealth Realms]] a [[Royal Charter]] is a [[charter]] granted by the [[monarch]] on the advice of the Privy Council, which creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative and in Canada there are hundreds of organizations under [[Royal Charter]]s. Such organisations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities. Today it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters. Application for a charter is a petition to the Queen in Council. To receive a Royal Charter the organization must have corporate members who have at least first degree level in a relevant field, consist of 5000 members or more, be financially sound, and it must be in the public interest to regulate the institution under a charter. However, meeting these benchmarks does not guarantee the issue of a Royal Charter.

===Companies===
Canada's oldest company, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], was founded under a Royal Charter issued by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1670.

===Cities===
[[Image:Skyline_Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Winnipeg]] skyline]]

Cities under Royal Charter are not subject to municipal Acts of parliament applied generally to other municipalities, and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually. The Royal Charter codifies the laws applied to the particular city, and lays out the powers and responsibilities not given to other municipalities in the province concerned.

Canada has four Royal Charter cities: [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], (the oldest, having received its charter in 1786 from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]), [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Montreal]]. <ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref>

===Universities and colleges===
[[Image:UCC-duke.jpg|thumb|200px|The Queen's consort [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] speaks with UCC First Football team members at the Upper Canada College's 150th anniversary celebrations, 1979]]

A number of Canadian universities and colleges were founded under Royal Charter.
*'''[[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]'''
** 1821: [[McGill University]]
** 1827: King's College - superseded by the [[University of Toronto]]
** 1829: [[Upper Canada College]]
*'''[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'''
** 1841: [[Queen's University]]

===Canadian Organizations with Royal Patronage===
Until [[Industrial Revolution|modern industrial]] times all development of the [[Science]]s and the [[Art]]s were under the direct control of the [[Monarch]]. Leaders have often been acutely aware that [[knowledge]] was power and the best way to keep [[power]] was to control the spread of knowledge.

This initial control was exercised by the foundation of the [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[Universities]]. The endowments to provide for these colleges were once provided by [[the Crown]] to further education in both ecclesiastical and [[secularism|secular]] matters.

As time progressed the educated members of these organisations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and [[debate]] their various subjects. These groups either sought Royal Patronage or were created as [[memorial]]s for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great [[Estate (law)|landed estates]] and in later times by industrialists and finally modern [[corporation|corporate bodies]]. However even in present times relatively new organisations still seek Royal Patronage.

To receive Royal Patronage an organisation must prove to be long lasting, and to be of the highest standard in their field. These organisations such as the [[Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning]], the Royal Canadian Humane Association, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Water Ski & Wakeboard Canada, and the Royal Niagara Military Institute recieve, and have recieved patronage from various monarchs and their families.

==Debate on the Canadian monarchy==
In contrast to [[Australian republicanism]], there has been little national debate about ending the Monarchy in Canada. This may be because Canadians have historically been more focused on more immediate political concerns such as the issue of the role of Quebec within Canada and the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces. These constitutional squabbles have led politicians to shy away from opening further constitutional debate, which changing the Monarchy would invite. Historically, many Canadians have seen the Monarchy as a traditional institution that forms a key part of the nation's ''[[raison d'être]]'' and differentiates Canada from other countries like the [[United States]]. One of Canada's [[national myths]] is the story of the [[United Empire Loyalists]], a group of British-North American settlers who migrated from the United States to Canada after their homes were ransacked during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. {{see|Quebec sovereignty movement}}

In recent years a Canadian republican group has been formed, and some politicians, such as former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]], have expressed interest in ending the Monarchy. In 2002, Canada's first nationally organized republican movement, the [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]], was established to bring the debate into the mainstream. The CCR promotes eliminating the monarch's role as Canada's head of state and replacing an office of birthright with one which is elected. An elected Governor-General is one proposal. The monarchist side is represented by the [[Monarchist League of Canada]]. This national group was formed in 1970 and currently exists as a lobby group to advocate for, educate about, and promote the Canadian Monarchy. Other politicians such as former Deputy Prime Minister [[Sheila Copps]] have been strong supporters of the Monarchy in Canada. Copps was widely praised for her organisation of the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]] tour of Canada in 2002.

Public opinion polls have clearly shown Canadians' mixed feelings towards the Monarchy. Some polls show a majority of Canadians support the creation of a republic, while others show a majority favour retaining the current system. Generally, however, the prevailing mood towards the monarchy suggested by most polls is one of indifference or apathy.

Quebec, however, is currently the only province where the population might be seen as consistently unsupportive of the institution. This sentiment became pronounced during the Queen's visit to [[Quebec City]] in 1964 when she was greeted by antimonarchist demonstrations. The route of her procession was lined with Quebecers showing their backs to the Monarch. On ''Samedi de la matraque'' (Truncheon Saturday), police violently dispersed antimonarchist demonstrators and arrested 36, including some who were there to cheer the Queen. The Queen did not visit Quebec City again until 1987, and has rarely visited Quebec with the exception of [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], which is across the river from [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]] and within Canada's [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]]. <ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/400d.asp?id=1-69-70-192&wm6=1|2 CBC archives]</ref>  Other members of the Royal Family have visited Quebec since the 1980s as a part of various working visits.

In 1976, many Quebec nationalists and sovereigntists complained about the Queen's role in officially opening the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]].

During the [[1995 Quebec referendum]] campaign on independence, the Queen was tricked into revealing her personal opinions on Canadian unity when a radio DJ, impersonating then [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], managed to reach her by telephone at [[Buckingham Palace]]. <ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14934-2020416,00.html Times: Radio Waves: Paul Donovan: It’s a hoax, folks]</ref> <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/618065.stm BBC News: Hoaxing: A national pastime]</ref> When told the current number of votes was showing a victory for the Yes side, she was reported to have said that it was then not "going very well." She also pointedly refused to accept "Chrétien"'s advice that she intervene on the issue without first seeing a draft speech sent by him. (Her tactful handling of the call won plaudits from the DJ who made it.)

Today, many Quebec politicians, especially separatists in parties such as the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]'', often actively ignore the governmental role of the Monarchy on the grounds that it is an institution of "English Canada" with no relevance to Quebec. However, for the same reason, they have not generally advocated republican reforms be taken, as they do not consider reforming Canadian institutions to be their responsibility. Quebec's former separatist premier [[Bernard Landry]] has said that if Quebec separates, the new nation would become a [[republic]]. 

Since the mid-20th century there has been a downplaying of the role of the Crown in Canada. During the centennial year of [[Canadian confederation]] in 1967, some Canadian newspapers, including the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', advocated the creation of a republic as a mark of the country's independence.

From the early 1970s, references to the Monarch and the monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye (e.g., the Queen's portrait from public buildings and schools, and the Royal Mail became a crown corporation, Canada Post). The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were merged into the unified [[Canadian Forces]]; however, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] remain the national police force.

Still, the Monarchy held substantial support during this time, as was demonstrated in the public reaction to the government's Constitutional Amendment Bill C-60, put forward in June, 1978.  Amongst other changes, it made propositions to vest executive authority in the Governor General, and rename the position as First Canadian.  Some academics, [[Edward McWhinney]] for example, supported these changes, however they were strongly opposed by others.  Senator [[Eugene Forsey]] said the government had managed to "[stir] up a hornet's nest with a short stick."  From [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], in 1978, the provincial premiers issued a disparaging statement against the federal government's attempt to unilaterally push changes to the Monarchy, and expressed their opposition to "constitutional changes that substitute for the Queen as ultimate authority a Governor General whose appointment and dismissal would be solely at the pleasure of the federal cabinet."  This message was reiterated at the conclusion of the [[First Ministers conference]] in 1979. <ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

While the ''Toronto Star'' is now no longer officially pro-republic, through the 1990s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' advocated making the Governor General head of state in place of the monarch.  This was completely counter to their editorials in the 1970s which condemned the proposed changes to the constitution outlined in Bill C-60, describing such moves as "[a downgrading] of the symbol most central to Canada's identity," and "crypto-republicanism." <ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

In recent years, there have been some attempts at removing references to the Queen from the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] and the Oath of Citizenship. In the latter case immigration issues drive the discussion for change. To date, only the oath taken by federal public servants has been altered, but they continue to sign contracts with the Queen in the right of Canada. New citizens, members of the armed forces and police forces, and Members of Parliament continue to take Oaths of allegiance to the Queen.

==Notes==
#In 1997, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of Crossharbour.
