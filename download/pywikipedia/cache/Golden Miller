The race horse '''''Golden Miller''''' is the only [[horse]] to have won both of the [[United Kingdom]]'s premier [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] races - the [[Grand National]] and [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] - in the same year ([[1934]]), setting a new course record for [[Aintree Racecourse|Aintree]] in the National. The 1934 win was the middle of five consecutive Gold Cup victories, a Gold Cup record. He was trained by Basil Briscoe, and retired in 1939 with a record of 28 wins from 52 races.


== Coach company ==


The coach operator, Tellings Golden Miller, operating in South West London, is so called because its founder, on the brink of bankruptcy, wagered his remaining savings on the horse and won.  Many of the firm's coaches have a portrait of the horse on the front or side of the vehicle.
