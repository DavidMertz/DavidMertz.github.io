'''Titu Andreescu''' (born [[1956]]) is an associate professor of mathematics at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] [http://www.utdallas.edu/dept/SciMathEd/faculty.htm]. He is also firmly involved in mathematics contests and olympiads, being the Director of [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]] (as appointed by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] [http://www.maa.org/news/titu.html]), Director of [[Mathematical Olympiad  Program|MOP]], Head Coach of the USA [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] Team and Chairman of the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]]. He has also authored a large number of books on the topic of problem solving and olympiad style mathematics.

==Biography==
Titu Andreescu was born in the Romanian city of [[Timişoara]] in 1956. From an early age, an interest in mathematics was encouraged by both his father and uncle Andrew, who was a retired university professor.
As a high school student, Titu excelled in mathematics, and in 1973, 1974 and 1975 won the Romanian national problem solving contests organized by the Journal [[Gazeta Matematică]]. 
After graduating from the [[University of Timişoara]], Andreescu was appointed a professor of mathematics at the Constantin Diaconovici Loga school of Mathematics and Physics. Between the Years 1981–1989 he also worked as the editor-in-chief of the Periodical ''Revista mathematică din Timişoara''.

In 1990 as the [[Eastern Bloc]] began to collapse, Andreescu emigrated to America [http://www.edweek.org/tm/news/sports-and-activities/2004/05/01/06excerpt.h15.html].

==Mathematics coaching and Contests==
During the 1980s, Titu Andreescu served as a coach for the Romanian [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] team and in 1983 was presented with the national award of  "Distinguished Professor". In 1984 he was appointed as "Counselor of the Romanian Ministry of Education".
After emigrating to America, Andreescu became involved in Coaching the American [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] team. His most notable success in came in 1994 when the American team obtained a perfect score at the Hong Kong International Mathematical Olympiad, the first time that any team had achieved this. In recognition of this, Titu was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation from the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for “outstanding service” as coach of the USA Mathematical Olympiad Program.

==AwesomeMath Program==
In 2006, Titu established a math camp for talented middle and high school mathematicians just below Olympiad level. The first AwesomeMath summer program was very effective, with noted professors serving as instructors, and mentors and assistants who had performed well at Olympiads. The program will continue throughout the year as the AwesomeMath Year-round program.
