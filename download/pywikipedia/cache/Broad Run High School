'''Broad Run High School''' is a [[public secondary school]] in [[Ashburn, Virginia]] and is part of the [[Loudoun County Public Schools|Loudoun County Public Schools system (LCPS)]]. The school's [[principal (school)|principal]] is Edgar Markley, [[Ed.D.]] Of the county's ten public high schools, Broad Run has experienced the most change in both its physical and demographic environments during its nearly four decades of existence. Originally a rural school serving all of eastern [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], the explosive growth of the county's population beginning in 1995 has resulted in systematic reduction of Broad Run's attendance area as it spun off six of the district's high schools from within its original boundaries. Initial surroundings of farm fields have been replaced by densely populated housing tracts and the school now experiences one of the most culturally diverse student populations in the region.

==History==
[[Image:Broad run high school - 01.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The front of Broad Run High School as of 2006]]The district's third high school, Broad Run opened in 1969 serving grades 8&ndash;12 for eastern Loudoun County,<ref name="brhs-shield01">{{cite book | last = Graham | first = Liz | coauthors = Nancy Scott| title = The Shield (Vol. I) | publisher = Broad Run High School |date= 1970}}</ref> including all of Ashburn, [[Arcola, Virginia|Arcola]], western [[Chantilly, Virginia|Chantilly]] (what is now known as [[South Riding, Virginia|South Riding]]), and [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]].  Named for the nearby [[Potomac River]] [[tributary]], Broad [[Stream#Other names for streams|Run]] was dedicated on [[October 13]], [[1969]]. The ceremony's keynote address was delivered by then-Governor of Virginia, [[Mills E. Godwin Jr.]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Graham | first = Liz | coauthors = Nancy Scott| title = The Shield (Vol. I) | publisher = Broad Run High School |date= 1970 | pages = p. 9}}</ref> At the time, Loudoun's three high schools were not limited to 9<sup>th</sup> through 12<sup>th</sup> grades since there were no [[middle school#North America|middle schools]]. Broad Run, therefore, had a "Thetamen" class for two years, its name for eighth graders (similar to calling ninth graders "Freshmen").<ref name="brhs-shield01"/> By 1973 the Thetamen were shifted to newly opened middle schools and in 1976 a portion of the Sterling student body was moved to [[Park View High School (Sterling, Virginia)|Park View High School]].{{Fact}}  As the Ashburn area grew considerably, additional students shifted to [[Potomac Falls High School]] in 1997.{{Fact}}  [[Stone Bridge High School]] opened in 2000, which split the Ashburn student body into two different high schools.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stone Bridge readies for opening | publisher = Loudoun Times-Mirror | url = http://www.loudountimes.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=775131&BRD=2553&PAG=461&dept_id=576934&rfi=8 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}</ref>  Broad Run gave the remainder of its Sterling student population to Potomac Falls after [[Dominion High School]] opened in 2003 and shifted students in [[Brambleton, Virginia|Brambleton]] to Stone Bridge.{{Fact}}  In 2005, Broad Run split off its South Riding students to [[Freedom High School (South Riding, Virginia)|Freedom High School]].{{Fact}}

Broad Run High School is not the first high school in Ashburn, however: a public school, known as Ashburn High School, was built for both elementary and high school white students in 1911 (a separate school for [[African-Americans]] was built in 1892 in Old Ashburn). The four-room wood frame schoolhouse initially cost $6,000. Additions to the original structure were made in 1922, 1930, and 1934. The school served Ashburn students until [[February 14]], [[1944]], when the entire building was destroyed by fire. Its replacement, an elementary-only brick structure, was constructed in 1945 and is still in use; known as the Ashburn Annex, it is a training center for the LCPS district.<ref>{{cite web | title = The History of Ashburn Schools | publisher = AshburnWeb | url = http://www.ashburnweb.com/history/histschl.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-25 }}</ref>

===Enrollment history===
Broad Run's student population averaged 1,486 students during the period 1995 &ndash; 2006. The county's steady population increases during this time resulted in accompanying student body expansions, periodically relieved as other high schools opened in eastern Loudoun County (note the population drops in the table below as these schools opened — Potomac Falls in 1997, Stone Bridge in 2000, Dominion in 2003 and Freedom in 2005).<ref name="vdoe-census">{{cite web | title = VA Dept of Education Fall Membership Data Collection (1995-2006) | publisher = Virginia Dept of Education |date= | url = http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/Publications/rep_page.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-03}}</ref>

The Broad Run attendance boundaries encompass the [[Ashburn, Virginia|Ashburn]] communities of [[Ashburn Village]], Farmwell Hunt, and University Center, as well as the Ridges at Ashburn and Ashbrook residential subdivisions.<ref name="HS attendance">{{cite web | title = High School Attendance Boundaries | publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/509905169119/blank/browse.asp?a=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&c=55408 | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-12-25 }}</ref> The LCPS middle school of [[Farmwell Station Middle School|Farmwell Station]] and, by extension, the elementary schools Ashburn Elementary, Dominion Trail and Cedar Lane feed students to the high school.<ref name="HS attendance"/> A limited number of students living in neighboring communities outside the current attendance boundary, such as [[South Riding, Virginia|South Riding]], [[Ashburn Farm]] and [[Brambleton, Virginia|Brambleton]] also attend as a result of frequent boundary change "grandfathering".{{Fact}}

[[Image:BRHS Ethnic Breakdown Graph.JPG|thumb|375px|right|Broad Run Ethnicity Analysis — 2006/2007]]
The ethnic/racial composition of Broad Run's student body in 2006 &ndash; 2007 is 64% White; 11% Black; 11% Hispanic; and 14% Asian.<ref name="vdoe-census"/>

==Administration and faculty==
The school's administrative team is headed by the [[principal (school)|principal]], Dr. Edgar Markley, a 2003 recipient of a [[The Washington Post|''The Washington Post's'']] Annual Distinguished Educational Leadership Award.<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Distinguished Educational Leadership Awards (2003) | publisher = The Washington Post |date= 2003 | url = http://www.washpost.com/community/education/dela/2003recipients/Markley.shtml | accessdate = 2006-12-23 }}</ref> The team includes three [[assistant principal]]s, the director of [[School and guidance counselor|guidance]], and the athletic director. The principal and school, as part of LCPS, are under the direction of the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], who operates under the authority of the Loudoun County [[Board of education|Board of Education]].

==Curriculum==
:''See Main Discussion: [[Loudoun County Public Schools#High Schools|Loudoun County Public Schools – Curriculum]]''

Students mainly attend classes on the Broad Run campus, but have opportunities to take additional, specialized courses at LCPS's magnet and alternative schools, such as science and math at [[Loudoun Academy of Science]] and vocational education classes at C.S. Monroe Technology Center.

The school's instructional curriculum is set primarily by the LCPS district office based on Virginia Department of Education requirements. Broad Run's curriculum is typical of Virginia and United States [[High school#United States|secondary schools]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Broad Run Academics Overview| publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006/7 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/51620112123759720/site/default.asp | accessdate =  2006-12-27}}</ref> Broad Run is one of only three LCPS schools teaching [[Mandarin Chinese]] (initiated in 2006 &ndash; 2007).<ref>{{cite news | title = New Instructional Programs | publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= August 25, 2006 | url = http://www.loudoun.k12.va.us/509759161361/cwp/view.asp?A=3&Q=375532&C=69263 | accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref>

Students attending the Loudoun Academy of Science at [[Dominion High School]] in Sterling and C.S. Monroe Technology Center in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] do so every other class day, taking their non-magnet classes (typically core courses, such as English, social sciences and electives) at Broad Run on the alternate days.

===Instruction schedule===
[[Image:Broad run algebra class.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Broad Run Algebra class (2007)]]
Like the other nine Loudoun County high schools, Broad Run's regular instruction schedule begins at 9:00 AM and ends at 3:48 PM on all school days.<ref>{{cite web | title = Loudoun County Public Schools - 2006-2007 Student Bell Schedule | publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006/2007 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/50975427144147/blank/browse.asp?a=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&c=69847&50975427144147Nav=|&NodeID=2238 | accessdate = 2006-12-17}}
</ref> Loudoun County high schools begin the school day much later than neighboring districts, such as [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Fairfax County Public Schools (Centreville High School) Bell Schedule | publisher = [[Fairfax County Public Schools]] |date= 2006/2007| url = http://www.fcps.edu/CentrevilleHS/bell.htm#top | accessdate = 2006-12-17}}</ref> and [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Prince William County Public Schools (Battlefield High School) Bell Schedule | publisher = [[Prince William County Public Schools]] |date= 2006/2007| url = http://www.battlefieldhighschool.org/Battlefield%20Info/Documents/Bell%20Lunch%20Schedule%20SY06-07%20asofSept12_PDF.pdf | accessdate = 2006-12-17}}</ref> where most schools open at around 7:30 AM and close between 2:00 and 2:30 PM.

Broad Run operates on an 8-period block schedule, alternating each day. Periods 1-4 meet in order on A days (also known as Maroon days, after the school's colors); and periods 5-8 are on B (Gold) days.<ref>{{cite web | title = Broad Run High School: Bell Schedule| publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006/7 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/5096042710947/blank/browse.asp?a=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&c=53057&516Nav=|48|&NodeID=48 | accessdate =  2006-12-22}}</ref> Periods are 90 minutes in length. Some students, usually seniors with enough credits toward graduation, may have an "Early Release" from school to participate in school approved activities or work.{{Fact}}

Students attending classes at the LCPS magnet schools [[Loudoun Academy of Science]] or C.S. Monroe Technology Center usually do so on B/Gold days.{{Fact}}

====Flex and Spartan Read====
Since students generally have only seven courses, period 6 is designated as the Flex period. Flex consists of two half-periods during which normal classes are not held (taking place on B/Gold day). Instead, students report to two 41-minute subject-specific [[study hall|study halls]] or review sessions.<ref name="2ndQ flex">{{cite web | title = Broad Run High School FLEX Block Rotation Schedule (2nd Quarter) | publisher = Broad Run High School | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/brhs/lib/brhs/Flex_Sched/2nd_qtr_flex.pdf?516Nav=|&NodeID=49 | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}
</ref> The Flex period was introduced in 2003 &ndash; 2004;<ref name="no study hall">{{cite news | last = Zentz | first = Andrea | title = No More Study Hall | publisher = The Connection Newspapers | date = September 2, 2004 | url = http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?archive=true&article=36785&paper=67&cat=137 | accessdate =  2007-01-09}}</ref> prior to this Broad Run started every day with the same class for 45 minutes, while the rest of the day consisted of three sets of 90 minute periods that alternated every day (still named A/Maroon and B/Gold days).

Each student's subject periods (1 &ndash; 5 and 7 &ndash; 8) are evenly rotated through the Flex periods on a predetermined schedule, and school policy dictates that the Flex period is not to be used for introduction of new material, but for review or individual help.<ref name="SIP">{{cite web | title = Broad Broad Run High School Annual School Plan for 2006-2007 | publisher = Broad Run High School | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/50990548596/lib/50990548596/sip_plan.pdf?516Nav=|&NodeID=2512 | accessdate = 2007-01-09}} </ref> Students can also utilize the time to complete assignments or make up late work. Occasionally, these periods are used for assemblies, administrative [[home room#United States|home rooms]] or other activities (thus the name "Flex").<ref name="2ndQ flex"/> During the 2004 &ndash; 2005 the school year a [[sustained silent reading|reading program]] was begun: during the first 15 minutes of the first of the two Flex periods all students perform silent reading of a book or magazine of their choice.<ref name="SIP"/>

===Academic performance and achievement===
====Accreditation====
Broad Run is a fully accredited high school<ref name="vde-sol-2005-6">{{cite web | title = 2006-2007 Accreditation Ratings | publisher = Virginia Department of Education |date= 2006/2007 | url = http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/src/accred-final-05.xls | format = [[Microsoft Excel]] | accessdate = 2006-12-23 }}</ref> based on the [[Standards of Learning|Standards of Learning (SOL)]] examinations in Virginia (all but five of Loudoun County's 66 public schools are fully accredited). Virginia high schools are considered fully accredited if students achieve pass rates of 70% or above in all four content areas (English, mathematics, history/social science, and science) on SOL examinations administered during the previous school year. Broad Run's current pass rates (2006 &ndash; 2007) are: English – 95%; Math – 87%; History – 91%; and Science – 85%.<ref name="vde-sol-2005-6"/>

====NCLB and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)====
To meet the requirements of the federal [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)]], the state of Virginia utilizes its [[Standards of Learning|Standards of Learning (SOL)]] examinations as its progress measurement tool. NCLB requires states to set annual measurable objectives of proficiency in reading and mathematics, participation in testing, and graduation and attendance. These objectives are in addition to the high standards for learning and achievement required under Virginia’s SOL program. Schools and school divisions that meet the annual objectives required by the federal education law are considered to have made adequately yearly progress (AYP) toward the goal of 100 percent proficiency of all students in reading and mathematics by 2014.<ref name="vde-reportcard">{{cite web | title = NCLB - School Report Card | publisher = Virginia Department of Education |date= 2006/2007 | url = http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/src/index.shtml | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}</ref>

Broad Run has maintained Adequate Yearly Progress for the school years 2003 &ndash; 2004 through 2005 &ndash; 2006.<ref name="vde-reportcard"/> The percentage of students passing the English and Math tests at Broad Run averages slightly higher than Loudoun County as a whole, but lags slightly behind in Science by three points.<ref name="vde-reportcard"/>

==Extracurricular activities==
Broad Run High School offers a number of activities to its students and staff outside the regular instructional curriculum. All school sponsored clubs and activities are supervised by a faculty or staff member, although much of the organizational responsibilities are often handled by students. In addition to the fine arts, athletic and other programs detailed below, the extracurricular activities sponsored by the school range from service organizations (Environmental Club and [[Key Club]]) to academic ([[National Honor Society]] and Academic Team & Signet) to professional ([[DECA (organization)|DECA]] and [[FBLA]]) to cultural (Muslim Student Association, German Club, [[Gay-Straight Alliance]] and Spanish Club) to special interests (Chess Club and Dance Team).<ref>{{cite web | title = Broad Run Activities Directory | publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/brhs/site/Directory_List.asp?byType=50 | accessdate = 2006-12-26 }}</ref>

===Drama===
In addition to its drama instruction, Broad Run students and staff produce and stage at least three major theatrical performances each year. These productions include a full-length play in the fall, a one-act festival in the winter, and a musical in the spring.  Participation in a show is open to all students, regardless of enrollment in a drama class.<ref>{{cite web | title = Broad Run High School Drama | publisher = Loudoun County Public Schools |date= 2006 | url = http://cmsweb1.loudoun.k12.va.us/509505495554/site/default.asp? | accessdate = 2006-12-26 }}</ref> 2005 and 2006 productions included ''[[The Government Inspector]]'', ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' and ''[[Noises Off]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = ‘Inspector’ Comes to Town at Broad Run
