'''''Armour of God''''' (Long xiong hu di) is a [[1987]] [[Jackie Chan]] [[film]]. The film is a cross between Chan's regular [[kung-fu]]/[[comedy]] and ''[[Indiana Jones]]''. During a relatively routine stunt in this film Chan came the closest he has ever been to death when a tree branch snapped sending Chan plummeting a huge distance and cracking his skull.


==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
In the movie Jackie plays the character of ''Asian Hawk'' (the character's real-name being also Jackie), an adventurer with a mercenary-like way of thought. Jackie used to perform in a band with his friends Alan and Laura (Lorelei) before he was kicked out of the band by Alan, who wanted Laura for himself. At the beginning of the film Jackie steals a sword from an African tribe that is one of the five pieces of a valuable armour known as the Armour of God. Alan is still a successful singer and Laura is a renowned fashion-designer,

An evil cult wants to destroy the armour and has already collected two pieces of it. To get the final three pieces they kidnap Laura to force Alan to get Jackie to collect the remaining pieces of the armour for the cult.
This film was taped in Croatia and Slovenia.

==Box Office==

At the Hong Kong box office, ''Armour of God'' was Jackie Chan's biggest hit up to that point, grossing HK $35,469,408 in its theatrical run.

==US Version==

In North America, ''Armour of God'' was released direct-to-video by Miramax after the theatrical distribution of its sequel, ''[[Armour of God 2: Operation Condor]]'', which was released in North America as simply ''[[Operation Condor]]''.  As such, the title ''Armour of God'' was changed, somewhat confusingly, to ''Operation Condor 2: The Armor of the Gods''.
A new musical score was created for this release, and English dubbing (with the participation of Chan) was also done.
Nine minutes of cuts were made to the Miramax version, including:
- The concert scene of [[Jackie Chan's]] band, 'The Losers.'
- Chan's dream sequence.
- The scene in which May, disguised as a prostitue, encounters a monk who wants to sleep with her.
- An extended version of the slapstick sequence in which [[Alan Tam]] hides in May's room.
