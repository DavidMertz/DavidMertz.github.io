'''ArrayOS''' is an [[operating system]] developed by [[Array Networks]].

This proprietary operating system designed to be included in the hardware boxes the company produces is able to handle secure web traffic. It uses SSL ([[Secure Sockets Layer]]), cache and [[data compression]] techniques.

Version 6.1 (out in 2005) also has the ability to manage the load between different [[server farm]]s. Previous versions of the OS were limited to a single server.
