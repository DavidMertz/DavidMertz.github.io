'''''Cuesta Verde''''' is a fictional city in [[California]].  It appears predominantly in the [[Poltergeist (film series)]], as well as [[House of the Dead 2 (film)|House of the Dead 2]].

In the Poltergeist films, Cuesta Verde is actually [[Simi Valley, California]], with the Freeling household located at 4267 Roxbury Street.  In the House of the Dead 2 film, the college is named Cuesta Verde, possibly in reference to Poltergeist.

In Spanish, Cuesta Verde literally means "Green Slope" which is probably in reference to the hills that surround Simi Valley.
