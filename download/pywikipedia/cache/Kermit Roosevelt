'''Kermit Roosevelt I''' ([[October 10]], [[1889]] – [[June 4]], [[1943]]) was a son of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (also known as TR). Born into TR's remarkable family, Kermit was an explorer on two continents with his father, graduate of [[Harvard University]], a courageous [[soldier]] serving in two world wars, a successful [[businessman]], and a gifted [[writer]]. Despite his many talents and interesting life, he fought a life-long battle with [[clinical depression|depression]].

==Childhood==

Kermit was born at the Roosevelt residence [[Sagamore Hill]] in [[Oyster Bay, New York]].  He was the second child born to Theodore Roosevelt and his second wife, Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt. Kermit's oldest brother was [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.|Theodore Jr.]], nicknamed Ted and Teddy. His younger siblings were [[Ethel Roosevelt Derby|Ethel]], [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archibald]], and [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]]. He also had an older half sister, [[Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth|Alice]], from his father's first marriage to [[Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt|Alice Roosevelt]].

As a child, he was a delicate boy with little resistance to illness and infection. His nurse, knowing of his small appetite, would entice him to eat steak by calling it "tender-lion." Kermit had a natural flair for language and was an avid reader. Always a sensitive child, he didn't take well to teasing and his siblings had to learn to respect his quiet and introspective nature. As a young child, he showed a talent for writing that would lead to his recording his experiences in World War I that he published in book form.

==Education==

After attending the [[Groton School]], Kermit attended college at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. In [[1908]] as a freshman, he and TR, his father, both of whom loved nature and outdoor sports went on a [[safari]] in [[Africa]]. After this trip and a swing through Europe, Kermit returned to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and completed a four years of study in two and one-half years.

==River of Doubt South American expedition==
One of Kermit's father's most popular books, ''[[Through the Brazilian Wilderness]]'', was about the heroic father-and-son expedition into the [[Amazon Basin]] [[Brazil]]ian jungle in 1913. Kermit and TR went on what would become known as the [[Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition]], exploring the Brazilian jungle with famous Brazilian explorer Colonel [[Cândido Rondon]]. During this expedition, they discovered the Rio of Doubt, later renamed [[Rio Roosevelt]] in honor of the President as well as branch of that river would be named the [[Rio Kermit]] in Kermit's honor. 

At the time of the expedition, Kermit was newly engaged to Belle Willard, daughter of the U.S. Ambassador to Spain. Kermit's mother, Edith, was very concerned about his father's health and the difficulties of a new expedition and asked Kermit to accompany his father. Kermit was not excited about delaying his marriage, but decided it best to go with his father. Events would demonstrate that this was a fortuitous decision. Had Kermit not gone to South America, in all likelihood, his famous father would have not returned alive.

[[Image:Kermit_Roosevelt_Amazon_Expedition_1913.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Kermit grew a beard during the trip while he and his father fought loss of equipment, disease, drowning and murder during their 1913 expedition up the [[River of Doubt]] in the [[Amazon Basin]]]]

While the expedition started well, a change was made to the goals of the expedition and it was decided that an exploratory trip would be made to trace the River of Doubt from its source to determine its path through hundreds of kilometers/miles of uncharted [[rain forest]]. The difficulties of the harsh climate with its torrential downpours, incredibly rough terrain, unseaworthy low-running dugout canoes, a seemingly endless series of difficult rapids and waterfalls, diminishing food supplies, the drowning of one expedition member and the murder of another and a host of other problems turned what began as a scientific expedition into a race against time to save the life of a dying former president. [[Malaria]] and a serious infection resulting from a minor leg wound had developed into a life-threatening situation. These illnesses so weakened TR, that by six weeks into the expedition, TR had to be attended day and night by the expedition's physician and his son, Kermit. TR considered his own condition a threat to the survival of the others. With the loss of many of their dugout canoes and provisions, and his father sick from [[malaria]] and infections, Kermit raced against time to bring his father back alive from the jungle. In a letter to a friend later, TR recalled considering taking a lethal dose of morphine because his sickness had reduced him to total dependence on the others and this wasn't the Roosevelt way. Kermit courageously stood up to the dying old man, and told him that he was bringing him back literally "dead or alive" and if he died, he would be an even bigger burden to the expedition. Without a doubt, it was Kermit who saved his father's life when this expedition had degenerated into a horrible ordeal.

During that expedition, Kermit himself came close to death by [[malaria]]. In order to save [[quinine]] for his father, he downplayed his own malarial sickness until the expedition's doctor was forced to give it to him by injection. By that time, his attempts to disguise his losing fight with the disease had come close to killing him. 

TR was having chest pains when he tried to walk, his temperature soared to 103 and, at times he was delirious. By now so weakened that he could not even sit up in his dugout but had to lie on his back. When the expedition finally reached civilization, TR had to be carried by off by stretcher. He had lost over fifty pounds. Kermit and all the expedition's members' physical conditions had suffered as well. 

In the final analysis, without Kermit's rope and canoe-handling skills preserving the dugouts from destruction (the one thing that would have quickly and fatally ended the expedition), his unflinching courage, dogged determination, - in short, the devotion and loving support of a dedicated son, it is unlikely that TR would have survived the expedition. Besides the newly-named Rio Roosevelt, one branch of the river was named the Rio Kermit in Kermit's honor. Today, the [[Rio Roosevelt]] is commonly called the [[Rio Teodoro]] by [[Portuguese-speaking]] Brazilians because of pronunciation difficulties they have with the name 'Roosevelt'.

Upon his return by ship to New York, friends and family were startled at TR's physical appearance, for he was no longer the vibrant man with a seemingly endless supply of energy that they had always known. Indeed, TR would write a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. He did not realize, at that time, just how accurate his analysis would prove to be. The effects of the South America expedition had so greatly weakened TR that they significantly contributed to his declining health. For the rest of his life, he would be plagued by flareups of malaria and inflammation so severe that they would require hospitalization. <ref name="lion"/><ref>Thayer, Chapter XXIII, pp. 4&ndash;7.</ref> 

When TR and Kermit had recovered from their ordeal, they found that they had a new battle on their hands. In professional circles, there was doubt about their claims of having discovered and navigated a completely uncharted river over 1000 km long. TR and Kermit had to fight for official recognition of the expedition's discovery of the newly-named [[Rio Roosevelt]]. Toward this end, TR went to Washington, DC, and spoke at a standing-room-only convention to defend his discovery. His official report and its defense silenced the critics and TR was able to triumphantly return to his home in [[Oyster Bay]]. 

TR would record these harrowing experiences in one of his most popular books, ''[[Through the Brazilian Wilderness]].'' The 1913 expedition would later be recounted in the Book, "The River of Doubt."

==Marriage in 1914==
After the Amazon trip, in 1914 Kermit married Belle Willard, daughter of the U.S. Ambassador to Spain. They had four children:
* [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]] (1916 - 2000)
* Joseph Willard Roosevelt (1918 - )
* Belle Wyatt Roosevelt (1919 - 1985)
* Dirck Roosevelt (1925 - 1952)

From 1914 to 1916 Kermit was Assistant Manager for the [[National City Bank]] in [[Buenos Aires]].

==Military Service in World War I==
[[Image:Kermit_Roosevelt.png|left|thumb|Kermit Roosevelt - John Singer Sargent's sketch from the cover of his book on his wartime experiences in Iraq called ''War in the Garden of Eden'']]
In 1917 as he was about to be transferred to a Russian branch, the U.S. entered the World War. Kermit accepted a Captaincy in the British Army and saw hard fighting in the Near East, later transferring to the United States Army. While his other brothers had had summer training at Plattsburg, New York, Kermit had missed out on this training.

Kermit joined the [[British Army]] to fight in the [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day Iraq) theater of [[World War I]]. He was attached to the 14th Light Armoured Motor Battery of the [[Machine Gun Corps]], but the British High Command decided they could not risk his life and so they made him an officer in charge of transport (ancient [[Ford Model T]] cars). From then on, however, Captain Roosevelt made it his main aim in life to get his Ford in front of the Armor. With his incredible talent for languages, within months of being posted to Mespotamia, he had mastered spoken as well as written Arabic and was often relied upon as a translator with the locals. As in Africa with his father, he was courageous to the point of recklessness. He was awarded a well-earned [[Military Cross]]. When the United States joined the war, Kermit got transferred to the [[American Expeditionary Force|AEF]] in Europe.  In 1919, he learned that his youngest brother, [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]], had been shot down over France and had been buried by the Germans with full military honors.

==Post WW I Experience==
After the expedition, Roosevelt went into business, he founded the Roosevelt Steamship Company and the [[United States Lines]]. Ever a Roosevelt, Kermit continued to enjoy outdoor activities with his brothers.

In [[1929]] Kermit went to [[China]] with his brother [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.|Theodore Roosevelt II]] in search of a [[Giant Panda]] to stuff and put on display in a museum.

==World War II Service==
Kermit joined the British again in [[World War II]] and served with distinction until he was debilitated by [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]] and was so greatly weakened by these illnesses, that he was given a medical discharge. Kermit appealed this discharge all the way to the British [[Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]]. But Churchill, after reviewing his record, upheld the medical discharge. When he returned to the US, he turned to drinking to forget his problems. So worried was his wife, about his deteriorating condition, that she went to the extreme of seeking the help of Kermit's cousin, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (also known as FDR). FDR ordered the [[FBI]] to track him down and he was brought back to his family. FDR thought it would be best if he were moved as far as possible from some of his friends who were such a negative influence on him. FDR had given him a commission as a major in the [[United States Army]], and had him transferred and posted to [[Fort Richardson]], [[Alaska]], where he worked as an intelligence officer and helped establish a territorial militia of Eskimos and Aleuts.

==Battle with Depression and Related Alcoholism==
A tendency toward depression seems to have come from Kermit's father's side of the family. His grandmother, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s mother, [[Martha Bulloch]] had led a life with supreme highs as well as debilitating lows. His father's brother, [[Elliott Roosevelt I]] was afflicted with chronic bouts of depression. Like Kermit, they would lead to alcoholism and, eventually, to his early death at fifty-four.

==Death==
In Alaska, far from home, Kermit continued to fight his life-long battle with chronic depression and alcohol. He committed [[suicide]] on June 4, 1943, by a self-inflicted gunshot. His death was reported to his mother, [[Edith Kermit Roosevelt]], whose favorite son he was, as a heart attack. Sensitive to his tragic demise, for many years, the [[cause of death]] continued to be described as heart failure. Only in later years did the true circumstances of his death become known. He was interred in [[Fort Richardson National Cemetery]] near Anchorage, where a memorial stone gateway was erected in his honor in [[1949]].

He was survived by his wife Belle and four children: [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.|Kermit "Kim" Roosevelt, Jr.]], [[Joseph Willard Roosevelt]], [[Belle Wyatt Roosevelt]], and [[Dirck Roosevelt]].

==His Son and the CIA==


==Trivia==
* The town of [[Kermit, Texas]] was named for him (he had visited [[Winkler County, Texas]] a few months earlier to hunt [[antelope]])

* The [[Luzon class repair ship|''Luzon''-class repair ship]] [[USS Kermit Roosevelt (ARG-16)|USS ''Kermit Roosevelt'' (ARG-16)]] was named in his honor.
