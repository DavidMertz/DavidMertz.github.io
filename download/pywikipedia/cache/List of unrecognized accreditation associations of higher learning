Schools that lack legitimate accreditation often claim accreditation from an unrecognized source. In the United States without recognition from the [[United States Department of Education]] or the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] to approve the accreditation agency such accreditations are "bogus" to the academic community[http://www.chea.org/pdf/fact_sheet_6_diploma_mills.pdf].  Students that attend schools that are accrediated through accreditation associations not recognized by the US Department of Education will not qualify for title four funding (Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, etc.) The following is a '''list of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning''', which should not be taken as exhaustive.
