The '''Colt-Browning Mk 12''' was a 20 mm [[cannon]] widely used by the [[US Navy]] after [[World War II]].

==Development==
The '''Mk 12''' was an advanced derivative of the wartime [[Hispano 20 mm cannon|Hispano HS 404]] that had been used on a variety of [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fighter aircraft]] during [[World War II|World War Two]]. It used a lighter projectile with a bigger charge for better [[muzzle velocity]] and faster rate of fire at the cost of hitting power. It entered [[US Navy]] and [[USMC]] service in the mid-[[1950s]], replacing the Navy's earlier '''M3''' cannon.

In service, the Mk 12 proved less than satisfactory. Although its muzzle velocity and rate of fire were acceptable, it was inaccurate and frequently unreliable. Pilots of the [[F-8 Crusader]] over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], in particular, appreciated the presence of the cannon, but jams and stoppages were common, especially following hard dogfighting maneuvers. 

Nevertheless, the Mk 12 was standard cannon armament on gun-armed Navy and Marine Corps fighters from the early [[1950s]] to the early [[1960s]], including the [[F4D Skyray]], [[F-3 Demon]], [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[F-8 Crusader]], and [[A-7 Corsair II]].

The Mk 12 is ''not'' the same as the Pontiac [[M39 cannon]] used on the [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[F-101]] of the [[USAF]], despite the similar caliber.
