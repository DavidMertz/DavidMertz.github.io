The '''Southern Pacific Railroad''' {{Reporting mark|SP}} was an [[United States|American]] [[railroad]]. The railroad was founded as a land holding company in [[1865]], forming part of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] empire. The Southern Pacific's total route miles has varied significantly over the years. In 1929 the system showed 13,848 miles of track (in contrast to 8,991 miles of track in 1994). By 1900, the Southern Pacific Company had grown into a major railroad system which incorporated many smaller companies, such as the Texas and New Orleans Railroad and Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad, and which extended from New Orleans through Texas to El Paso, across New Mexico and through [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], throughout most of California including [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]; it absorbed the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] extending eastward across [[Nevada]] to [[Ogden, Utah]] and had lines reaching north throughout and across [[Oregon]] to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. 

On [[August 9]], [[1988]], the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] approved the purchase of the Southern Pacific by [[Rio Grande Industries]], the company that controlled the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]]. The Rio Grande officially took control of the Southern Pacific on [[October 13]], [[1988]]. After the purchase, the combined railroad kept the Southern Pacific name due to its brand recognition in the railroad industry and with customers of both constituent railroads. The Southern Pacific subsequently was taken over by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in [[1996]] following years of financial problems. The railroad is also noteworthy for being the defendant in the landmark [[1886]] [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' which is often interpreted as having established certain [[corporation|corporate rights]] under the [[Constitution of the United States]].

==Locomotive paint and appearance==
[[Image:OP-15947.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Southern Pacific Railroad #4274, a type [[4-8-8-2]] "cab-forward" steam locomotive, leads a California-Nevada Railroad Historical Society excursion out of [[Reno, Nevada]] in December of 1957.]]
Like most railroads, the SP painted the majority of its [[steam locomotive]] fleet black during the 20th century, but after the 1930s the SP had a policy of painting the front of the locomotive's [[smokebox]] light silver (almost white in appearance), with graphite colored sides, for visibility.  

Some express passenger steam locomotives bore the ''Daylight'' scheme, named after the trains they hauled, most of which had the word ''Daylight'' in the train name. This scheme, carried in full on the [[tender (locomotive)|tender]], consisted of a bright, almost vermilion red on the top and bottom thirds, with the center third being a bright orange. The parts were separated with thin white bands.  Some of the color continued along the locomotive. The most famous "Daylight" locomotives were the [[Southern Pacific class GS-4|GS-4]] [[steam locomotives]]. The most famous Daylight-hauled trains were the Coast Daylight and the Sunset Limited.

Well known were the Southern Pacific's unique "[[cab forward|cab-forward]]" steam locomotives. These were essentially [[2-8-8-4]] locomotives set up to run in reverse, with the [[tender locomotive|tender]] attached to the smokebox end of the locomotive. Southern Pacific used a number of snow sheds in mountain terrain, and locomotive crews nearly asphyxiated from smoke blowing back to the cab. After a number of engineers began running their engines in reverse (pushing the tender), Southern Pacific asked [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] to produce cab-forward designs. No other North American railroad ordered cab-forward locomotives, which became a distinctive symbol of the Southern Pacific.

During the early days of [[diesel locomotive]] use, they were also painted black.  Yard [[switcher]]s had diagonal orange stripes painted on the ends for visibility, earning this scheme the nickname of ''[[Tiger Stripes colour scheme|Tiger Stripe]]''. Road freight units were generally painted in a black scheme with a red band at the bottom of the carbody and a silver and orange "winged" nose.  The words "SOUTHERN PACIFIC" were borne in a large serif font in white.  This paint scheme is called the ''Black Widow'' scheme by railfans. A transitory scheme, of all-over black with orange "winged" nose, was called the ''Halloween'' scheme.  Few locomotives were painted in this scheme and few photos of it exist.

Most passenger units were painted originally in the ''Daylight'' scheme as described above, though some were painted red on top, silver below for use on the ''[[Golden State (passenger train)|Golden State]]'' (operated in cooperation with the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Railroad]]) between Chicago and Los Angeles.  In 1959 SP standardized on a paint scheme of dark grey with a red "winged" nose; this scheme was dubbed ''Bloody Nose'' by railfans. Lettering was again in white. During the failed [[Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad]] merger in the mid 1980s, the "Kodachrome" (Named after Kodak's film strip box colors of the day.) paint scheme was applied to many Southern Pacific locomotives.  When the Southern Pacific Santa Fe merger was denied by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], the  Kodachrome units were not when it came to paint, some even lasted up to the days of Sounthern Pacific's end as an independent company.  The [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]'s decision left Southern Pacific in a decrepit state, the locomotives where not repainted immediately, although some were repainted into the ''Bloody Nose'' scheme as they were overhauled after months to years of deffered maintenance.  After the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]], owner Philip Anschutz purchased the Southern Pacific in 1988, the side lettering became often done in the Rio Grande "speed lettering" style.  The Rio Grande did not retain its identity, the Southern Pacific was the dominant road in the purchase.

Southern Pacific road switcher diesels were well-known by [[railfan]]s for several distinct features beyond their paint schemes.  The units often featured elaborate lighting clusters, both front and rear, which featured a large red [[Mars Light]] for emergency signaling, and often two sets of twin sealed-beam headlamps, one on top of the cab between the number boards, and the other below the Mars Light on the locomotive's nose.  The Southern Pacific, starting in the 1970s, employed cab air conditioning on all new locomotives, and the air conditioning unit on top of the locomotive cab is quite visible.  The Southern Pacific also placed very large snowplows on the pilots of their road switchers, primarily for the heavy winter snowfall encountered on the [[Donner Pass]] route.  Many Southern Pacific road switchers used a Nathan 5-chime [[train horn|air horn]], which formed a chord that was unique to the Southern Pacific locomotives.

The Southern Pacific, and its subsidiary [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt]], were the only operators of the [[EMD SD45T-2]] "Tunnel Motor" locomotive. This locomotive was necessary because the standard configuration [[EMD SD45]] could not get a sufficient amount of cool air into the diesel locomotive's radiatior while working Southern Pacific's extensive snow shed and tunnel system in the Cascades and Donner Pass.  These "Tunnel Motors" were essentially EMD SD45s with radiator air intakes located at the locomotive carbody's walkway level, rather than EMD's typical radiator setup with fans on the locomotive's long hood roof blowing fresh air downwards through the radiator.  Inside tunnels and snowsheds, the hot exhaust gases from lead units would accumulate near the top of the tunnel or snowshed, and be drawn into the radiators of trailing EMD (non-tunnel motor) locomotives, leading these locomotives to shut down as their diesel prime mover overheated.  The Southern Pacific also operated [[EMD SD40T-2]]s, as did the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]].

Unlike many other railroads, whose locomotive numberboards bore the locomotive's number, the SP used them for the train number all the way up to the proposed [[Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad]] merger. By the [[Rio Grande Industries]] era, SP had adopted the more standard practice of using the number boards for the road number.

Toward the end of the railroad's corporate life, Southern Pacific locomotives were known for being very dirty.  Some [[railfan]]s jokingly observed that the railroad's heavily used locomotives were only washed when it rained.

Union Pacific recently unveiled [[UP 1996]], the sixth and final of its Heritage Series [[EMD SD70ACe]] locomotives. Its paint scheme appears to be based on the Daylight and Black Widow schemes.

==Ferry service==
[[Image:CHS.J1211.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Southern Pacific Company's ''Bay City'' [[ferry]] plies the waters of [[San Francisco Bay]] in the late 19th century.]]
The Central Pacific Railroad (and later the Southern Pacific) maintained and operated a [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|fleet of ferry boats]] that connected Oakland with San Francisco by water.  For this purpose, a massive pier, the [[Oakland Long Wharf]], was built out into San Francsico Bay in the 1870s which served both local and mainline passengers.  Early on, the Central Pacific gained control of the existing ferry lines for the purpose of linking the northern rail lines with those from the south and east; during the late 1860s the company purchased nearly every bayside plot in Oakland, creating what author and historian [[Oscar Lewis]] described as a "wall around the waterfront" that put the townâs fate squarely in the hands of the corporation. Competitors for ferry passengers or dock space were ruthlessly run out of business, and not even stage coach lines could escape the group's notice, or wrath.

By 1930, the Southern Pacific owned the world's largest ferry fleet (which was subsidized by other railroad activities), carrying 40 million passengers and 60 million vehicles annually aboard 43 vessels.  However, the opening of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]] in 1936 initiated the slow decline in demand for ferry service, and by 1951 only 6 ships remained active.  SP ferry service was discontinued altogether in 1958.
