'''Boy Scouts''' are one of the traditional membership divisions of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA), available to boys 10&ndash;17.  It is the oldest division of the three Scouting programs ([[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]], Boy Scouts, and [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]) from the BSA.  The program uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities among youth.

The program had an estimated registration of 61,495 in 1911<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.boyscoutstuff.com/timeline.html | title =Boy Scouting in America: The First Decade | format = | work =A Virtual Boy Scout Museum | publisher = | accessdate =March 28 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>. As of the end of 2004, the Boy Scout program was serving 922,323 Boy Scouts with 543,487 troop level leaders in 43,984 troops.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/media/review/2004.html | title =Year in Review: 2004 | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> 

==Ideals==
The Boy Scout ideals are spelled out in the Scout Law, the Scout Oath, the Scout Motto and the Scout Slogan.  Each Scout learns to use these ideals as a measure of personal growth.

;The Scout Law
:A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.

;The Scout Oath
:On my honor I will do my best
:to do my duty to God and my country
:and to obey the Scout Law;
:to help other people at all times;
:to keep myself physically strong,
:mentally awake, and morally straight.

;The Scout Motto
:Be Prepared.

;The Scout Slogan
:Do a Good Turn Daily.

The Scout Sign identifies the youth as a Boy Scout and is used when giving the Scout Law or the Scout Oath.  The [[Three-finger salute (scouts)|Scout Salute]] is used when saluting the [[flag of the United States]]. The left-handed [[handshake]] is used as a token of [[friendship]] and identity.

;Emblems
The rank advancements use a series of medals and patches emblematic of the Scouting program.  The basic Scout badge uses the [[fleur-de-lis]], symbolizing a [[compass]] needle, pointing the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward.  The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield.  The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend that freedom.  The Second Class badge has a scroll with the ends turned up and inscribed with the Scout Motto, and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom: the knot is a reminder for each Scout to remember the Scout slogan and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service.  The First Class badge combines the elements of the Scout, Tenderfoot and Second Class badges.

==History==
===Establishment===
:{{details|Boy Scouts of America#History}}

===Early history===
The first program for Scouts with disabilities was introduced in 1923.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.ppbsa.org/mem/memwb29.htm | title =Scouts with Special Needs | format = | work = | publisher =Patriots’ Path Council, Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =March 20 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>

===1972&ndash;1979: The Improved Scouting Program===
September of 1972 saw the launch of the Improved Scouting Program.  The use of ''boy'' was de-emphasized:  the eighth edition of the handbook was titled ''Scout Handbook'' and the new strategic logo used ''Scouting/USA''.  Much of the [[Scoutcraft]] information and requirements were removed, replaced by information on drug abuse, family finances, child care and community problems.  Conservation included both urban and wilderness areas.  The concept of the personal growth agreement conferences was introduced as a requirement for each rank.  Under the new program, a Scout could reach First Class without going hiking or camping or cooking over a fire.  The program was modified for a system of ''immediate recognition''.  Individual rank requirements were replaced by skill awards recognized by metal belt loops.  Ranks and merit badges were to be presented immediately, and recognized later at the [[court of honor]].  The merit badge program&mdash; previously only available to First Class and above&mdash;was opened to all ranks, and merit badges were required for Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class.  The number of required merit badges for Eagle Scout was increased to 24, and Camping merit badge was dropped from the required list.  The entry age  was changed to 11 or 10-½ if a boy had finished fifth grade.  Most of the uniform patches and emblems were changed to multi-color versions.  

The Senior Boy Scout program was replaced by the Leadership Corps.  Initially the Leadership Corps was limited to leaders 14&ndash;15; older boys were expected to become junior assistant Scoutmasters or move to Exploring.  The Leadership Corps could wear the forest green shirt with a Scout BSA strip until it was discontinued in 1979.  The Leadership Corps patch was worn in place of the patrol patch, The first version of the patch was trapezoidal, replaced by a round patch in 1987.  The red beret was initially introduced for the Leadership Corps, and extended for troop wear in 1973.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first =Michael R. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Falls/8826/leadershipcorps.html | title = Leadership Corps (1972-89) | format =  | work = A History of Senior Scouting Programs in the BSA | publisher =  | accessdate = 7 March | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  The Troop Leader Development (TLD) program was introduced in 1974 to train youth leaders.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.pinetreeweb.com/TLD-1974.htm | title =Historical Background of Leadership Development: Troop Leader Development, 1974 | format = | work = | publisher =The Pine Tree Web | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>The Cornerstone program was introduced to train adult leaders.  Leaders who completed the course were recognized by a special version of the leader's emblem that was embroidered with mylar thread, giving a shiny look.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.mninter.net/~blkeagle/trained.htm | title =Trained | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = | accessyear = }}</ref>
 
In 1976, concerns over the lack of emphasis on Scoutcraft and declining membership lead to the introduction of "All Out for Scouting", a back-to-basics program developed by [[William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]].  The program was launched with "Brownsea Double-Two", a week long course for the senior patrol leader who would then introduce the troop-level "Operation Flying Start" to their units.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.pinetreeweb.com/brownsea.htm | title =Historical Background of Leadership Development: Brownsea Double-Two, 1976 | format = | work = | publisher =The Pine Tree Web | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>  Junior Leader Training (JLT) replaced TLD and Brownsea Double-Two in 1979.  From a peak of 6.5 million Scouts in 1972, membership declined to a low of 4.3 million in 1980.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.troop97.net/t97hist2.htm | title =BSA: the 1970s | format = | work = | publisher =Troop 97 | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>

Hillcourt returned from retirement to write the ninth edition of the [[Boy Scout Handbook]] in 1979, returning much of the Scoutcraft skills.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.troop97.net/bshb1.htm | title =9th Edition—Official Boy Scout Handbook (1979-1990) | format = | work =The Boy Scout Handbook: 1910-Today | publisher =Troop 97 | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>  The number of Eagle required merit badges was reduced back to 21, and Camping was restored to the required list.

===1979 to present===
In 1980, the new [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]] was introduced.  The [[Varsity Scouts]] program was introduced in 1984 as an alternate program for older boys.  In 1989, some of the last elements of the Improved Scout Program ended when the skill award program was discontinued and the individual requirements were returned to the ranks.  The Leadership Corps program was eliminated.

Also in 1989, the Venture crew and Varsity team programs for older boys 14&ndash;17 within the troop were introduced.  Initially, girls were allowed to participate in team and crew activities, but this was later quitely dropped.  These programs used the Venture/Varsity Letter with activity pins for recognition.  The Varsity team program within the troop was discontinued in 1996.  When the [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] program was introduced in 1998, Venture crews were redesignated as Venture patrols.  In early 2005, the BSA quietly stopped allowing Venture Patrols to use the Venture/Varsity Letter and activity pins, restricting them to just [[Varsity Scouts]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2005 | url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0509/d-lett.html | title =Confused about Venture patrols | format = | work =Scouting magazine | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = | accessyear = }}</ref>Initially, the youth leaders were the Venture crew chief and assistant crew chief and the Varsity team captain and team co-captain.  The adult leaders were the assistant Scoutmaster Venture and the assistant Scoutmaster Varsity.  All of these positions and the emblems were eliminated except for assistant Scoutmaster Venture.

==Organization==
===Troop===
The Boy Scout troop is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartering organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the troop, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

The troop committee is a group of adults, led by the committee chair, who plan the troop program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration.

The troop generally meets weekly providing a pre-planned program. It is led by youths who are elected as Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader (ASPL). The SPL and ASPL are guided by a Scoutmaster and the assistant Scoutmasters. The Scoutmaster must be at least 21 and is directly responsible for training and guiding the boy leaders, working with other adults to bring Scouting to boys, and for using the methods of Scouting to achieve the aims of Scouting.

The troop is divided into patrols of eight to ten Scouts, led by an elected patrol leader and assistant patrol leader.  Other youth positions of responsibility include: troop guide, Order of the Arrow troop representative, den chief, scribe, librarian, historian, quartermaster, bugler, junior assistant Scoutmaster, chaplain aide and instructor.

===Lone Scout===
[[Image:LoneScoutLogo.gif|right|75px]]
The Lone Scout program serves boys who cannot take part in a nearby troop on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or similar issues. While the boy does not participate in troop or patrol activities, he does learn the fun, values, and achievements of Scouting.<ref>{{cite web | author =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-515.html | title = BSA Fact Sheet: What Is the Lone Scout Plan? | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 7 February | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Venture patrol===
[[Image:venturestrip.jpg|right|75px]]
:''The Venture patrol should not be confused with [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]], the program for young men and women ages 14&ndash;21.''
The '''Venture''' patrol is an optional program for Boy Scout troops of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) for boys 13&ndash;17.  The program is geared towards the needs of older boys who are looking for expanded social contact and physical challenges.  The program is based on high adventure or sports activities.  The patrol is led by an elected patrol leader and assistant patrol leader  The patrol is guided by the assistant Scoutmaster-Venture who is resposible to the Scoutmaster for Venture patrol activities.  Venture patrol members wear the standard [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]] with the Venture strip over the right pocket.  Patrol members are Boy Scouts and should never be referred to as Venture Scouts.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/identity/los/los.jsp?typ=los&how=alfa&wat=V | title = Scouting Terms and Style| format = | work =The Language of Scouting | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>

===Varsity Scouts===
[[Image:BSA Varsity logo.png|right|75px]]
:{{main|Varsity Scouts}}
'''Varsity Scouts''' are part of the Boy Scout program division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).  It is an alternative program available to boys from 14&ndash;17 that takes the basic Boy Scout program and adds high adventure and sporting activities to be more appealing to older youth.  Varsity Scouts are organized into teams, which are separate chartered units from a Boy Scout troop.

===Order of the Arrow===
[[Image:OA-logo.jpg|right|75px|The OA Logo]]
:{{main|Order of the Arrow}}
The '''Order of the Arrow''' ('''OA''') is a program of the Boy Scout division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).  It is the BSA's national [[honor society]] for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service.

==Uniform==
The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]] is worn by Scouts and adult leaders.  The official cap is olive green with a red front panel and a Scout emblem.  The troop may may also choose the [[campaign hat]], but today these are seen mostly in historical troops (i.e. pre-[[World War II]]), and by leaders in a training course.  Many troops elect to create custom caps.

A variety of official neckerchiefs are available or the troop can create their own design.  Many troops now opt not to wear a neckerchief.  Special neckerchiefs such as [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] or [[Wood Badge]] are generally worn on formal occasions.

Insignia such as sashes, medals, and pins are generally only worn only on formal occasions.

The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Scouter dress uniform|Scouter dress uniform]] is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.

The advancement program for Boy Scouts has two phases.  The first phase of Scout to First Class is designed to teach the boy [[Scoutcraft]] skills , how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance.  Scout is the joining rank, and is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank1.html | title =Boy Scout Joining Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>  Tenderfoot<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank2.html | title =Tenderfoot Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>, Second Class<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank3.html | title =Second Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> and First Class<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank4.html | title =First Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> have progessively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and [[Scout Spirit]].  Scouts with a permanent mental or physical disability may use alternate requirements, based on the Scout's abilities, and approved by the council.

Although Eagle is the highest rank and one all Scouts should strive for, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness. Studies have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in the Scout program for at least three years. Scouts who do so are more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of "producing useful citizens".

The second phase of Star<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank5.html | title =Star Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>, Life<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank6.html | title =Life Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> and Eagle is designed to develop leadership skills and allow the Scout to explore potential vocations and avocations through the [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badge]] program.  The Star and Life ranks require that the boy serve in a position of responsibility and perform [[community service]].

:{{details|Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle}}
The Eagle Scout rank likewise requires a position of responsibility, as well as a community service project planned and led entirely by the Eagle Scout candidate and the earning of a series of merit badges.  After attaining the rank of Eagle, a Scout may earn Eagle Palms for additonal tenure and merit badges.

Several programs of [[List of BSA religious emblems|religious awards]] are administered by various religious institutions and recognized by the BSA.  These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot.  Many other [[Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America|advancement and recognitions]]&mdash;such as the [[50-miler award]], Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award &mdash;are available to Scouts who show performance in special areas.

===Leader recognition===
Boy Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Scouters Training Award is available to any leader, while the Scouter's Key and Scoutmaster Award of Merit are only available to the Scoutmaster.

==Program and activities==
Scout activities are conducted at the discretion of the troop, but all troops' programs have some similarities.

Troops typically hold meetings once a week, though some do not meet during the summer. The activities conducted at troop meetings vary widely, from Scout skills training to [[camping (recreation)|camping]] trip planning to [[game]]s.  Patrol meetings independent of troop meetings may be held to conduct patrol business, such as the creation of a patrol [[flag]]. Most patrols do not hold regular meetings independent of troop meetings, but some go so far as to organize their own outings. Patrol activities are planned by the patrol leader.

Troops also typically hold excursions once a month or more; such as [[camping (recreation)|camping]] trips. These outings are an important place for Scouts to work on skills and rank advancement, have fun, and be engaged in productive outdoor activities. Other common outings include [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[canoeing]], and [[hiking]] trips. Less common excursions include [[rafting]], [[climbing]], [[spelunking]], and [[abseil|rappelling]].

Most councils own and operate one or more permanent camps. These camps host a variety of activities throughout the year, but are most heavily used during the summer. Summertime encampments are one week long. Summer camps are important places for the earning of merit badges, particularly those that require special facilities, such as [[archery]] and participating in high adventure activities. Purely recreational activities are also available, and most camps offer day-long overnight side trips. Troops may choose to attend the summer camp operated by their own council or one belonging to another council.

It is common for several troops within a district or council to gather at least once a year at a special weekend campout called a [[camporee]]. A camporee is a district or council-wide event where several units camp and engage in activities, competitions, and learn specialized skills, such as [[knot]] tying, [[flagpole]] raising and [[flag]] ceremony, and [[orienteering]]. Troops place varying amounts of emphasis on preparing for camporees, and those that win the highest awards usually do so by making camporee their first priority.  Many camporees have a specific theme that is emphasized.

Some councils hold "jamborees" or "camporalls", which are similar to camporees, but occur less often and draw troops from a broader area.  Every four years (except between 2005 and 2010 to co-incide with the centennial of BSA) the National Council holds its [[National Scout Jamboree]]. Most recently, they have been held at [[Fort A.P. Hill]] in Virginia and draw more than 30,000 Scouts from across the United States.

==Training==
New leaders are encouraged to attend training for their position<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/18-390/ | title = Every Boy Deserves a Trained Leader | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 8 March | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. This training provides the essential information they need to provide a safe and successful quality program.

Fast Start Training<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url =http://olc.scouting.org/ | title = Boy Scout Leader Fast Start | format =  | work =BSA Online LEarning Center  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Boy Scout program.  Fast Start is self pace and provided as a video or online. Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and must be recertified per local council policy.

Basic Leader Training consists of New Leader Essentials, Scoutmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster Specific Training, and Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills. New Leader Essentials is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Boy Scouts of America. Scoutmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster Specific Training gives the Scoutmaster or assistant Scoutmaster the needed program knowledge.  Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills gives the adult leaders needed camping/outdoor skills and knowledge. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a "Trained" emblem for uniform wear.

Supplemental training modules<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/supplemental/index.html | title = Supplemental Training Modules | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 8 March | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a University of Scouting program offered by the local councils and at National Training Conferences held at the [[Philmont Training Center]] and the [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].

[[Wood Badge]] is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and woggle.

The Scoutmaster provides initial youth leader training within at the troop level.  Youth leaders are encouraged to attend [[National Youth Leadership Training]] at the district or council level.
