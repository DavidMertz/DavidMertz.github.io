'''Thena''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].

==History==
Originally born under the name Azura, but her father [[Zuras]] had her name changed to resemble that of [[Zeus]]' daughter [[Athena]] to seal the treaty between their two peoples. Due to this, she has often been mistaken for [[Athena]].  The city of [[Athens]] was apparently built for her, not the goddess, although Thena later allowed it to be conquered by the [[Spartans]] in 404 B.C.

Encountered [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] in [[Babylon]] 2,500 years ago. He had a chance to slay her, but did not; as the years passed, the two of them grew closer together. Thena and Kro made love during the [[Vietnam War]], resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with twins. She placed them inside of Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter|Donald and Deborah]].

When Kro led his armies in an attack on [[New York]], Thena opposed him. After Kro called a truce, he showed her [[Ransak the Reject]], a genetically stable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]]. Thena was convinced by the Deviant [[Karkas]] to grant both of them sanctuary. After Zuras' death & the subsequent departure of most of Earth's Eternals, Thena became [[Prime Eternal]], but she was traumatized by her father's death & was being subtly influenced by a Brain-Mine Kro had placed upon her. She turned against [[Ikaris]] to help save Kro's life,  but later relinquished her title to Ikaris.  When she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro, but has since forgiven him.

===The Eternals (2006)===
{{spoiler}}
In the 2006 Eternals title, Thena is married to Thomas Eliot, and is a researcher at Stark Enterprises.  Like Sersi and [[Makkari (comics) | Makkari]], she appears to have no memory of her past as an Eternal. The story is on-going.
