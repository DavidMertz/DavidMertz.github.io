In 1994 [[Ruud Janssen]] from the [[Netherlands]] started with his '''mail-interviews'''. He interviewed [[Fluxus]] and [[Mail-Art]] personalities by using all the communication-forms that were available (Fax, E-Mail, Envelope, Personal Meeting, Telephone Call). The question travelled by one form and the answer could be sent back in another form. This [[concept]] resulted in a series of mail-interviews. These interviews were published in booklet-form and the complete texts are also available online at [http://www.iuoma.org www.iuoma.org.] Additional mail art interviews, which were conducted via e-mail can be found at [http://www.art.net/kiyotei/flashlight/ kiyotei's den.]
