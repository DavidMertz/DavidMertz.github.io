'''Mohamad "Bob" Hasan''' (born 1941) is an [[Indonesia]]n businessman, former Minister of Trade and Industry, and friend of former [[president of Indonesia]] [[Suharto]].  Hasan was convicted of [[corruption]] in 2001 in a widely-publicised trial.

Hasan, who is of [[Indonesian Chinese]] descent and whose birth name is '''The Kian San''', was born in [[Semarang]] in February 1941. He is an adopted son of Gatot Subroto, a general in the [[Indonesian Army]], who commanded then-Colonel Suharto in the 1950s, and through whom Hasan met Suharto.  He dominated the Indonesian forestry, paper and milling industry, making him one of the country's most prominent businessmen.  Starting from forestry, he expanded his business interests into financial, insurance, automotive, and other industries, mostly through his holding company Kiani Kertas.<ref name="saragosa">Saragosa, Manuel (1997).

Suharto appointed Hasan Minister of Trade and Industry in 1998, making him the only Indonesian of Chinese descent ever to join Suharto's cabinet.  His appointment was criticised by some foreign financial analysts as evidence that Suharto was not interested in substantial fiscal changes after the [[East Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] began in 1997.<ref>Porter, Barry (1998).

Long the subject of allegations of corruption, he was convicted in February 2001, after Suharto stepped down. The court unanimously convicted him of causing a US$244 million loss to the Indonesian government through a fraudulent forest-mapping project in Java in the early 1990s. Hasan was the first and among the most prominent of former Suharto associates convicted of fraud and corruption after Suharto resigned in May 1998.  He was imprisoned on [[Nusa Kambangan]], an island off the coast of south-central Java, until his release on [[parole]] in February 2004. <ref>Donnan, Shawn (2004).

Hasan was a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] from 1994 to 2004, when the IOC expelled him due to his corruption conviction.  The IOC was criticised by the Indonesian government in 2000 after the IOC argued that Hasan should be allowed to attend the [[2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Australia despite his being under arrest at the time.<ref>Bita, Natasha (2000).
