'''Anthesis''' is the period during which a [[flower]] is fully open and functional. It may also refer to the onset of that period.

The onset of anthesis is spectacular in some species. In ''[[Banksia]]'' species, for example, anthesis involves the release of the [[carpel|style]] end from the upper [[perianth]] parts. Anthesis of flowers is sequential within an [[inflorescence]], so when the style and perianth are different colours, the result is a striking colour change that gradually sweeps along the inflorescence.
