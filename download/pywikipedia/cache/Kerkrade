== History ==
The history of Kerkrade is closely linked with that of the adjacent town of [[Herzogenrath]], just across the German border<ref>Stenvert, R. et al. (2003). ''Monumenten in Nederland: Limburg'', p. 173&ndash;178. Zwolle: Waanders Uitgevers. ISBN 90-400-9623-6.</ref>. Herzogenrath began as a settlement, called Rode, near the river [[Wurm|Worm]] (or Wurm in German) in the 11th century. In 1104 [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monks founded an abbey, called or Kloosterrade, to the west of this settlement.

It was called '' 's-Hertogenrode'' or '' 's-Hertogenrade'' (Dutch: ''the Duke's Rode'') after the [[duchy of Brabant]] took controle over the region; in French it was called ''Rolduc (Rode-le-duc)''.  As is the case for many parts of the [[Southern Netherlands]], the place changed hands several times in the last few centuries. It was under [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish]] control from 1661, [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian]] between 1713 and 1785 and [[French Revolution|French]] between 1795 and 1813. In [[1815]], when the kingdom of the Netherlands was formed (see [[Vienna Congress]]), the border was drawn through Herzogenrath, the western part being Kerkrade.

In the 18th century the monks of Rolduc began small-scale [[coal mining|coal mines]]. More modern exploitation by others started in 1860, causing Kerkrade to grow significantly. When the Willem Sophia mine was opened around 1900, the town grew even more rapidly, absorbing old villages like Chèvremont. In the decades following 1960, all the mines in Limburg were closed.

One of the oldest buildings in the municipality is Oud Ehrenstein, a castle the origins of which lie in the 14th century.

== Nieuwstraat ==

One part of the border between the Netherlands and Germany runs along the middle of the street Nieuwstraat/Neustraße.  Because of relatively unrestricted cross-border travel within the European Union, this border was for many years marked only with a low wall, about 30cm high, running along the length of the street.  There was a separate 2-way road on each side, and cars had to pass through the official crossing points, but pedestrians could readily step over the wall (although there were signs informing of the border).  In 1991, it was decided to remove the wall completely.  Nieuwstraat/Neustraße is now a single two-way road, with the extra space now occupied with trees and bicycle lanes.  The border is unmarked, and is crossed even when going round a roundabout or overtaking a vehicle.  (See [[Schengen treaty]].)

== Transportation ==
[[Train station]]s: Kerkrade Centrum (krd), Chevremont (cvm), Eygelshoven (egh).

== Miscellaneous information ==
The building of a dam in the Anstel, a brook flowing west of Kerkrade, has led to the formation of a reservoir with an area of about 20 ha. This and its surroundings are very rich in flora and fauna.

Kerkrade is the home of the soccer club [[Roda JC (Kerkrade)|Roda JC]].
