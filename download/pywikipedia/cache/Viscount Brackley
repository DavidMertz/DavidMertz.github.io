The title '''Viscount Brackley''' has been created twice; once in the [[Peerage of England]] and once in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].  The English title was created in [[1616]] for [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton, 1st Baron Ellesmere]] however he died a year later and the viscountcy merged with the [[Earl of Bridgewater|earldom of Bridgewater]], which had been meant for Egerton but he died before he could receive it.  Egerton's son [[John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater|John Egerton]] thus became the 1st Earl of Bridgewater.

It was later created in the UK in [[1846]] as a subsidiary title of the [[Earl of Ellesmere|earldom of Ellesmere]], which is held by the [[Duke of Sutherland]].
