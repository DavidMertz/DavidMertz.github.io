The '''Tairua River''' is located on the [[Coromandel Peninsula]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. 

It flows north and then northeast for a total of 35 kilometres from its source in the [[Coromandel Range]] to the west of [[Whangamata]], passing through the town of [[Hikuai]] before reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[Tairua]] on the peninsula's east coast. 

The small [[Shoe Island]] lies directly opposite the river's mouth, two kilometres into the Pacific.
