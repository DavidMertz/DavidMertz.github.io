'''Cape Howe''' ({{coor dm|37|30|S|149|58|E}}<ref>[http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/gazd01?rec=245241 Cape Howe page] at [[Geoscience Australia]]</ref>) is a coastal headland in [[Australia]], forming the border of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

It lies within the [[Nadgee Nature Reserve]] on the NSW side, and the [[Croajingolong National Park]] on the Victorian side.  The seas around the point are the [[Cape Howe Marine National Park]].

The point was named by [[Captain Cook]] when he passed it on [[20 April]] [[1770]], honouring [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe]] who was [[Treasurer of the Navy]] at that time.  The coordinates Cook gave ({{coor dm|37|28|S|210|3|W}}) are almost exactly the modern surveyed location.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=8106|name=Captain Cook's Journal During the First Voyage Round the World}}</ref>
