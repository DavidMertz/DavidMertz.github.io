'''Rosemary Glancy''' (1953 - January 12, 2001) was a [[Providence, Rhode Island]] city employee for 26 1/2 years. Indicted on charges of attempted [[extortion]], [[conspiracy]] and [[mail fraud]], Glancy was the first [[Operation Plunder Dome]] defendant to go to trial. She was convicted on seven counts. The judge ordered her to pay $25,000 in restitution and sentenced her to 33 months in prison, which she began serving at a federal facility in [[Danbury, CT]].

After Glancy became terminally ill with kidney and liver failure, she was taken to a [[Texas]] prison hospital for treatment. The judge reduced her sentence to time served and granted a compassionate release to her family's care.

In an interview with The Providence Journal after her release, Glancy said of City Hall, "The greedy got richer and the poor people got screwed."

"I got the shaft ... If you're not on the A Team, you're a nothing," she said.

Glancy died Jan. 12, 2001, at Massachusetts General Hospital in [[Boston]]. She was 48 years old.
