The '''Palmiet Pumped Storage Scheme''' consists of two 200MW units located 2km upstream of the Kogelberg Dam wall on the [[Palmiet River]]. It is regarded as a forerunner in [[environmental engineering]].  The whole Palmiet site is a conservation area and in December [[1998]] the area was declared a [[Biosphere Reserve]] by [[UNESCO]] - the first in [[South Africa]].
