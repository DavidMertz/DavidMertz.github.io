'''Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Алексей Петрович Ермолов), or '''Ermolov''' ([[June 4]] n.s. (<small>[[May 24]] o.s.</small>) [[1777]] - [[April 23]] n.s. (<small>[[April 11]] o.s.</small>) [[1861]]), was the premier [[Russia]]n military hero during the golden age of Russian [[Romanticism]]. His [[charisma]]tic leadership of imperial armies was praised in the poems by [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], and others.

Yermolov was born in [[Moscow]] in an officer's family. He studied at the school of the [[Moscow University]] and entered the army in [[1791]]. After seeing some service under [[Alexander Suvorov]] in the [[Kosciuszko Uprising|Polish campaign of 1794]] and under [[Valerian Zubov]] in the [[Persian Expedition of 1796|War with Persia]] (1796), he was accused of [[freethought|freethinking]] views and exiled to [[Kostroma]] in 1798.

After the assassination of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] in 1801, the new emperor, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], pardoned Yermolov, who returned to the military and began studying the works of Suvorov, whose disciple he now considered himself. His own military genius blossomed during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. During [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], he distinguished himself at [[Battle of Valutino|Valutino]], [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets|Maloyaroslavets]], and especially at [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. His astonishing prowess won him the admiration of the commander-in-chief, Prince [[Kutuzov]], on whose recommendation he was appointed to command the general staff of the united armies. During the European campaigns of [[1813]] and [[1814]], Yermolov was in charge of the [[artillery]] corps of the allies. His able command proved crucial to their success in the [[Battle of Kulm]].

Since 1816, Yermolov (by that time promoted to the rank of full artillery general) was responsible for [[Caucasian War|Russian military policies in Caucasus]]. For ten years he was both commander-in-chief of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n armies and the imperial ambassador in [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. His freedom-loving character would often lead him to conflicts with the Ministry of War. But he was adored by his soldiers and generally successful in his subjugation of highlanders of [[Dagestan]]. His career came to an abrupt end when he was held responsible for Russia's initial setbacks during the [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828]] and replaced with [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s favorite [[Ivan Paskevich]].<ref>Frederick W. Kagan. ''The Military Reforms of Nicholas I: The Origins of the Modern Russian Army'', Palgrave, 1999, ISBN 0-312-21928-8, p.291.</ref>

During the last 30 years of his life, Yermolov lived in seclusion at his manor near [[Orel]]. He was asked to lead a peasant [[militia]] during the [[Crimean War]] but declined on account of poor health. He died on [[April 11]] (o.s.)/[[April 23]] (n.s.), [[1861]] in Moscow and was buried in Orel. Yermolov's [[memoirs]] were published posthumously in two volumes.

ERMOLOV (Yermolov), Aleksey Petrovich (b. 4 June 1772, Moscow &ndash; 23 April 1861, Moscow) was born a Russian noble family from the [[Orlov]] gubernia. He graduated from the boarding school of the [[Moscow University]] and enlisted in the Life Guard Preobrazhensk Regiment on 16 January 1787. Four years later, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and transferred to the Nizhegorod Dragoon Regiment with the rank of [[captain]]. He briefly taught at the Artillery and Engineer Cadet Corps in 1793 before being sent to fight the [[Polish]] insurgents in 1794. He participated in the assault on [[Praga]] and received the [[Order of St. George]] (4th class) on 12 January 1795. The next year, Ermolov took part in the [[Persian]] Campaign along the [[Caspian Sea]]. However, he was arrested on 7 January 1799 for alleged participation in [[conspiracy]] against the [[Tsar]] and Ermolov spent two years in [[exile]]. He was restored under [[Alexander I]] and appointed to the 8th Artillery Regiment on 13 May 1801; he then transferred to the horse artillery company on 21 June 1801. 

During the 1805 Campaign, Ermolov served in the rear and advance guards and distinguished himself at [[Amstetten]] and [[Austerlitz]]. For his actions, he was promoted to [[colonel]] on 16 July 1806. The following year, he participated in the campaign in [[Poland]], serving in Prince Bagration's advance guard. He distinguished himself commanding an artillery company in numerous rearguard actions during the retreat to [[Landsberg]] as well as in the [[Battle of Eylau]]. In June 1807, Ermolov commanded horse artillery company in the actions at [[Guttstadt]], [[Deppen]], [[Heilsberg]] and [[Friedland]], garnering the [[Order of St. George]] (3rd class, 7 September 1807). He was promoted to [[major general]] on 28 March 1808 and was appointed inspector of horse artillery companies. In early 1809, he inspected artillery companies of the Army of [[Danube]]. Although his division took part in the 1809 Campaign against A[[ustria]], Ermolov commanded the reserves in [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolsk]] gubernias where he remained for the next two years. In 1811, he took command of the guard artillery company and in 1812, became the [[Chief of Staff]] of the 1st Western Army. 

During the [[1812]] Campaign, Ermolov took part in the retreat to [[Smolensk]] and played an important role in the quarrel between Generals Barclay de Tolly and Bagration. He opposed Barclay’s strategy and appealed to Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] to replace him with Bagration. After the Russian armies united on 2 August, Ermolov fought at Smolensk and Lubino (Valutina Gora) for which he was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] on 12 November 1812 with seniority dating from 16 August 1812. He distinguished himself at [[Borodino]], where he was lightly wounded leading a counterattack that recaptured the Great Redoubt. For his courage, Ermolov received the [[Order of St. Anna]] (1st class). During the rest of campaign, he served as a duty officer in the headquarters of the main Russian army and fought at Maloyaroslavets. 

In October-November 1812, Ermolov served in the advance guard under Miloradovich and fought at Vyazma and Krasnyi. In late November, he commanded one of the detachments in the advance guard under General Rosen taking part in the combats on the Berezina. On 3 December 1812, he was recalled to the main headquarters where he became the [[Chief of Staff]] of the Russian army. Three weeks later, he was appointed commander of the artillery of the Russian armies. 

In 1813, Ermolov fought at [[Lutzen]], where he was accused of insubordination and transferred to command the 2nd Guard Division. He then fought at Bautzen, commanding the Russian rearguard during the retreat, and at [[Kulm]] where he was decorated with the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Iron Cross]]. In 1814, he distinguished himself in the battle around Paris and was awarded the [[Order of St. George]] on 7 April 1814. Two years later, Ermolov was appointed as [[commander-in-chief]] of the Russian forces in Georgia and commander of the Independent Georgian Corps on 21 April 1816. He proved himself an able administrator and successfully negotiated with Persia in 1818, receiving promotion to general of infantry on 4 March 1818 (Ermolov was in retirement in 1827-1831 so his seniority was changed to 1 February 1822). 

Ermolov served in Georgia for nine years but was dismissed on 9 April 1827 because of his argument with General [[Ivan Paskevich]], who was patronized by Emperor [[Nicholas I]]; Ermolov was discharged on 7 December 1827 with a full pension. However, four years later, Emperor Nicholas restored him in the rank (6 November 1831) and appointed him to the State Council; Ermolov’s rank of [[general]] of infantry was confirmed in 1833. During the [[Crimean War]], Ermolov was elected the head of the Moscow opolchenye on 10 March 1855. He died on 23 April 1861 in Moscow and was buried at the Trinity Church in [[Orel]]. In addition to the already mentioned decorations, Ermolov was also decorated with the Russian Orders of St. Andrew the First Called, of [[St. Vladimir]] (1st class), of Alexander of Neva, of the White Eagle, and of St. Anna (1st class); foreign orders received included the Prussian Orders of [[Order of the Red Eagle|the Red Eagle]] (1st class) and the [[Pour le Mérite]], the Austrian Order of Maria Theresa (3rd class), the [[Baden Order]] of Karl Friedrich, the Persian [[Order of the Lion and the Sun]], and two golden swords for courage (including one with diamonds). 

Ermolov was one of the best artillery officers in the Russian army. He proved his abilities throughout the Napoleonic Wars and later in the [[Caucasus]]. However, he was also shrewd and cunning courtier, who often intrigued against his superiors. Because of his enigmatic character, Ermolov was often described as the “Modern Sphinx.” He proved himself a ruthless ruler in the Caucasus and distinguished himself brutally suppressing [[Chechen people|Chechen]] uprisings. Ermolov left very interesting and valuable memoirs on his service in 1796-1816. His “Zapiski” are divided into three parts covering his early career, the [[Napoleonic wars]] and his service in the Caucasus.
