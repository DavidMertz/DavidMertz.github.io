'''Priest Maxi''' (also known as Father Maxi) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the popular adult [[cartoon]], [[South Park]]. He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]].



== Role in the story ==

Priest Maxi is a [[Catholic]] priest who serves as the mouthpiece for South Park's Christian community. He is a narrow-minded and [[intolerance|intolerant]] man who is convinced most people are going to be damned to [[Hell]], often for trivial offenses. In one episode he bluntly claimed that Timmy would go to Hell, since Timmy cannot [[confession|confess his sins]], as he cannot speak anything fluently.

He also seems to know very little about religion; once, when seeing Jesus, he exclaimed "Hey, it's that guy from the Public Access show!" However, considering that Jesus actually hosts a cable access show in South Park, this could be seen for irony purposes.


== Storylines ==

=== Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo ===

Priest Maxi, then unnamed, makes his first appearance. When it's announced that Jesus has been removed from the [[Christmas]] play: "If you're going to remove Jesus, remove Santa and Frosty!"

=== Cripple Fight ===

Priest Maxi claims he will be able to convert [[Big Gay Al]] to being straight but it is revealved he made a similar claim about a man called "Peterson" who Priest Maxi himself ended up having sex with.

=== Red Hot Catholic Love ===

Despite his character flaws, it was Priest Maxi who, in the episode [[Red Hot Catholic Love]], unearthed the massive [[political corruption|corruption]] behind the many church-related [[sexual assault]]s. He also forced the [[Catholic Church]] to stop letting [[priest]]s molest young boys, even though he performed [[fornication]] (with Clyde's mom) in a confession booth himself.

== Trivia ==

*Much like Principal Victoria, his inverted name is a reference to singer [[Maxi Priest]]
*Like many men in South Park, he is a great [[fan (aficionado)|fan]] of the [[Denver Broncos]] going as far as including a Broncos chant in his sermons.
*In [[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]] it is shown or at least implied that he has had sex with [[Liane Cartman|Mrs. Cartman]].
