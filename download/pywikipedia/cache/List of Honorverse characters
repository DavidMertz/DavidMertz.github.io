{{CompactTOCb}}

This is an attempt at a completely comprehensive list of all names of even minute characters in the [[Honor Harrington]] series and authoritative related works.  Characters are sorted by their last name.  Some are sorted by first name since their last name has not been found in the books (or does not appear).  Military characters are mentioned with the rank they had in the last novel on which they appeared.

Although efforts have been made to include all characters, there are still omissions.

Also, note that background information is missing for many names, and that many names occur more than once. (Sometimes there are simple duplicates, sometimes reused names)

[[Treecat]]s characters have been split of into [[list of treecats]].
