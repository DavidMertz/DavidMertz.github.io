'''Jak Lauren''' is a character in the [[Deathlands]] series of novels by [[James Axler]].  He is an [[albino]], and is distinguished in the books by his unusual syntax when speaking. He is a young man, probably in his late teens, and is an extremely capable hunter and warrior. His signature weapon is a leaf bladed knife, of which he has several, and often uses them as thrown weapons or for melee when guns are inappropriate.  He also carries a large .357 Magnum that can also fire .38 rounds. Of the main characters in the books he is the most pragmatic survivalist.

One of the many weapons in his arsenal is his coat, which has fragments of razor blades sewn into it. More than once in the series an opponent has grabbed '''Jak''' only to be cut by the coat. 

Jak was not in the first book in the series, [[Pilgimage to Hell]],  and was introduced later.

In the widely derided ''Deathlands: Homeward Bound'' movie from the [[Sci-Fi Channel]], his personality was altered to that of a "savage".
