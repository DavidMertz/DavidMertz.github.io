'''Klippel Feil Syndrome (KFS)''' is a rare disorder characterized by the [[congenital]] fusion of any 2 of the 7 [[cervical vertebrae]].  It is caused by a failure in the normal segmentation of the cervical vertebrae during the early weeks of fetal development. The most common signs of the disorder are short neck, low hairline at the back of the head, and restricted mobility of the upper spine.

Associated abnormalities may include [[scoliosis]], [[spina bifida]], anomalies of the kidneys and the ribs, [[cleft palate]], respiratory problems, and heart defects. KFS may also be associated with abnormalities of the head and face, skeleton, sex organs, muscles, brain and spinal cord, arms, legs, and fingers.

Treatment for KFS is symptomatic and may include surgery to relieve cervical or craniocervical instability  and constriction of the spinal cord, and to correct scoliosis. 

The prognosis for most individuals with KFS is good if the disorder is treated early and appropriately.  Activities that can injure the neck should be avoided.

The 18th Dynasty Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] is believed to have suffered from Klippel Feil syndrome.

There are a number of KFS email support groups on the internet for persons affected (and their family & friends), for example:
