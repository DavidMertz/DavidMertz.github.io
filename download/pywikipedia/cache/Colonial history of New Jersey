{{main|History of New Jersey}}
The '''colonial history of New Jersey''' began in 1609 with the discovery of [[Cape May]] by [[Sir Henry Hudson]]. In the 17th Century parts of what is now [[New Jersey]] were colonized by [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] settlers. In 1664 the entire area was seized by the [[Great Britain|British]] who maintained control until the [[New Jersey during the American Revolution|American Revolution]].

==New Netherland==

{{details|New Netherland}}
Much of New Jersey was claimed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] before the arrival of the [[Great Britain|British]]. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] consisted of parts of modern [[New York]] and New Jersey. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch policy required formal purchase of all land settled upon, and the first such purchase was of [[Manhattan]], by [[Peter Minuit]]. The last Dutch governor was [[Peter Stuyvesant]], who was unpopular with his subjects because he tried to restrict religious freedom: the [[Flushing Remonstrance of 1657]] objected to his ban on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] as an infringement on the residents as [[Christians]] and as Dutch citizens. Peter Stuyvesant used military coercion in order to accomplish some of his goals, which only made him less liked. At New Netherland's height, 6,000 inhabitants resided in the colony.

The first permanent town, established in New Netherland in 1660, was Bergen, now [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].

Captain [[Cornelius Jacobsen Mey]], a Dutch explorer, also explored the New Jersey and [[Delaware Bay]] area. Cape May was named after Mey, as well as [[Cape May, New Jersey]] and [[Cape May County]].

==New Sweden==
{{details|New Sweden}}
In addition, some of southwestern New Jersey was settled by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] by the mid-[[1600s]] <ref>[http://www.colonialswedes.org/History/History.html "A Brief History of New Sweden in America"], retrieved December 16, 2005.</ref>. [[New Sweden]], founded in 1638, rose and Lenape neighbors. Under last governor of New Sweden, [[Johan Rising]], the Swedes captured Fort Casimir (now [[New Castle, Delaware]]), which was close to Fort Christina but was on the western side of the Delaware River. After capturing the fort, it was named Fort Trinity by the Swedes. 

This action provoked a furious Governor Stuyvesant, who, in revenge, sent seven armed Dutch ships and 317 soldiers to the Delaware River the next summer. Realizing that the situation was hopeless, the vastly outnumbered Swedes immediately surrendered Fort Trinity, and Governor Rising surrendered Fort Christina two weeks later. In 1655, the Dutch completely took over these lands and annexed them to New Netherland.

[[Italy|Italian]] navigator [[John Cabot]] left [[England]] in 1498 to explore [[North America]], but never returned. The British later used Cabot's voyage as proof that England had claims to the North American lands. New Jersey's [[Cape May]] was discovered in 1609 by [[Sir Henry Hudson]] <ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/state/NJ-History.htm New Jersey History] by Susan Ditmire, ''American Local History Network'', December 6, 2005, retrieved December 9, 2005.</ref>, in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He passed through [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]] before arriving at the [[Hudson River]].

From the colony of New Netherland the Dutch interfered with Britain's [[transatlantic]] trade with its North American colonies. Insisting that [[John Cabot]] had been the first to discover North America, the British granted the land that now encompasses New Jersey to the [[Duke of York]], who ordered [[Colonel]] [[Richard Nicolls]] to take over the area. In September 1664, a British fleet under the command of Richard Nicolls sailed into what is now [[New York Harbor]] and seized the colony from the Dutch. The British received little resistance, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the Dutch governor, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] <ref>Stuyvesant's council took several measures concerning religion in New Netherland, heightening his unpopularity, and he was also known for being hot-tempered. He took advantage of military coercion in order to increase his own power, shown in an event with [[Van Slechtenhorst]]. Stuyvesant grew haughty in his treatment of his opponents and threatened to dissolve the council in response to an angry outbreak at a meeting of commissioners in September, 1650. [http://www.peterstuyvesant.org/ Peter Stuyvesant] StanKlos.com<sup>TM</sup> (2001), retrieved December 15, 2005.</ref>. After capturing the colony, Nicolls took the position of deputy-governor of [[New Amsterdam]] and the rest of New Netherland, guaranteeing colonists' property rights, laws of inheritance, and the enjoyment of [[religious freedom]]. New Netherland was renamed New Jersey (after the [[English Channel]] Island of [[Jersey]] at which [[Charles II of England]] was proclaimed king in 1649) and [[New Amsterdam]] was renamed [[New York City|New York]] (after the Duke of York).

Charles II gave the region between [[New England]] and [[Maryland]] to his brother, the Duke of York (later [[James II of England|King James II]]), as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony). Later James granted the land between the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Delaware River]] that would become New Jersey to two friends who had been loyal to him through the [[English Civil War]]: Sir [[George Carteret]] and [[William Berkeley|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]].  

The two proprietors of New Jersey attempted to entice more settlers to move to New Jersey by granting sections of lands to settlers and by passing [[Concession and Agreement]], a document granting religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; under the British [[Church of England]] there was no such religious freedom. In return for land, settlers paid annual fees known as quitrents. [[Philip Carteret (Governor)|Philip Carteret]] was appointed by the two proprietors as the first governor of New Jersey. Philip Carteret designated [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabethtown]] as the first capital of the colony<ref>[[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] was not named after [[Queen Elizabeth I]], but rather after the wife of Sir [[George Carteret]], and was founded in 1664.</ref>. However, it became difficult for the two proprietors to collect the quitrents. As a result, on [[March 18]], [[1673]] Berkeley sold his share of New Jersey to the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]]. <ref>Streissguth, Thomas (2002). New Jersey.

{{details|Border between West Jersey and East Jersey}}
With this sale, New Jersey was divided into [[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]]. The exact border between West and East Jersey was often disputed, but generally corresponded to the border dividing present day [[South Jersey|South]] and [[North Jersey]]. The border between the two sides reached the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the north of Atlantic City. The [[Keith line|border line]] was created by [[George Keith]], and can still be seen in the county boundaries between [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington]] and [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean]] Counties, and between [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon]] and [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]] Counties, reaching upward to a point on the Delaware River which is just north of the [[Delaware Water Gap]]. The border was often disputed, so with the 1676 Quintipartite Deed more accurate surveys and maps were made to resolve property disputes. This resulted in the Thornton line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes.

On [[April 15]], [[1702]], under the reign of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], West and East Jersey were reunited as a royal colony. [[Edward Hyde]], Lord Cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of [[New York]], but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. [[Lewis Morris (1671-1746)|Judge Lewis Morris]] led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1738<ref>Streissguth pg 30-36</ref>.
{{details|New York-New Jersey Line War}}
The East Jersey/West Jersey border was not the only one in dispute. Beginning in 1701, New Jersey's border with [[New York]] was in dispute, resulting in a series of skirmishes and raids. In the largest of these squabbles some 210,000 acres (849.8 km²) of land were at stake between New York and New Jersey. The conflict was eventually settled by a royal commission in 1769.

In 1746 ''The College of New Jersey'' (now [[Princeton University]]) was founded in Elizabethtown by a group of [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] "New Lighters" that included [[Jonathan Dickinson (of New Jersey)|Jonathan Dickinson]], [[Aaron Burr, Sr.]] and [[Peter Van Brugh Livingston]]. In 1756 the school moved to Princeton.

==Life in Colonial New Jersey==

Many of the colonists of New Jersey took up the occupation as farmers. However, despite the fertility of the soil, farmers were forced to struggle due to the dearth of English money. Some farmers had [[slavery|slaves]] work for them, and others owned [[indentured servant]]s that had to work to pay back debts. 

Transportation was difficult. Usually, people walked by foot or traveled on horseback.

The majority of the colonists lived in simple log cabins. The idea of the log cabin came from the Dutch, the original settlers. Since New Jersey was ideally located next to the coast, colonists farmed, fished, and traded by sea.

Education came through private academies, religious schools, or private tutors. There were no public schools for children. Many children were forced to start working at a young age in order to generate an income for the family anyway.
