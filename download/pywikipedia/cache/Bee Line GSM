'''''Beeline''''' ([[Russian language | Russian]]:"Билайн") is a trademark of the second largest cell-phone operator in [[Russian Federation]]. The company name is VimpelCom. Its headquarters are located in [[Moscow]].

As of January 2005 Bee Line has more than 25 million subscribers in 74 of 89 Russian regions, and in Kazakhstan, and less than 1% market share short of becoming the leader of the Russian cellular market in terms of subscriber base. Its revenue, profits and revenue per subscriber ([[ARPU]]) figures are slightly lower that competitor's, [[Mobile TeleSystems]]'s, while being gradually improving in latest years.

It's current (As of January, 2005) license portfolio covers territory where 94% of Russian population reside, and 100% territory of Kazakhstan.

Vimpelcom was founded in [[1992]] and initially operated [[AMPS]]/[[DAMPS]] network in Moscow area. In [[1996]] Vimpelcom became the first Russian company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ({{NYSE|VIP}}).

In [[1997]] the company began [[GSM]] network roll-out. In [[2001]] it started to start GSM networks throughout [[Russia]]'s regions, having gradually increased its regional presence to the majority of Russia's territory. 

In [[2004]] Vimpelcom, in its first move outside Russia's territory, acquired Kazakhstani cellular operator KaR-Tel (brand names [[K-Mobile]] and [[Excess]]).

In November 2005 Vimpelcom stepped further with foreign acquisitions by acquiring 100% of [[Ukrainian RadioSystems]], a marginal [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] GSM operator operating under Wellcom and Mobi brands. The deal has been sorrounded by a controversy involving two major shareholders of Vimpelcom: the Russian [[Alfa_Group|Alfa Group]] and [[Telenor]], the incumbent telco in [[Norway]]. 

In 2004 Vimpelcom CEO Alexander Izosimov, formerly a top [[Mars, Incorporated]] executive, was named the best Russian manager by the Managers Association of Russia.

Vimpelcom's main competitors are [[Mobile TeleSystems]] and [[MegaFon]]. 

One of the internationally known shareholders of Vimpelcom is [[Telenor]], Norwegian telecom conglomerate.
