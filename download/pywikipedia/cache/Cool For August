'''Cool For August''' was a rock band consisting of notable Canadian singer-songwriter Shad Hills on guitar, [[Andrew Shives]] on bass, Gordan Vaughn on vocals, Trevor Kustibak on guitar, and Shane Hills on drums.  They made their television debut on Conan O'Brien with their hit song "Trials".  While it wasn't their highest-charting single, "Walk Away" was considered their most accessible song and received it's own single in stores.  The band resurfaced a few years later in 2001 (after long speculation that the band had broke up) with an online single "Say it isn't So".  The band completed a demo of six songs (produced by Jeff Tomei and Joey Huffman), about half of an anticipated upcoming album.  However, with no more support from Warner Brothers or any other major labels, the band called it quits.
