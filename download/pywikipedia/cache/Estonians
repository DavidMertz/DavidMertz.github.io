'''Estonians''' are an [[ethnic group]] primarily associated with [[Estonia]] and the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] [[Estonian language]].

==History==
The name "Eesti", or Estonia, is thought to be derived from the word ''[[Aestii]]'', the name given by the ancient [[Germanic peoples]] to the peoples living northeast of the [[Vistula River]]. The Roman historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in [[98]] A.D. was the first to mention the "''Aestii''" people, and early [[Scandinavia]]ns called the land south of the Gulf of Finland "''Eistland''", and the people "''eistr''". Proto-Estonians (as well as other Finnic-speaking peoples) were also called ''[[Chud]]s'' (''чудь'') in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]] [[chronicle]]s.

Estonian language belongs to the [[Balto-Finnic]] branch of the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] group of languages, as does the [[Finnish language]]. The first book in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] was printed in [[1525]], while the oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th century chronicles.

Estonians have strong ties to the [[Nordic countries]] stemming from strong cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germany|German]] rule and settlement. 

From 1945-89 the share of ethnic Estonians in Estonia dropped from 94% to 61%, caused primarily by the deportations organized by the Soviet regime and the Soviet mass immigration program from [[Russia]] and other parts of the former [[USSR]] into industrial urban areas of Estonia, as well as by wartime emigration and Stalin's [[population transfer|mass deportations]] and executions. The ethnic Estonian population has now risen close to 69%.

Most of emigré Estonians live in Russia, Finland, Sweden, US, Canada or other Western countries. In neighbouring [[Latvia]], there are around 2,700 ethnic Estonians (1997 census), in [[Lithuania]], the number was 600 in 1989.

== Emigration ==
During [[World War II]], when Estonia was invaded by the [[Soviet Army]] in [[1944]], large numbers of Estonians fled their homeland on ships or smaller boats over the [[Baltic Sea]]. Many of those refugees who survived the risky sea voyage to [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]], later moved on from there and settled in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. Some of these refugees and their descendants returned to Estonia after the nation regained its independence in [[1991]].
