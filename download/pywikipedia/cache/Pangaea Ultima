'''Pangaea Ultima''' is a possible future [[supercontinent]] configuration, which, consistent with the [[supercontinent cycle]], may occur within the next 250 million years.  This potential configuration, hypothesized by [[Christopher Scotese]], earned its name from its similarity to the previous [[Pangaea]] supercontinent.<ref name="scotese">{{cite web | url = http://www.scotese.com/future2.htm | last = Scotese | first = Christopher R. | title = Pangea Ultima will form 250 million years in the Future | work = Paleomap Project | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref>

Supercontinents describe the merger of all, or nearly all, of the [[Earth]]'s landmass into a single continuous [[continent]].  In the Pangaea Ultima scenario, [[subduction]] at the western [[Atlantic]], east of the [[Americas]] (signs of it can be seen today, the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]), leads to the subduction of the [[Atlantic]] [[mid-ocean ridge]] followed by subduction destroying the [[Atlantic]] [[oceanic basin]], causing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to close, bringing the [[Americas]] back together with [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].  As with most supercontinents, the interior of Pangaea Ultima would probably become a semi-arid desert prone to temperature extremes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kargel | first = Jeffrey S. | title = Mars | origdate = 2004-08-01 | publisher = Springer | id = ISBN 1-85233-568-8 | chapter = New World}}</ref>

==Formation==
The Atlantic and Indian Oceans will continue to widen until new [[subduction zone]]s bring the continents back together, forming a Future Pangea. It seems that most continents and microcontinents collide to Eurasia, such as [[India]], and in the future, [[Africa]], and [[Australia]], just as they did when most continents collided to [[Laurentia]].

50 million years into future looks slightly strange.  [[North America]] is rotated slightly counter-clockwise (Alaska is now near the subtropical latitudes) and [[Eurasia]] is rotated clockwise bringing [[Britain]] closer to the North Pole and [[Siberia]] southward towards warm, [[subtropical]] latitudes. Africa will collide with Europe and Arabia closing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (completely closing the [[Tethys Ocean]] (or Neotethys)) and the [[Red Sea]]. A long mountain range will extend from [[Spain]], across Southern [[Europe]] (the Mediterranean Mountain Range), through the Mideast and into [[Asia]]. Some will even have peaks higher than [[Mt. Everest]]. Similarly, [[Australia]] will beach itself on the doorstep of Southeast Asia and a new subduction zone encircles Australia and extends westward across the Central Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, [[Baja California]] has already collided with Alaska, forming new mountain ranges between them. 

One of the most important changes in the geography of the future, is the beginning of [[subduction]] along the eastern coasts of North America and South America. The Atlantic Ocean has widened, even though the [[Puerto Rican Trench]] and [[Scotia Arc]] may propagate northward and southward along the east coast of North and South America.  In time, this new westward dipping subduction zone will consume the Atlantic Ocean. 

About 100 million years from now, the [[Atlantic]] ocean stops widening, and begins to shrink because a bit of the Atlantic Ocean mid-ridge has been subducted. A mid ocean ridge between [[South America]] and [[Africa]] will probably be subducted first.

150 million years from now, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] has narrowed as a result of subduction beneath the Americas.  The [[Indian Ocean]] is also smaller due to northward subduction of oceanic crust into the Central Indian trench.  Antarctica has collided along the southern margin of Australia because the [[Central Indian Trench]] and the [[South Australian Trench]] pushes [[Antarctica]] northward to Australia, which is now collided with [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the last vestige of sea floor spreading in the Atlantic Ocean, has nearly been subducted beneath eastern North America. The rock layers that contain the remains of ancient New York City, Boston and Washington lie atop high mountain ranges. 

When the last bit of the Mid-Atlantic spreading ridge is subducted beneath the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean will rapidly close and a new Pangea will form.

250 million years in the future, the Atlantic and Indian oceans have closed. [[North America]] has collided with [[Africa]], but in a more southerly position than where it rifted. [[South America]] is wrapped around the southern tip of Africa, with [[Patagonia]] in contact with Indonesia, enclosing a remnant of the Indian Ocean (called the Indo-Atlantic Ocean). [[Antarctica]] is once again at the South Pole and the [[Pacific]] has grown wider, encircling half the [[Earth]]. Like the other major supercontinents, Pangea-Ultima will probably have a very large [[desert]] on its center, and extreme [[temperatures]].

==The Break Up==
The break-up of Pangea-Ultima may occur more than 300 million years into the future, and it will probably create a new ocean, just like the [[Atlantic]], but no one knows what the Earth  will look like when Pangea-Ultima breaks. But maybe like the previous [[Pangaea]], Pangaea Ultima will probably break up in middle of the continent, with the rifting outflow coming from the Pacific. The site of the rifting will possibly be the North America, [[South America]], and southern [[Africa]] continent. The flow from the Pacific will probably go from these three continents to the Indo-Atlantic Ocean - the inland ocean in Pangaea Ultima (the remnant of the Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s). Then like the previous Pangaea, this flow will separate the continent in  half, pushing Eurafrasia-Australia-Antarctica northwards, while the Americas southward ([[Patagonia]] will separate from [[Southeast Asia]]), creating a new ocean between these continents. But [[North America|North]] and South America will be separated. The continuation of the separation of Africa from North America, and [[Australia]]/[[Antarctica]] separation from [[Asia]], which will also open a new ocean between them. Nobody knows what these continents do when they continue to separate. More rifting will continue, and the fragmented pieces may collide with each other, creating a new supercontinent.

It is by no means certain that this configuration will actually occur.  An alternative scenario, in which the Atlantic continues to grow and the [[Pacific]] is largely consumed by the collision between the Americas and [[Asia]], is referred to as the [[Amasia (continent)|Amasia]] supercontinent.

==Appearances in Media==
* The [[National Geographic]] series ''[[Naked Science]]'': Colliding Continents, mentions the formation of Pangaea Ultima.
* In the [[Michael Swanwick]] novel ''[[Bones of the Earth]]'', a version of this supercontinent - called Ultima Pangea - is depicted in the fictitious Telezoic Era roughly 500 million years into the future. It is the home of the Unchanging, a new dominant [[avian]] species.
