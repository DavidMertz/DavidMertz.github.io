The '''Tripoli Rocketry Association''' is one of the two major organizing bodies for [[high powered rocket|high power rocketry]] in the [[USA]] (See also: [[National Association of Rocketry]]).  It was founded in 1964 as a high school science club, and slowly evolved into a national organization.  Tripoli organizes many launches, both local ones organized through local prefectures and larger national launches like [[LDRS]] and [[BALLS]].  They also provide insurance for organized launches, and handle certification of members for flying high power rockets.
