'''H7N2''' is a subtype of the species [[Influenzavirus A| Influenza A virus]] (sometimes called [[bird flu]] virus). One person in [[New York]] in [[2003]] and one person in [[Virginia]] in [[2002]] were found to have serologic evidence of infection with H7N2. Both fully recovered.

The [[CDC]] reports:
:In [[February 2004]], an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influena (LPAI) A (H7N2) was reported on 2 [[chicken]] farms in [[Delaware]] and in four live bird markets in [[New Jersey]] supplied by the farms. In [[March 2004]], surveillance samples from a flock of chickens in [[Maryland]] tested positive for LPAI H7N2. It is likely that this was the same strain. <ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/us.htm CDC]</ref>

A [[CDC]] study following the [[2002]] outbreaks of H7N2 in  commercial poultry farms in western Virginia concluded:
:An important factor contributing to rapid early spread of AI virus infection among commercial poultry farms during this outbreak was disposal of dead birds via rendering off-farm. Because of the highly infectious nature of AI virus and the devastating economic impact of outbreaks, poultry farmers should consider carcass disposal techniques that do not require off-farm movement, such as burial, composting, or incineration. <ref>[http://avianinfluenza.researchtoday.net/cgi-bin/researchtoday.cgi?TopicName=Avian%20Influenza&AbstractID=19 flu research]</ref>
