Located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], at the crossroads of [[U.S. Highway 87]] and [[Interstate 20]], '''Big Spring'''’s population of 25,233 ([[2000]] Census) makes it the largest city between [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] to the west, [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] to the east, [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] to the north, and [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] to the south. Big Spring was established as the [[county seat]] of [[Howard County, Texas|Howard County]] in 1882 and is also the largest city in that county. It was named for the spring in nearby Sulphur Draw. The spring was the center of a territorial dispute between [[Comanche]] and [[Shawnee]] peoples and a popular watering hole for wildlife in the mostly arid area.

==Geography==
Big Spring is located at {{coor dms|32|14|36|N|101|28|31|W|city}} (32.243198, -101.475231){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 49.7 [[km²]] (19.2 [[square mile|mi²]]). 49.5 km² (19.1 mi²) of it is land and 0.2 km² (0.1 mi²) of it (0.42%) is water.

== History ==
Although the area had long been a popular watering hole for [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native Americans]] including members of the [[Pawnee]] and [[Comanche]] nations, the first [[European]] to view the site now known as Big Spring was probably a member of a [[Spain|Spanish]] expedition, possibly that of [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]]. [[United States Army]] [[Captain]] [[Randolph B. Marcy]]'s expedition was the first [[United States]] expedition to [[explore]] and [[map]] the area in [[1849]]. [[Randolph B. Marcy|Marcy]] marked the spring as a [[campsite]] on the [[Overland Trail]] to [[California]]. The site began to collect inhabitants and by the late [[1870s]], a settlement had sprung up to support [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunters that frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and [[saloon]]s. [[Ranching]] quickly became a major [[industry]] in the area; early [[ranchers]] included F.G. Oxsheer, C.C. Slaughter, and B.F. Wolcott..<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/BB/heb9.html Big Spring History Page] on [http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/ The Handbook of Texas Online], </ref> 

One notable early rancher was [[Great Britain|Briton]] Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased 37,000 [[acre]]s of [[ranch]] [[land]] in the area in [[1883]], and is credited with building Big Spring's first permanent structure, a [[butcher]] shop.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/HH/hch20.html Howard County page] on [http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/ The Handbook of Texas Online], </ref> 

The completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early 1880s of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Colorado City, Texas|Colorado City]], and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching towns where saloons, gambling dens, and prostitutes flourished. These establishments attracted cowboys and later oilfield workers from throughout the region. [[Prostitution]] continuted to flourish in Big Spring well into the 1950s. The Settles Hotel was well known as a center for prostitution in Big Spring, with the large sign on the roof being used to signal the presence of prostitutes in the hotel.

In 1957 anti-prostitution groups gained an influential advocate in Texas attorney general Will Wilson, whose office led the way in disrupting Texas prostitution, including the Galveston racketeers. Church, legal and news media pressure forced many brothels to close and set the prostitution business on a downward course that continued into the 1960s. Wilson's was influential in pressing local law-enforcement officials into curbing prostitution in Big Spring.
