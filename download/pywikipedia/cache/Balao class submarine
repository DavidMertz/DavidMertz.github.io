The '''''Balao'' class''' was a successful design of [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]] used during [[World War II]].  An evolutionary improvement over the earlier [[Gato class submarine|''Gato'' class]], the boats had slight internal differences.  The most significant improvement was the use of higher strength steel in the pressure hull, which increased their [[test depth]] to 400 feet.  There are 132 submarines in this class.
