==Trivia==
* The Fourth Circuit has never seen one of its judges promoted to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  Judges Wilkinson and Luttig were long considered to be front-runners for a justiceship if a vacancy arose during the [[George W. Bush]] presidential administration, but Bush did not appoint either of them to the two vacancies that arose in 2005.  Luttig has since resigned from the bench.
* Since the days of [[John Marshall]], the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] has been the [[Circuit Justice]] for the Fourth Circuit.
* The Fourth Circuit's Courthouse in [[Richmond, Virginia]] housed the treasury of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], and [[Jefferson Davis]]'s office was located in the building.  After the war, Davis was arraigned in the building, although he was never tried.
* The Fourth is widely regarded as the most ideologically conservative court in the federal appellate system.  It is also the most efficient circuit, taking an average of just over seven months to resolve each appeal.
* The Fourth Circuit is considered an extremely collegial court.  By tradition, the Judges of the Fourth Circuit come down from the bench following each [[oral argument]] to greet the lawyers.
