The '''American Reform Party''' is a minor [[political party]] in the [[United States]] that was formed in a factional split from the larger [[Reform Party USA|Reform Party of the United States]] in October 1997. The split occurred when some members of the Reform Party, believing that party founder [[Ross Perot]] had rigged the party's 1996 presidential nomination for himself, walked out of the national convention.

Although members of the group attempted to persuade former [[Colorado]] Governor [[Dick Lamm]], Perot's chief rival for the nomination, to run for president as an Independent, he declined, pointing out that he had promised before running that he would not challenge the party's decision.

Since then, the ARP has yet to organize in more than a few states.  In both [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]], the American Reform Party supported [[Ralph Nader]] for president.

The [[Reform Party (Northern Mariana Islands)|Reform Party of Northern Mariana Islands]] is an affiliate of the American Reform Party.
