The '''secret ballot''' is a voting method in which a [[voter]]'s choices are confidential.   The key aim is to ensure  the voter records a sincere choice by forestalling attempts to influence the voter by [[intimidation]] or [[bribery]].

The system is one means of achieving the goal of [[political privacy]]. Secret ballots are suitable for many different [[voting system]]s.

The most basic form may be blank pieces of paper, upon which each voter writes only their choice. Without revealing their vote to anyone, the voters place the [[ballot]]s into a sealed box, which is emptied later for counting.

One of the most common forms in the modern world provides for pre-printed [[ballot]] papers with the name of the candidates or questions and respective checkboxes. Provisions are made at the polling place for the voter to record their preferences in secret.  The ballots are specifically designed to eliminate bias and to prevent anyone from linking voter to ballot. This system is also known as the '''Australian ballot''', because it originated in [[Australia]] during the 1850s.

==History==
Today the practice of casting secret ballots is so commonplace that most voters would not consider that any other method might be used, yet in the 19th century it was highly controversial.

The demand for a secret ballot was one of the six points of [[Chartism]].
In the words of the [[petition]] that was published in 1838:
"The [[suffrage]], to be exempt from the corruption of the wealthy and the violence of the powerful, must be secret."[http://www.chartists.net/The-six-points]  The [[parliament]] of the time refused to even consider the Chartist demands but it is notable that [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] in his speech of 1842 while rejecting Chartism's six points as a whole admitted that secret ballot was one of the two points he could support.

Chartist ideas influenced the miners of [[Eureka Stockade]] in 1854 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] where they adopted all of Chartism's six points including the secret ballot. 

Secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in the former [[Australia]]n [[colony]] -- now a [[States and territories of Australia|state]] -- of [[Tasmania]] on [[February 7|7 February]] [[1856]]. Until the original Tasmanian Electoral Act of 1856 was 're-discovered' recently, credit for the first implementation of the secret ballot often went to the colonies of Victoria and [[South Australia]].<ref> Terry Newman, 'Tasmania and the Secret Ballot' (2003), 49(1) Aust J Pol & Hist 93 [http://www.enrollingthepeople.com/tasmania/newman_tasmania_and_secret_ballot.pdf], accessed [[February 27]], [[2006]]</ref>  Victoria enacted [[legislation]] for secret ballots on [[March 19]] [[1856]], and South Australian Electoral Commissioner [[William Boothby]] generally gets credit for creating the system finally enacted into law in South Australia on [[April 2]] of that same year (a fortnight later).

In the [[United States]] the practice became known by the name "Australian ballot". The Australian secret ballot is defined as having four parts: "The Austrailian secret ballot is 1) an official ballot being printed at public expense, 2) on which the names of the nominated candidates of all parties and all proposals appear, 3) being distributed only at the polling place and 4) being marked in secret."<ref>See page 59 of: {{cite book

In the United States, most states had moved to secret ballots soon after the presidential election of 1884.  However, the last state in the union to retire the practice of the [[oral ballot]] was Kentucky which did so in 1891.  Therefore, the first [[President of the United States]] elected completely under the Australian ballot was president [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1892.  Elections in the United States are now almost always held by secret ballot, with [[Political party|party]] nominating [[caucus]]es in some states--most significantly the leadoff Presidential nominating state of [[Iowa]]--requiring an open casting of ballots.  A [[Pennsylvania]] state legislator long active in election reform issues, Rep. Mark B. Cohen of [[Philadelphia]], said "The secret ballot guarantees that it is one's private opinion that counts.  Open ballots are not truly free for those whose preferences defy the structures of power or friendship." The Populists, a short-lived American political party during 1870s through 1890s, listed the Australian ballot as one of their party platforms in the [[Ocala Demands]].

==United Kingdom==
The [[United Kingdom|UK]] secret ballot arrangements are sometimes criticised because it is possible to link a ballot paper to the voter that cast it. Each ballot paper is individually numbered and each elector has a number. When an elector is given a ballot paper, their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the ballot paper (which also carries the ballot paper number).

This measure is thought to be justified as a security arrangement so that if there was an allegation of fraud, false ballot papers could be identified. The process of matching ballot papers to voters is only permissible if an Elections Court requires it, and this is an extremely unlikely occurrence. The legal authority for this system is set out in the Parliamentary Elections Rules in Schedule 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/Ballotsecrecy_18706-6127__E__N__S__W__.pdf]
