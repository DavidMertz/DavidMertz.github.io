[[Image:Condom on Obelisk, Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 67 m long "condom" on the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]], Argentina, part of an awareness campaign for the 2005 [[World AIDS Day]]]]

A '''condom''' is a device, usually made of [[latex]], or more recently [[polyurethane]], that is used during [[sexual intercourse]]. It is put on a male partner's [[penis]], for the purpose of preventing [[pregnancy]] and/or transmission of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs) such as [[gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]].

==Overview==
Male condoms are  packaged in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then rolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. They are most commonly made from [[latex]], but are also available in other materials.
As a method of [[contraception]], condoms have the advantage of being easy to use, having few side-effects, and of offering protection against sexually transmitted diseases. With proper knowledge and application technique - and use at every act of intercourse - condom users experience only a 2% per-year pregnancy rate.<!--

Some couples find that putting on a male condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay.  Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation.<!--

==Materials==
===Latex===
[[Image:Condom_unrolled.jpg|thumb|An unrolled latex condom]]
Most modern condoms are made of [[latex]].  This material has outstanding elastic properties. [[Tensile strength]] exceeds 30 MPa. Condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = Relationship of condom strength to failure during use. | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 1-2 | year = 1980 | id = PMID 12264044}}</ref> Natural latex condoms have a minimum thickness of 0.046 mm.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title = Crown Skinless Skin Condoms | work = Condomania Online | date = 2006 | url = http://secure.condomania.com/displaystats.asp?number=C-CR-SL | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref>

Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of [[Nonoxynol-9|nonoxynyl-9]], a spermicidal chemical.  According to [[Consumer Reports]], spermicidally lubricated condoms have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause urinary-tract infections in women.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title = Condoms: Extra protection | work = ConsumerReports.org | date = February 2005 | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/health-care/condoms-and-contraception-205/overview/index.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-06 }}</ref> [[Nonoxynol-9|nonoxynyl-9]] was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown the opposite to be the case. The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.  However, they recommend using a nonoxynol-9 lubricated condom over no condom at all.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title = Microbicides | work = World Health Organization | date = 2006 | url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/microbicides/microbicides/en/ | accessdate = 2006-08-06 }}</ref>  In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.<ref name="simultaneous" />

===Polyurethane===
Polyurethane condoms can be thinner than latex condoms, with some polyurethane condoms only 0.02 mm thick.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web | title = Sagami Original | work = Japanese Condoms | date = 2006? | url = http://condomsjapan.com/?mode=2&category=1&id=1029&page=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref>

[[Polyurethane]] can be considered better than [[latex]] in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based lubricants, is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.<!--

However, polyurethane condoms are more likely to slip or break than latex,<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Frezieres R, Walsh T, Nelson A, Clark V, Coulson A | title = Breakage and acceptability of a polyurethane condom: a randomized, controlled study. | journal = Fam Plann Perspect | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 73-8 | year = | id = PMID 9561872}}</ref> are more expensive, and may not be as effective in protecting against STDs (large clinical trials have not been performed).<!--
 --><ref name="nonlatex" />

===Lambskin===
Condoms made from one of the oldest condom materials, labeled "lambskin" (made from [[lamb]] [[intestine]]s) are still available.  They have a greater ability to transmit body warmth and tactile sensation, when compared to [[synthetic]] condoms, and are less allergenic than latex.  However, there is a great risk of transmitting STDs because of pores in the material.  While the pores are not large enough to allow sperm out, much smaller bacteria and viruses may easily slip in and out between the condom.

===Invisible===
The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Québec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. The invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.<!-- --><ref>{{cite web | title = Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom® in Healthy Women | work = ClinicalTrials.gov | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health | date = August 2005 | url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 | accessdate = 2006-08-14 }}</ref>

===Spray-on===
As reported on Swiss television news [[Schweizer Fernsehen]] on November 29, 2006, scientist Jan Vinzenz Krause of the Swiss Institut für Kondom-Beratung ("Institute for Condom Consultation") recently developed a spray-on condom and is test-marketing it. Krause says the advantages to his spray-on condom, which is reported to dry in about 5 seconds, is that it is perfectly formed to each penis.   <ref name="spraytv">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140|title=Spray-On-Condom|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen News|year=Nov. 29, 2006|format=streaming video [Real format]}}</ref> <ref name="spray">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php?|title=Spray-On-Condom|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=Institut für Kondom-Beratung|year=2006|format=html}}</ref>

==Form==
[[Image:Condoms by Morrhigan.jpg|thumb|left|Condoms in many colors]]
[[Image:McCondom dsc06781.jpg|thumb|100px|An example of flavoured condoms]]
In recent decades, condom makers have diversified in colors, shapes, and thicknesses. Flavors or designs thought to have stimulating properties are sometimes added. Such stimulating properties include enlarged tips or pouches to fit the [[glans penis]] better and textured surfaces such as ribbing or studs (small bumps). Many condoms have [[spermicide|spermicidal]] [[personal lubricant|lubricant]] added, but it is not an effective substitute for separate spermicide use. Most condoms have a reservoir tip, making it easier to leave space for the man's ejaculate.  Condoms also come in different sizes, from magnum to snug.

==Testing==
In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms) and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices).

Condoms are tested for holes with an electrical current.  If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged.  Batches of condoms are tested for breakage with air inflation tests.<!--

==Effectiveness==
===In preventing pregnancy===
The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways: method effectiveness and actual effectiveness.  The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant.  Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all.  Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.

For all forms of contraception, actual effectiveness is lower than method effectiveness, due to several factors:
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method's users
* conscious user non-compliance with method.
For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, or by mistake not take the pill one day, or simply not bother to go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription.

The method failure rate of condoms is 2% per year.<ref name="hatcher" /> The actual pregnancy rates among condoms users vary depending on the population being studied, with rates of 10-18% per year being reported.<!--

===In preventing STDs===
According to a 2001 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]],<ref>"<cite>Recently, a number of Federal agencies sponsored a workshop to answer the following question: "What is the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of latex male condom-use to prevent STD transmission during vaginal intercourse?" This workshop was attended by 180 persons, and the data from numerous peer-reviewed published studies were discussed. Following the workshop, a panel of 28 experts worked to develop this report.</cite>" [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/condomreport.pdf Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention]</ref> correct and consistent use of ''latex'' condoms:

* reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected. See overall [[HIV#Transmission|HIV transmission rates]].
* reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men by approximately 71% relative to risk when unprotected.

A [[University of Washington]] study published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in June 2006 reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission for [[human papilloma virus]] by approximately 70%.<ref><cite>The incidence of genital HPV infection was 37.8 per 100 patient-years at risk among women whose partners used condoms for all instances of intercourse during the eight months before testing, as compared with 89.3 per 100 patient-years at risk in women whose partners used condoms less than 5 percent of the time. Among newly sexually active women, consistent condom use by their partners appears to reduce the risk of cervical and vulvovaginal HPV infection.</cite> [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 Condom Use and the Risk of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Young Women]</ref>

Contraceptive Technology concluded that condom failure due to breakage and leakage amounted to 8.08 percent per sexual encounter.  {{citation needed}}

Other [http://www.fda.gov/FDAC/features/1998/298_con.html studies] have shown that the proper and consistent use of condoms prevented HIV from spreading from an infected partner to a non-infected partner in every case. 

While different studies show a wide range of results, every scientific study verifies that engaging in sex with a STD positive partner without a condom increases the chances of transmitting an STD when compared to sex with a condom.

Other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s may be affected as well, but they could not draw definite conclusions from the research they were working with. In particular, these include STDs associated with [[ulcer]]ative lesions that may be present on body surfaces where the condom doesn't cover, such as [[Herpes simplex#Genital infection (Generally HSV 2)|genital herpes simplex]] (HSV), [[chancroid]], and [[syphilis]].  If [http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.asp?asgid=31&agid=9&id=738 contact] is made with uncovered lesions, transmission of these STIs may still occur despite appropriate condom use.  Additionally, the absence of visible lesions or symptoms cannot be used to decide whether caution is needed.

An article in ''The American Journal of Gynecologic Health''<ref>"<cite>In a study, all women who correctly and consistently used Reality were protected from Trichomonas vaginalis, while sporadic users were not protected.</cite>" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12288250&dopt=Abstract The female condom: STD protection in the hands of women.]</ref> showed that "all women who correctly and consistently used Reality® were protected from [[Trichomonas vaginalis]]" (referring to a particular brand of [[Condom#female condoms|female condom]]).

===Causes of failure===
{{wikibookspar|Sexual Health|Barrier Birth Control and Spermicide}}
Condoms may fail due to faulty methods of application or physical damage (such as tears caused when opening the package), bursting caused by latex degradation (typically from being past the expiration date or being stored improperly), and from slipping off the penis during intercourse or after ejaculation. Sometimes pregnancy may result even without an obvious failure at the time of use. 

While standard condoms will fit almost any penis, some men may find that use of 'snug' or 'magnum' condoms decreases the risk of slippage, leaking, and bursting.  Ethnic differences may play a role in correct sizing; a small exploratory portion of a 2006 [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] study concluded that standard condom sizes were too large for many among India's men.<ref name="indiasize">{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Condoms_now_in_market_oversized_for_Indian_men/articleshow/738916.cms|title=Condoms now in market oversized for Indian men|accessdate=2006-12-15|publisher=The Times of India|year=8 Dec. 2006|author=Madhavi Rajadhyaksha|format=html}}</ref> <ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16157113/</ref>

Experienced condom users are significantly less likely to have a condom slip or break compared to first-time users, although users who experience one slippage or breakage are at increased risk of a second such failure <!--

It is believed that instruction in proper condom use also reduces failure rates.

Among couples that intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the couple does not use a condom. The couple may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance." This type of behavior is the primary cause of "typical use" failure (as opposed to "method" or "perfect use" failure).<!--

Saboteurs usually pierce the condom's tip multiple times before intercourse.

==Health issues==
[[Carcinogen]]ic [[nitrosamine]]s have been discovered in 29 out of 32 condom brands tested by the Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Institute in [[Stuttgart]].<ref>"<cite>The Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Institute in Stuttgart said on Friday it had found the carcinogen N-Nitrosamine in 29 of 32 types of condoms it tested in simulated conditions.</cite>" [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1220847,00.html German Study Says Condoms Contain Cancer-causing Chemical]</ref> However, there have been no studies linking the use of condoms to an increased risk of [[cancer]] and a 2001 study from the [[University of Kiel]] concluded that humans regularly receive 1,000 to 10,000 times greater nitrosamine exposure from food and tobacco than from condom use and concluded that the risk of cancer from condom use is very low.<ref>"<cite>In addition, humans are regularly exposed to nitrosamines from food and tobacco smoke at a dose which is 1,000 to 10,000 fold higher than expected from condom use. In summary, the risk for the induction of tumors from nitrosamines in condoms is very low.</cite>" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11759152&query_hl=4&itool=pubmed_docsum Toxicological evaluation of nitrosamines in condoms.]</ref>

Some lubricated condoms are produced with dusting powders, such as [[talc]], which aren't recommended by the University of Virginia School of Medicine for surgery because of "acute & chronic problems" that may arise if the powders find their way into the abdominal cavity (i.e. via the [[vagina]]).<ref>"<cite>These dusting powders can gain access to the abdominal cavity through the vagina or through surgical intervention. The toxicity of these dusting powders in the abdominal cavity can be divided into acute and chronic complications that may be life-threatening. The use of medical and surgical products without dusting powders is strongly recommended.</cite>" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10167361&query_hl=15&itool=pubmed_docsum Potential toxicity of retrograde uterine passage of particulate matter.]</ref>

Condoms lubricated with the spermicide [[Nonoxynol-9]] may increase the user's risk of contracting [[HIV]] and other sexually transmitted diseases. For this reason, [[Planned Parenthood]] has discontinued the distribution of condoms so lubricated, and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has proposed a warning regarding this issue.<ref>"<cite>Nonoxynol 9 works as a vaginal contraceptive by damaging the cell membrane of sperm. It has been shown in laboratory studies to damage the cell walls of certain organisms that cause STDs and to be active against some STD-causing bacteria and viruses. On the basis of data that are described in the labeling proposal, FDA believes that this same membrane-damaging effect can harm the cell lining of the vagina and cervix, thereby increasing the risk of STD transmission.</cite>" [http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01191.html FDA proposes new warning for over-the-counter contraceptive drugs containing Nonoxynol-9] <br /> "<cite>The Centers for Disease Control states: 'N-9 can damage the cells lining the rectum, thus providing a portal of entry for HIV and other sexually transmissible agents.

Latex condoms used with oil-based lubricants (e.g. [[vaseline]]) are likely to break due to rapid deterioration caused by the oils.

==Female condoms==
[[Image:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Female condom]]
Recently "'''female condoms'''" or "'''femidoms'''" (not to be confused with [[femdom]]s) have become available. They are larger and wider than male condoms but equivalent in length. Female condoms have a flexible ring-shaped opening, and are designed to be inserted into the [[vagina]]. The female condom also contains an inner ring which aids insertion and helps keep the condom in place inside the vagina. This type of condom was first made from [[polyurethane]], though newer iterations are made of [[nitrile]] (this material change was announced in September 2005).<!--
 --><ref name="FHC press">{{cite press release | title = Female Health Company Announces International Availability of Second - Generation Female Condom at Significantly Lower Price | publisher = Female Health Company | date = September 29, 2005 | url = http://www.femalehealth.com/InvestorRelations/investor_pressreleases/press_2005_09_21_2ndGenerationFC_Announcement.pdf  | accessdate = 2006-08-03 }}(PDF)</ref>

Currently, 14 million female condoms are distributed to women in the developing world on an annual basis.  By comparison, between 6 and 9 billion male condoms are distributed per annum.<!--

Sales of female condoms have been disappointing in developed countries, though developing countries are increasingly using them to complement already existing family planning and HIV/AIDS programming.<!--

Also, reported "rustling" sounds during intercourse turn off some potential users, as does the visibility of the outer ring which remains outside the vagina.<!--

The newer nitrile condoms are less likely to make these potentially distracting noises. It is hoped the nitrile condoms will also allow for significant reductions in female condom pricing.<ref name="FHC press" />

Female condoms have the advantage of being compatible with oil-based lubricants as they are not made of latex.<!--

In November 2005, the World [[YWCA]] called on national health ministries and international donors to commit to purchasing 180 million female condoms for global distribution in 2006. Their statement stated that "''Female condoms remain the only tool for HIV prevention that women can initiate and control''," but that they remain virtually inaccessible to women in the developing world due to their high cost of 72 cents per piece. If 180 million female condoms were ordered, the price of the female condom was projected to decline to 22 cents per female condom.<ref name="YWCA" />

=== Effectiveness and Risks of Female Condoms === 

The typical use failure rate for the first-generation female condoms lies at 21%. This means that of the women who intend to use female condoms as their only form of birth control, 21 out of 100 will become pregnant within one year. Among women who use the condom correctly at every act of intercourse, 5% will become pregnant after one year.<!--
  --><ref name="hatcher" />

The effectiveness of the female condom at preventing STDs has not been studied to the same extent as male condoms, however it has been put forth that it should have similar effectiveness. They are also dangerous for those who have polyurethane allergies.<!--

==Role in sex education==
[[Image:Posecondom.jpg|thumb|100px|How to put on a condom]]
Condoms are often used in [[sexual education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[APA]] press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''," and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."<!--
 --><ref>{{cite press release | title = Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee | publisher = American Psychological Association|date = [[February 23]] [[2005]] | url = http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref>

In the United States, teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by various religious organizations, primarily some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  Opposition may be based on the belief that teaching about contraception encourages premarital sex, or that only parents have the moral authority to teach children about sex.  Some religions also consider the use of contraception to be immoral - the Catholic Church, for example, teaches that only total abstinence, or periodic abstinence (using [[Natural family planning]]), are moral ways to prevent pregnancy.  The Protestant [[quiverfull]] movement opposes ''all'' methods of family planning, including NFP.  The Heritage Foundation, which opposes comprehensive sex education, believes that any sex education program should teach that "sexual happiness is inherently linked to... marriage,"<!--

Pardue, and Shannan Martin | title = What Do Parents Want Taught in Sex Education Programs? | publisher = The Heritage Foundation|date = [[January 28]] [[2004]] | url = http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg1722.cfm | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref> a moral message that is not found in comprehensive sex ed programs.

Groups such as [[Planned Parenthood]], which advocate [[family planning]] and [[sexual education]], argue that religious opposition to teaching about condoms results in increased number of unwanted pregnancies and the spread of STDs.

It should be noted that the Catholic Church directly condemns only artificial birth control, and sexual acts aside from intercourse between married heterosexual partners.  The use of condoms to combat STDs is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among high-ranking Catholic authorities.  A few, such as Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels, believe the Catholic Church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease, especially serious diseases such as [[AIDS]].  However, to date statements from the Vatican have argued that condom-promotion programs encourage promiscuity, thereby actually increasing STD transmission.<!--

==Use in infertility treatment==
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples.  These are most commonly obtained through masturbation, but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special '''collection condom'''.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm.  Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation.  Also, compared to samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology.  For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as IUI.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite paper | author = Dr. Joanna Ellington | title = Use of a Specialized Condom to Collect Sperm Samples for Fertility Procedures | publisher = INGfertility | date = January 2005 | url = http://www.ingfertility.com/jan_2005_newsletter.html | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] teaches that masturbation is immoral.  For observant Catholics, collection condoms are the only morally permissible way to obtain semen samples. Although detrimental to the purpose, most Catholics put two or three pinholes in the collection condom to avoid violating the Catholic prohibition on artificial birth control.<!--

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of antisperm antibodies.  The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued.  However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.<!--

==Prevalence==
[[Image:Cannstatter-wasen-condom-mobil.jpg|thumb|right|Open sales are encouraged in some jurisdictions]]
Condoms are more accessible in [[developed countries]]. In various cultures, a number of social or economic factors make access to condoms prohibitive. In some cases, cultural beliefs may cause some persons to shun condoms deliberately even when they are available.<ref>"<cite>Two thirds of teenagers in the central African country of Cameroon have sex by the age of 16 and more than half of them shun condoms, according to a study by German aid agency GTZ.</cite>" [http://12.31.13.116/HealthNews/Reuters/20040302elin014.htm Sexually Active Cameroon Youths Shun Condoms]</ref>

Furthermore, regardless of culture and availability, many men shun condoms simply because they dislike using them. This dislike may be due to reduced sexual pleasure or to practical problems, e.g. difficulty in sustaining an erection hard enough for effective condom use.

Because they are generally available without a prescription, and because they have some effectiveness in reducing the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]], condoms tend to be especially popular among younger men, those who are not in exclusive partnerships, and newly-formed monogamous couples. Often, once a steady relationship has deepened, the woman may begin to use [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal]] or some other type of highly effective [[contraceptive]], at which time condom use typically (though not always) comes to an end. Ideally, however, this should not occur until blood tests have shown both partners to be free of infection.

Most research has revealed, through survey, four factors which establish the minimal use of condoms: various encumbering beliefs, reduced sexual pleasure, adverse experiences, and fears related to gender and tensions.  New technology and beneficial studies have come forth that combat these various factors, however only a small proportion of individuals world-wide actually practice [[safe sex]].{{Citation needed}}  This noticeable gap has lead several investigators to analyze whether [[social]] factors might be involved such as a residual [[social stigma]] attached to condoms.

In broad detail, social factors range from geographical location to race, and become as specified as methamphetamine versus non-drug users, so [[correlations]] within this research are not always strong and accurate, but it does establish that correlations do exist.

===Geographic location===
Several regions provide examples of social factors influencing the use of condoms within their populace.  Two examples which contrast the effects of similar problems are [[South Africa]] and rural [[Lebanon]].

South Africa has some of the highest [[HIV]] rates in the world, so there the statistics on condom use are being studied heavily. As of 2001, the 21-25 year age group has the peak rate of infection at 43.1%.<!--
 --><ref name="South Africa">{{cite journal | author = MacPhail C, Campbell C | title = 'I think condoms are good but, aai, I hate those things': condom use among adolescents and young people in a Southern African township. | journal = Soc Sci Med | volume = 52 | issue = 11 | pages = 1613-27 | year = 2001|id = PMID 11327136}}</ref>  These studies became more specified and it was discovered that despite all the information known today about HIV and the spread of infection, many [[young people]] of the study did not feel that they were in danger of contracting this disease.  In fact, only 30% of people, males and females, felt they had any risk of contracting HIV at all. Of those that said they felt there was any chance of contracting HIV, only 12.9% thought there was a moderate chance, and 17.6% thought they had a good chance of [[infection]]. It seems that even though the youth of South Africa do have a relatively high level of knowledge concerning the [[risk factor]]s of getting HIV, many feel that it simply won't happen to them.  Many of the factors found in South Africa apply to well [[developed countries]] of the world and these new findings hopefully will help shape future campaigns against decreased condom use in the future.

Another end of the spectrum are the rural areas of Lebanon in the [[Middle East]].  Generally, the use of condoms and other forms of [[contraceptives]] in the Middle East is low even though there is a growing awareness of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and HIV/AIDS.<!--
 --><ref name="Lebanon">{{cite journal | author = Kulczycki A | title = The sociocultural context of condom use within marriage in rural Lebanon. | journal = Stud Fam Plann | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 246-60 | year = 2004|id = PMID 15628783}}</ref>  A study revealed that only twenty-four percent of the women in the regions ever used a condom.  A household survey was also done on condom use which found that ninety-eight percent of women had indeed heard of contraceptive methods, but only eighty-five percent of the women had heard of condoms.  Some things to keep in mind also are that women in this culture are not expected to have knowledge or express openly knowledge of contraceptives or even sexuality.  Also some background that is needed on the group surveyed is that the marital [[fertility rate]] of the surveyed women were about five children per woman, and each of the women had a different level of education.  About sixty-one percent had intermediate-level education, twenty percent had a primary education, and eighteen percent had trouble reading or could not read at all.  This provides evidence that condom use varies dependent on social factors like the area’s cultural background and education.

It should be noted that largely the variances in geographical location are highly affected by culture and cultural beliefs, as well as class and race, but also have dynamic influences resounding from [[economic]] yield for the area, use and expansion of [[communication]], and other criteria.  These social factors can again be examined in South Africa and rural Lebanon:

An example is that in South Africa, it was discovered that condom availability is a problem for young adults.<!--
 --><ref name="South Africa" />  Although condoms are given away by local clinics, many participants stated that there are instances when they found themselves without condoms because they never know when they are going to need one.  Thus, this higher economic region has properly developed health services; they are just not being properly utilized by the public.

Opposing in the lower economic region of rural Lebanon, another reason for the lack of condom use is that public health services and family planning services are very inadequately developed.  A health service that is trying to help is the Lebanese Family Planning Association but their funding is very limited and recently they have not been able to increase its budget to promote more complete reproductive health service.

Despite these specific social factors contributing to the differences between these regions and others, most research has identified issues such as trust and gender power in relationships and others as socially relevant to almost all countries worldwide.

===Drug use===
Condom use among [[intravenous drug]] users is low.  One study found that only 99 of 699 male Out-of-Treatment Injection Drug Users (OTIDUs) participating in the study reported always using a condom.  Of the 232 women OTIDUs, 22 claimed their male partner always used a condom.  [[Methamphetamine]] in particular has been associated with even lower use of condoms, however.  When the same study was restricted to methamphetamine users only, condom use rates dropped to a mere one third and one fourth of the above statistics, respectively.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Semple S, Patterson T, Grant I | title = Determinants of condom use stage of change among heterosexually identified methamphetamine users. | journal = AIDS Behav | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 391-400 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15690112}}</ref>

===Anti-condom trends===
Studies have shown [[baby boomer]]s are increasingly contracting sexually transmitted diseases because they choose not to wear condoms. Many have been married, and separated, and now have random sexual partners.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite news  | last = Watt | first = Emily | title = Older Adults Shy Away From Safe Sex Advice | publisher = The Sunday Star-Times (Auckland, New Zealand)|date = 24-04-2005 }}</ref> Several reasons for this choice are given. Since the women are no longer capable of conceiving children, they do not see the large risk in not protecting themselves, and thus the importance of a condom becomes minimal. Also, since many of them have just come out of a [[long term relationship]], they are starting over and they are too uncomfortable with their new partner to ask them to use a condom.

The practice of [[barebacking]] in Western [[gay culture]] is another example of a trend away from condoms. Barebacking partners often know that they could reduce their risk of sexually transmitted infection by using a condom, but choose not to.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Crossley M | title = Making sense of 'barebacking': gay men's narratives, unsafe sex and the 'resistance habitus'. | journal = Br J Soc Psychol | volume = 43 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 225-44 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15285832}}</ref>

==Laws and policies restricting condoms==
{{expandsect}}

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], condoms (and other contraceptives) were originally available only to those with a doctors prescription (finding a doctor willing to prescribe them was very difficult - almost impossible if one was unmarried) or via the black market (usually smuggled from Northern  Ireland). This was later altered to being available only to those over the age of 18 in pharmacies in 1985. Sale outside of pharmacies was only legalised in 1993, although stores such as the [[Virgin Megastore]] had in fact been selling them openly since 1988. The age limitations were also removed in 1993.

===Philippines===
The [[Philippines]] is a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] is a powerful force in Philippine politics.  The Church teaches that only [[natural family planning]] methods are moral ways to prevent pregnancy, and opposes promotion of condoms for any purpose. 

While condoms are legal in the Philippines, the government will not promote them or pay for their distribution.  As of 2004, several local officials - including the mayor of [[Manila]] - had banned distribution of condoms in government health facilities, and some locations even ban government health workers from discussing condoms.<!--

===Somalia===
In 2003, a powerful Somalian Muslim group banned selling or using condoms in [[Somalia]]. The punishments for violating this include [[Flagellation|flogging]].<ref>"<cite>Islamic leaders say they have outlawed condoms in Somalia, where the vast majority of the population is Muslim.</cite>" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3340611.stm Somali Muslim group bans condoms]</ref>

==Environmental impact==
While biodegradable, latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. It is estimated that 61 million to 100 million condoms are improperly disposed of in Britain alone, often ending up in rivers or the ocean. According to the Ocean Conservancy, these condoms cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 Ask E - The environmental magazine]</ref>

Condoms made of polyurethane, a plastic material, do not break down at all. There have been no studies to determine if lubricated condoms take longer to biodegrade than non-lubricated ones, but it is believed that their [[landfill]] mass is negligible.<ref>[http://www.goaskalice-cms.org/scripts/printerfriendly.cfm?questionid=2311 Go ask Alice - Environmentally-friendly condom disposal]</ref>

==Etymology==
The most likely origin of the word condom is from the Latin word ''condon'', meaning receptacle.<!--
 --><ref name=pp>{{cite web | title = A History of Birth Control Methods | work = Planned Parenthood | year = June 2002 | url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/birth-control-access-prevention/a-history-of-birth-control-methods.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-05 }}</ref>

Other explanations abound, however. [[Folk etymology]] claims that the word "condom" is derived from a purported "Dr. Condom" or "Quondam", who made the devices for King [[Charles II of England]].  There is no verifiable evidence that any such "Dr. Condom" existed. Other stories tell the word "condom" has its root in the 16th century: in particular, when [[Catherine de Medici]] married [[Henry II of France]], she brought to France her minister Gondi and the architect Bernardo Buontalenti. Gondi and Buontalenti started producing special waxed protections to be used as condoms. The French soon called them "gondon"; "gondone" is today still used as a synonym of "condom" in [[Genova]], Italy; "goldoni", another variation, is still used in [[Milan]], Italy. It may be that the word "condom" is a variation of "gondon".

It is also hypothesized that a British army officer named Cundum popularized the device between 1680 and 1717.<ref>Bernstein EL, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12332250&dopt=Abstract Who was condom?], Hum Fertil. 1940 Dec;5(6):172-5.</ref>

Zacharias P. Thundy states in "The Etymology of Condom" by (American Speech 60, No. 2, 1985) that condom is derived from condamina or house.

William E. Kruck has written an article "Looking for Dr Condom", Publication of the [http://www.americandialect.org American Dialect Society], no. 66, 1981, which is a meticulous repudiation of all the "Dr/Colonel/Earl of Condom" myths about the origin of the condom. It disproves many other theories, e.g., that it was named after a town in France, named after the Latin condus named for the Persian kendü).

==="French letter"===
There are alternative etymologies for the condom:

1. Condom is sometimes considered a clinical expression, it is in fact intimately linked to the history of this fascinating item. In Britain a condom is also known as a French letter, much like the colloquial German word for a condom, "Pariser".  English seventeenth century tourists, travelling through France on their pilgrimage to the center of ancient culture that was Rome, came across the town of [[Condom, Gers|Condom]] in southwestern France.  It is said that there they made contact with ingenious French shepherds who were making prophylactics from sheep gut.  A trade then ensued, whereby the English gentry would eagerly await their letters from France - French Letters - with a fresh supply of condoms.  The French aristocracy then learned of these useful items from their English friends and called them "Capote Anglaise" - English Raincoats.  Thus the condom came full circle, being made in France, being used in London, latterly in Paris, and finally being adopted by the Germans as a Pariser.

2. The English phrase "French letter" expresses the old image (or prejudice) that anything coming from France is decadent and has to do with sex. According to British military history, a Britain's Royal Guards Colonel named Condum, in seventeenth century (when Anglo-French enmity was at its mutual height) devised the French letter to protect his troops from the French by using it.

===Other terms for condoms===
In North America condoms are also commonly known as prophylactics. Many colloquial or slang terms exist, with usage localised across the English speaking world. Examples including "rubbers," "rubber johnny" (or simply "johnny"), "jimmy hats," "rain coats," "Hazmat Suits," "Rubber Straightjackets," and "love gloves." Condoms may also be referred to using the manufacturer's name e.g. "Durex."

In India they are called [[Nirodh]], a government-promoted brand, and are supplied free of cost to the majority of the rural and poor population. They are also called "helmet" or "Topi" (caps in Hindi) or KS (after a condom brandname KamaSutra).

Among the Indian Gay and Transexual Community it is called "Chocolates" as they are distributed widely for AIDS prevention.

Among Indian Muslims it is popularly known as "Parda" (veil or a curtain in Urdu).

In the Philippines, they are called "CD's" for the intentionally ambiguous effect. (when confused with compact discs that are also called CD's) They are also called "kapote" (Filipino term for raincoat).

==History==
[[Image:Condom 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A condom made from animal hide circa 1900]]
An Egyptian drawing of a condom being worn has been found to be 3,000 years old. It is unknown, however, if the Egyptian pictured wearing the device intended to use it for contraception, or for ritual purposes.<ref name=pp />

In 16th century Italy, Gabrielle Fallopius authored the first-known published description of  condom use for disease prevention. He recommended soaking cloth sheaths in a chemical solution and allowing them to dry prior to use.<!--
 --><ref name=pai>{{cite web | title = Special Topic: History of Condom Use | publisher = Population Action International | date = 2002 | url = http://www.populationaction.org/resources/publications/condomscount/HistoryOfCondoms.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

The oldest condoms found (rather than just pictures or descriptions) are from 1640, discovered in [[Dudley Castle]] in [[England]].  They were made of animal intestine, and it is believed they were used for [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] prevention.<ref name=pp />

In 19th century Japan, both leather condoms and condoms made of tortoise shells or horns were available.<ref name=pai />

The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1844, and the first rubber condom was produced in 1855.<!--
 --><ref name=billy>{{cite web | title = Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber | work = Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom | url = http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> These early rubber condoms were 1-2mm thick and had seams down the sides.<ref name=pai /> Although they were reusable, these early rubber condoms were also expensive.

Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the [[Comstock Law]] in 1873.  This law prohibited transport through the postal service of any instructional material or devices intended to prevent pregnancy. Condoms were available by prescription, although legally they were only supposed to be prescribed to prevent disease rather than pregnancy.<ref name=pp />  The Comstock Law remained in force until it was largely overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1936.

In 1912, a German named Julius Fromm developed a new manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into the raw rubber solution.  This enabled the production of thinner condoms with no seams.  Fromm's Act was the first branded line of condoms, and Fromms is still a popular line of condoms in Germany today.<ref name=billy />  By the 1930s, the manufacturing process had improved to produce single-use condoms almost as thin and inexpensive as those currently available.<ref name=pai />

Condoms were not made available to U.S. soldiers in [[World War I]], and a significant number of returning soldiers carried sexually transmitted infections. During [[World War II]], however, condoms were heavily promoted to soldiers, with one film exhorting ''"Don't forget — put it on before you put it in."''<ref name=pp /> In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of non-sexual uses for the devices:
*Tying a non-lubricated condom around the muzzle of the rifle barrel in order to prevent barrel fouling by keeping out detritus.<!--
 --><ref>Ambrose, Stephen. ''D-Day''</ref>
*Because long-distance bombers often did not have toilet facilities, condoms could be used to hold urine.  It was common practice to throw the filled condoms from the plane whilst at altitude over enemy territory.{{citation needed}}
*The [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] used condoms for a plethora of applications, from storing corrosive fuel additives and wire [[garrote]]s (with the T-handles removed) to holding the acid component of a self-destructing film canister, to finding use in improvised explosives.<ref>OSS Product Catalog, 1944</ref>
*[[Navy SEAL|Navy SEALs]] have used doubled condoms, sealed with neoprene cement, to protect non-electric firing assemblies for underwater demolitions - leading to the term "Dual Waterproof Firing Assemblies."<ref>Couch, D (2001). ''The Warrior Elite: The forging of SEAL Class 228''. ISBN 0-609-60710-3</ref>
*[[Espionage|Spies]] during the [[Cold_War|Cold War]] used condoms to protect ultra-miniature [[Minox|Minox]] cameras and film for covert storage and transport.{{citation needed}}

==Other uses==
Condoms excel as multipurpose containers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and will not arouse suspicion if found.  In addition to the onging military utilization begun during World War II ([[#History|above]]), other uses of condoms include:
*Condoms have been used to waterproof boxes of matches and kindling, often by hikers and campers.{{citation needed}} 
*Condoms can be used to hold water in emergency survival situations.<ref>http://photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00542b&tag=</ref> The British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] carry condoms as a method for carrying water in these emergencies.
**Furthermore, condoms are used by the SAS and other soldiers to keep gun barrels dry in dirty environments.{{fact}}
*Condoms have also been used in many cases to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[cocaine]] and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the rectum. These methods are very dangerous for if the condom breaks the drugs inside can cause an overdose.<ref>"<cite>A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund. He had a kilo of cocaine in his stomach.</cite>" [http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=2671&date=20051212 Smuggler hospitalised as cocaine condom bursts]</ref>
*In his book entitled ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', [[Douglas Adams]] reported having used a condom to protect a microphone he used to make an underwater recording.
