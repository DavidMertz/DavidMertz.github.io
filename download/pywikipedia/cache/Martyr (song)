'''"Martyr"''' is a future single by [[Depeche Mode]]. It is Depeche Mode's most recent non-album single, intended to promote the new compilation, ''[[The Best Of, Volume 1]]'', to be released on [[November 13]], [[2006]]. [http://www2.depeche-mode.com/home/article.php?article_id=81]  It is scheduled to be released on [[October 30]], [[2006]] in three formats, CD single, CD maxi and DVD single. 

The song, originally titled "Martyr for Love", is a well-known missing track from the ''[[Playing the Angel]]'' sessions. The song was mentioned on one of the [http://archives.depechemode.com/video/exclusives/fletchcam.html FletchCam] videos (where it can faintly be heard playing in the background), and has been mentioned in interviews. ''[[Playing the Angel]]'' programmer [[Dave McCracken]] has said that it did not make the album due to it being a bit poppier than the rest of the album.[http://www2.depeche-mode.com/home/article.php?article_id=24]  The single features a re-mix by [[Booka Shade]] among others.  [[Andrew Fletcher]] is reported to have said that two of the B-sides have been written by [[Dave Gahan]]. 

The video is being directed by Andreas Nilsson, who was reportedly hired because Dave Gahan was impressed by his video for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knife The Knife]'s "Silent Shout".[http://www.energylab.de/wordpress/?p=3481] The video is being made in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg Gothenberg], Sweden, and members of the group do not appear in it.
