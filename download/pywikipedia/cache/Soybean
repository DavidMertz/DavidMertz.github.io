The '''soybean''' ([[American English|U.S.]] and [[British English|UK]]) or '''soya bean''' ([[British English|UK]]) (''Glycine max'') is a species of [[legume]] native to [[East Asia|Eastern Asia]]. It is an [[annual plant]] that may vary in growth habit and height. It may grow prostrate, not growing higher than 20 cm (7.8 inches), or even stiffly erect up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in height. The pods, stems, and leaves are covered with fine brown or gray pubescence. The [[leaf|leaves]] are trifoliolate (sometimes with 5 leaflets), and the leaflets are 6-15 cm (2-6 inches) long and 2-7 cm (1-3 inches) broad; they fall before the seeds are mature. The small, inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white, pink or purple.  The [[fruit]] is a hairy [[legume|pod]] that grows in clusters of 3-5, with each pod 3-8 cm (1-3 inches) long and usually containing 2-4 (rarely more) [[seed]]s 5-11 mm in diameter.

Like [[maize|corn]] and some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty. It is a cultural variety (a [[cultigen]]) with a very large number of [[cultivar]]s. However, it is known that the progenitor of the modern soybean was a vine-like plant, that grew prone on the ground.

Beans are classed as [[pulses]] whereas soybeans are classed as [[oilseeds]]. The word soy is derived from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''[[shoyu]]'' (soy sauce/soya sauce).
== Physical characteristics ==  
Soybeans occur in various sizes, and in several [[husk|hull]] or seed coat colors, including black, brown, blue, yellow, and mottled. The hull of the mature bean is hard, water resistant, and protects the [[cotyledon]] and [[hypocotyl]] (or "germ") from damage. If the seed coat is cracked the seed will not [[germinate]]. The scar, visible on the seed coat, is called the hilum (colors include black, brown, buff, gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle, or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water.   
    
It is a remarkable fact that seeds such as soybeans, containing very high levels of [[soy protein]], can undergo [[desiccation]] yet survive and revive after water absorption. A.Carl Leopold, son of [[Aldo Leopold]], set out twenty years ago to answer this very question at the [[Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]] at [[Cornell University]]. Studying the survival of soybeans and corn he found each to have a range of soluble [[carbohydrate]]s protecting the seed's cell viability.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes =  | last = Blackman | first = SA | authorlink =  | coauthors = Obendorf RL, Leopold AC | date =  | year = 1992 | month = Sept | title = Maturation Proteins and Sugars in Desiccation Tolerance of Developing Soybean Seeds | journal = Plant Physiol. | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 225-30 | doi =  | id = {{PMC|1075542}} | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1075542 | format = 1.2M PDF, or scanned pages | accessdate = 2006-10-21 }}</ref> Patents were awarded to him in the early 1990s on techniques for protecting "biological membranes" and proteins in the dry state.

==Chemical composition of the seed==
The oil and protein content together account for about 60% of dry soybeans by weight; protein at 40% and oil at 20%. The remainder consists of 35% carbohydrate and about 5% ash. Soybean cultivars comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull, 90% [[cotyledons]] and 2% [[hypocotyl]] axis or germ. 

The majority of [[soy protein]] is a relatively heat-stable storage protein.  It is this heat-stability of the soy protein that enables soy food products requiring high temperature cooking, such as [[tofu]], soymilk and textured vegetable protein (soy flour) to be made.

The principal soluble [[carbohydrates]], saccharides, of  mature soybeans are the disaccharide [[sucrose]](range 2.5-8.2%), the trisaccharide [[raffinose]]( 0.1-1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule  connected to one molecule of [[galactose]], and the tetrasaccharide [[stachyose]](1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose.
While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect the  viability of the soybean seed from  desiccation{see above section on physical characteristics} they are not digestible sugars and therefore contribute to [[flatulence]] and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, etc.

Since soluble soy carbohydrates are found mainly in the [[whey]] and are broken down during fermentation, soy concentrate, [[soy protein]] isolates,  [[tofu]], soy sauce, and sprouted soybeans  are without flatus activity. On the other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, namely, encouraging indigenous [[bifidobacteria]] in the colon against [[putrefactive]] bacteria.

The insoluble  carbohydrates in soybeans consist of the complex polysaccharides [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[pectin]]. The  majority of soybean carbohydrates can be classed as belonging to [[dietary fiber]].

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Soybeanvarieties.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Varieties of soybeans are used for many purposes.]]

Soybeans are an important global crop, grown for oil and protein. The bulk of the crop is solvent extracted for vegetable oil and then defatted soy meal is used for animal feed. A very small proportion of the crop is consumed directly for food by humans. Soybean products, however, appear in a large variety of processed foods. 

Soybeans have been a crucial crop in eastern [[Asia]] since long before written records, and they are still a major crop in [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]] today. Soy was not actually used as a food item until they discovered fermentation techniques around 2000 years ago. Prior to fermented products such as [[soy sauce]], [[tempeh]], [[natto]], and [[miso]], soy was considered sacred for its use in crop rotation as a method of fixing nitrogen. The plants would be plowed under to clear the field for food crops.{{fact}} Soy was first introduced to [[Europe]] in the early 1700s and the [[United States]] in 1765, where it was first grown for hay. [[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote a letter in 1770 mentioning sending soybeans home from England. Soybeans did not become an important crop outside of Asia until about 1910. In America, soy was considered an industrial product only and not utilized as a food prior to the 1920's.

Cultivation is successful in climates with hot summers, with optimum growing conditions in mean temperatures of 20 °C to 30 °C (68°F to 86°F); temperatures of below 20 °C and over 40 °C (68 °F, 104 °F) retard growth significantly. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content. Soybeans, like most legumes perform [[nitrogen fixation]] by establishing a [[symbiotic]] relationship with the bacterium ''[[Rhizobia|Bradyrhizobium japonicum]]'' ([[synonymy|syn.]] ''Rhizobium japonicum''; Jordan 1982). However, for best results an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern crop [[cultivar]]s generally reach a height of around 1 m (3 ft), and take between 80-120 days from sowing to harvesting.

Soybeans are native to southeast Asia, but 45 percent of the world's soybean area, and 55 percent of production, is in the United States. The U.S. produced 75 million metric tons of soybeans in 2000, of which more than one-third was exported. Other leading producers are [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], China, and [[India]].

Environmental groups, such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], have reported that both soybean cultivation and the threat to increase soybean cultivation in Brazil is destroying huge areas of [[Amazon rainforest]] and encouraging [[deforestation]]. Besides destruction of the rainforest, it destroys unique [[biodiversity]] and causes a billion dollar's loss on [[technology]] from [[bionics]] revenue. American soil scientist, Dr. Andrew McClung, who first showed that the  infertile [[Cerrado]] region of Brazil could grow soybeans, was awarded the 2006 [[World Food Prize]] on October 19, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first = Susan|last = Lang|authorlink =|author = Lang, S|coauthors =|title = Cornell alumnus Andrew Colin McClung reaps 2006 World Food Prize|url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June06/World.Food.prize.ssl.html|format = |work = |publisher = Cornell University|pages = |page = |date = 2006-06-21|accessdate = 2006-10-21 |language = }}</ref>

The first research on soybeans in the United States was conducted by [[George Washington Carver]] at [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], but he decided it was too exotic a crop for the poor black farmers of the South so he turned his attention to peanuts.  [[Peanut]]s, soybeans, or other [[legume]] plants that would replenish the soil with [[nitrogen]] and [[mineral]]s were planted for two years and then [[cotton]] on the third year. A two-year rotation system alternating [[maize]] instead is also a possibility.

===Genetic Modification===
Soybeans are one of the "[[Biotechnology|biotech]] food" crops that are being [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified]], and GMO soybeans are being used in an increasing number of products. [[Monsanto]] is the world's leader in genetically modified soy for the commercial market. In 1995, Monsanto introduced "[[Roundup Ready]]" (RR) soybeans that have had a copy of a [[gene]] from the bacterium, ''Agrobacterium'' sp. strain CP4, inserted, by means of a [[gene gun]], into its genome that allows the [[transgenic]] plant to survive being sprayed by this non-selective, herbicide, glyphosate. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, kills conventional soybeans. The bacterial gene is EPSP (= 5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase.  Soybean also has a version of this gene, but the soybean version is sensitive to glyphosate, while the CP4 version is not.<ref>Padgette SR, Kolacz KH, Delannay X, Re DB, LaVallee BJ, Tinius CN, Rhodes WK, Otero YI, Barry GF, Eichholz DA, Peschke VM, Nida DL, Taylor NB, Kishore GM (1995) Development, identification, and characterization of a glyphosate-tolerant soybean line. Crop Sci 35:1451-1461</ref>

RR soybeans allow a farmer to reduce tillage or even to sow the seed directly into an unplowed field, known as 'no-till' or conservation tillage.  No-till agriculture has many advantages, greatly reducing soil erosion and creating better wildlife habitat;<ref>Conservation Technology Information Center, http://www.conservationinformation.org/</ref> it also saves fossil fuels, and sequesters CO2, a greenhouse effect gas.<ref>Brookes G and Barfoot P (2005)  GM crops: The global economic and environmental impact-- the first nine years 1996-2004.  AgBioForum 8:187-195</ref>

In 1997, about 8% of all soybeans cultivated for the commercial market in the United States were genetically modified. In 2006, the figure was 89%.  As with other "Roundup Ready" crops, concern is expressed over damage to [[biodiversity]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Liu |first= KeShun |title= Soybeans : Chemistry, Technology, and Utilization |url= |format= Hardcover |accessdate= |edition= |date=1997-05-01 |publisher= Springer |location= |language= |id= ISBN 0-8342-1299-4 |doi = |pages= 532 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = }}</ref>  However, the RR gene has been bred into so many different soybean cultivars that the genetic modification itself has not resulted in any decline of genetic diversity.<ref>Sneller CH (2003) Impact of transgenic genotypes and subdivision on diversity within elite North American soybean germplasm. Crop Sci 43:409-414.</ref>

==Uses==
Soybeans can be broadly classified as "vegetable" (garden) or field (oil) types. Vegetable types cook more easily, have a mild nutty flavor, better texture, are larger in size, higher in protein, and lower in oil than field types. [[Tofu]] and [[soymilk]] producers prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans originally brought to the United States in the late 1930s. The "garden" cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting because they have a tendency for the pods to shatter on reaching maturity.

Among the legumes, the soybean, also classed as an oilseed, is pre-eminent for its high (38-45%) [[protein]] content as well as its high (20%) oil content. Soybeans are the leading agricultural export in the United States. The bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil production, with the high-protein defatted and "toasted" soy meal used as livestock feed. A smaller percentage of soybeans are used directly for human consumption.

Soybeans may be boiled whole in their green pod and served with [[edible salt|salt]], under the Japanese name ''[[edamame]]'' ([[IPA chart for English|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[eda-maa-me]}}). Soybeans prepared this way are a popular local snack in [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], where, as in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] the bean and products made from the bean ([[miso]], [[natto]], [[tofu]], [[douchi]], doenjang, ganjang and others) are a popular part of the diet.  In [[Korean cuisine]], soybean sprouts (kongnamul (hangul:콩나물)) are also used in a variety of dishes.

The beans can be processed in a variety of ways. Common forms of soy (or ''soya'') include soy meal, soy [[flour]], "[[soy milk]]", [[tofu]], [[textured vegetable protein]] (TVP, which is made into a wide variety of [[vegetarian food]]s, some of them intended to imitate [[meat]]), [[tempeh]], soy [[lecithin]] and [[soybean oil]]. Soybeans are also the primary ingredient involved in the production of [[soy sauce]] (or ''shoyu'').

[[Image:Soybeans.jpg|thumb|right|Soybeans grow throughout Asia and North and South America.]]


[[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) is among the largest processors of soybeans and soy products. ADM along with [[DOW]], [[DuPont]] and [[Monsanto]] support the industry trade associations [[United Soybean Board]] (USB) and [[Soyfoods Association of North America]] (SANA). These trade associations have increased the consumption of soy products dramatically in recent years.

The dramatic increase is largely credited to the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s (FDA) approval of [[health claims]] for soy which very likely is unfounded (see below: [[#Reduce Cholesterol?]]). Since the bulk of the soy grown in the US is GMO variety the chief beneficiaries of the increase are the biotech seed companies. Dr. [[Jane E. Henney]] who was the FDA commissioner at the time, now sits on the board of biotech giant [[Astra Zeneca]]. Many top agency officials from the [[Bush]] Administration, have been under criticism for close ties to industry and possible financial conflicts of interest. The former [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Secretary of Agriculture, [[Daniel Robert Glickman]], also left to accept seats on the boards of soy related companies including [[Hain Foods]].   

From 2001 to 2004, food manufacturers in the US introduced over 1600 new foods with soy as an ingredient, averaging 400 new products per year, according to the [[Mintel]]’s [[Global New Products Database]].

From 1992 to 2003, soyfoods sales have experienced a 15% [[compound annual growth rate]], increasing from $300 million to $3.9 billion over 11 years, as new soyfood categories have been introduced, soyfoods have been repositioned in the market place, and new customers have selected soy for health and philosophical reasons. Dramatic growth followed the FDA approval of a health claim linking soy with heart disease reduction.

===Oil=== 
In processing soybeans for [[oil]] extraction and subsequent soy flour production, selection of high quality, sound, clean, dehulled yellow soybeans is very important. Soybeans having a dark colored seed coat, or even beans with a dark hilum will inadvertently leave dark specks in the flour, an undesirable factor when used in food products. All commercial soybeans in the United States are yellow or yellow brown.

To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, rolled into flakes and solvent-extracted with commercial [[hexane]]. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]]. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated, are exported abroad, sold as "vegetable oil," or end up in a wide variety of processed foods. The remaining soybean husks are used mainly as animal feed.

The major [[unsaturated]] fatty acids in soybean oil [[triglycerides]] are [[Alpha-linolenic acid|linolenic acid]],C18:3; [[linoleic acid]], C-18:2; and [[oleic acid]],C-18:1. Soybean oil has a relatively high proportion, 7-10%, of oxidation prone linolenic acid, which is an undesirable  property for continuous service, such as in a restaurant. Two companies, [[Monsanto]] and [[DuPont]]/[[Bunge Limited|Bunge]] in 2004 introduced low linolenic, (C18:3; cis-9, cis-12, cis-15 octadecatrienoic acid) [[Roundup Ready]] soybeans: the former introduced a new soybean seed variety called "Vistive" and the latter Pioneer seed variety 93M20. Dupont/Bunge is marketing its low linolenic soybean oil under the brand name [[Nutrium]]. The idea is that reducing or eliminating the triple unsaturated fatty acid, linolenic, also eliminates the tendency to be a  paint-like [[drying oil]] producing noticeable rancidity. In the past [[hydrogenation]] reduced the unsaturation in linolenic acid but produced the unnatural [[trans]] fatty acid [[trans fat]] configuration whereas in nature the configuration is [[cis]].

One unintended consequence of moving away from partially hydrogenated soybean oil (containing trans fatty acids) is the switch  to partially saturated [[palm oil]] for  frying, especially in China. This fact is resulting in a severe threat of deforestation to pristine forests in Indonesia followed by the planting of [[oil palm]] plantations.<ref>

[http://www.cspinet.org/palmoilreport/index.html Center for Science in the Public Interest]</ref>

In the 2002-2003 growing season, 30.6 million [[metric ton]]s of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants.<ref>[[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Statistics 2004. Table 3-51.</ref>

=== Meal ===
Soybean meal, the material remaining after solvent extraction of soybean flakes, with a 50% [[soy protein]] content, toasted (a misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam), and ground, in a [[hammer mill]], provided the energy for the American revolution, beginning in the 1930s, of growing farm animals such as [[poultry]] and [[domestic pig|swine]] on an industrial scale; and more recently the [[aquaculture]] of [[catfish]].

===Flour===
Soy flour refers to defatted soybeans where special care was taken during desolventizing (not toasted) in order to minimize [[denaturation]] of the protein to retain a high Nitrogen Solubility Index (NSI), for uses such as extruder texturizing (TVP). It is the starting material for  production of soy concentrate and soy protein isolate.
*Defatted soy flour, is obtained from solvent extracted flakes, and contains less than 1% oil.
*Full-fat soy flour, is made from unextracted, dehulled beans, and contains about 18% to 20% oil. Due to its high oil content a specialized Alpine Fine Impact Mill must be used  for grinding rather than the more common  hammermill.
*Low fat soy flour, is made by adding back some oil to defatted soy flour. The lipid content varies according to specifications, usually between 4.5% and 9%.
*High fat soy flour, is produced by adding back soybean oil to defatted flour, at the level of 15%.
*Lecithinated soy flour, is made by adding soybean [[lecithin]] to defatted, low fat or high fat soy flours to increase their dispersibility and impart emulsifying properties. The lecithin content varies  up to 15%.

===Infant formula===
[[Infant formula]]s based on soy are used by lactose-intolerant babies; and for babies that are allergic to human milk proteins and cow milk proteins. The formulas are sold in powdered, ready to feed, or concentrated liquid forms.

It has been recommended internationally by pediatric associations that soy formulas not be used as the primary or sole source of nutrition for infants due to the high risk of several deficiencies including calcium and zinc.

===Substitute for existing products===
Many traditional [[dairy product]]s have been imitated using processed soybeans, and imitation products such as "[[soy milk]]," "soy [[yogurt]]" and "soy [[cream cheese]]" are readily available in most [[supermarket]]s. These imitation products are derived from extensive processing to produce a texture and appearance similar to the real dairy-based ones. Soy milk does not contain significant amounts of [[calcium]], since the high calcium content of soybeans is bound to the insoluble constituents and remains in the [[soy pulp|pulp]]. Many manufacturers of soy milk now sell calcium-enriched products as well.

===Other products ===
Soybeans are also used in industrial products including oils, [[soap]], [[cosmetics]], [[resin]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[ink]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[clothing]], and [[biodiesel]].  Soybeans are also used as fermenting stock to make a brand of [[vodka]].

[[Henry Ford]] promoted the soybean, helping to develop uses for it both in food and in industrial products, even demonstrating auto body panels made of soy-based plastics. Ford's interest lead to 2 bushels of soybeans being used in each Ford car as well as products like the first commercial [[soy milk]], ice cream and all-vegetable non-dairy whipped topping.

The Ford development of  so called soy-based plastics was based on the addition of  soybean flour and wood flour to [[phenolformaldehyde plastics]].

In 1931, Ford hired the chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert in a  quest for artificial silk. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a [[formaldehyde]] bath which was given the name [[Azlon]] by the Federal Trade Commission. Pilot plant production of Azlon reached 5000 pounds per day in 1940, but never reached the commercial market. However, Henry Ford did have the now famous suit made for him of Azlon which he wore on special occasions.
The winning textile fiber in the search for artificial silk was, of course, [[Nylon]]: a synthetic [[polyamide]] or artificial protein discovered in 1935 by Wallace H.Carothers at [[DuPont]].
[Soybeans and Soybean Products, Vol.II,edited by K.H. Markley,1951]

Today,  very high quality textile fibers are made commercially from okara or [[soy pulp]], a by- product of [[tofu]] production.

==Nutrition==
===Protein===
{{main|soy protein}}
Soybeans are a source of [[complete protein]].<ref>http://www.truestarhealth.com/members/cm_archives12ML3P1A8.html The Scoop on Protein Powders By Sofia Segounis, Nutritionist </ref> A complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the [[essential amino acid]]s that must be provided to the [[human body]] because of the body's inability to [[Synthesis|synthesize]] them. For this reason, soy is important to many [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and [[Veganism|vegans]]. However, the phrase complete protein can be a bit misleading since proteins vary in their protein values. Whole eggs have a biological value of 100 versus 96 for whole soybeans, and  71 for highly processed isolated soy protein. [[Soy protein]] is similar to that of other legume seeds, but has the highest yield per square meter of growing area, and is the least expensive source of dietary protein.

The original Protein Efficiency Ratio [[PER]] method of measuring soy protein quality was found to be flawed for humans because the young rats used in the study have higher relative requirements for sulfur-containing amino acids. As such the analytical method that is universally recognized by the FAO/WHO (1990) as well as the [[FDA]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[United Nations University]] (UNU) and the [[National Academy of Sciences]] when judging the quality of protein  is [[PDCAAS|Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]], as it is viewed as accurately measuring the correct relative nutritional value of animal and vegetable sources of protein in the diet.<ref>FAO/WHO (1991) Protein Quality Evaluation Report of Joint FAO/WHO Expert 
Consultation, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO Food
and Nutrition Paper No. 51, Rome.</ref><ref>Schaafsma, G. (2000) 'The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. ''Journal of Nutrition'' 130, 1865S-1867S</ref> 
Based on this method, soy protein is considered to have a similar equivalent in protein quality to animal proteins. Egg white has a score of 1.00, beef 0.92, isolated soy protein 0.92, and  soy concentrate 0.99.   The digestibility of some soyfoods are as follows: steamed soybeans 65.3%, tofu 92.7%, soy "milk" 92.6%, soy protein isolate 93–97%.<ref>{{cite book |last= Liu |first= KeShun |title= Soybeans : Chemistry, Technology, and Utilization |url= |format= Hardcover |accessdate= |edition= |date=1997-05-01 |publisher= Springer |location= |language= |id= ISBN 0-8342-1299-4 |doi = |pages= 532 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = Citation on p.391 from Watanabe, et al., 1971 (in Japanese) }}</ref> 

Another measure of a protein's use in nutrition is the [[Biological Value]] scale. The Biological Value method, which dates back to 1911 relies on nitrogen retention as an indicator of protein quality.<ref name="1972bv"/> 

According to the 1972 publication ''Soybeans: Chemistry and Technology'', isolated soy protein has an average biological value of 71, whole soybeans 96, soy milk 91, defatted soy flour 81.<ref name="1972bv"/>

===Vitamins and minerals===
[[Image:Trader joes edamame.jpg|thumb|right|Toasted soybeans]]
Of any studied legume, whole soybeans have the highest levels of [[phytic acid]], an [[organic acid]] and mineral [[chelation|chelator]] present in many plant tissues, especially [[bran]] and [[seed]]s, which binds to certain ingested minerals: calcium, magnesium, iron, and especially zinc&mdash;in the intestinal tract, and reduces the amount the body assimilates. For people with a particularly low intake of essential minerals, especially young children and those in [[developing countries]], this effect can be undesirable. However, dietary mineral chelators help prevent over-mineralization of joints, blood vessels, and other parts of the body, which is most common in older persons. 

Consumption of soy may also reduce the risk of [[colon cancer]], possibly due to the presence of [[sphingolipid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Symolon H, Schmelz E, Dillehay D, Merrill A | title = Dietary soy sphingolipids suppress tumorigenesis and gene expression in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-treated CF1 mice and ApcMin/+ mice. | journal = J Nutr | volume = 134 | issue = 5 | pages = 1157-61 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15113963 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/5/1157 }}</ref>

==The role of soyfoods in disease prevention==
===Omega-3 fatty acids===
[[Omega-3 fatty acids]], for example, [[Alpha-linolenic acid|linolenic acid]] C18-3, all cis, 9,12,15 octadecatrienoic acid (where the omega-3 refers to carbon number 3 counting from the  hydrocarbon tail whereas C-15 refers to carbon number 15 counting from the carboxyl acid head) are special fat components that benefit many body functions. For instance, they inhibit blood clotting. Soybean oil is one of the only common vegetable oils that contains a significant amount of omega-3s; others include [[canola]], walnut, and [[flax]].

===Isoflavones===
Soybeans also contain [[isoflavone]]s, a type of [[phytoestrogen]], that are considered by some nutritionists and physicians to be useful in the prevention of cancer and by others to be carcinogenic and endocrine disruptive. Soy's high levels of isoflavone phytoestrogens, being up to 3mg/g dry weight, are the subject of heated debate and controversy. They are also blamed for some [[thyroid]] and reproductive health problems. Isoflavones are [[polyphenol]] compounds, produced primarily by beans and other legumes, including [[peanut]]s and [[chickpea]]s.

Isolated phytoestrogen-like isoflavones are an active research area. A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences studied the effect of the isolated soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein (commonly found in dietary supplements and infant formulas) on adult mice with their ovaries removed. The study found the mice had thymic and immune system abnormalities and reduction in immune system activity. The article suggests further research into human phytoestrogen response is warranted.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/11/7616 "The phytoestrogen genistein induces thymic and immune changes: A human health concern?"] Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences May 28, 2002</ref>

From a website that advertises [[saliva]] [[pH]] [[alkalinity]] as a form of [[cancer]] protection:<ref>[http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/salivaphtest.htm Alkalize for health]</ref>

"Researchers Daniel Doerge and Daniel Sheehan, two of the FDA's experts on soy, signed a letter of protest, which points to studies that show a link between soy and health problems in certain animals. The two say they tried in vain to stop the FDA approval of soy because it could be misinterpreted as a broader general endorsement beyond benefits for the heart."<ref>[http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/Lsoy2.htm FDA Scientists Against Soy].

The FDA has since publicly rejected these claims due to lack of evidence and cite numerous studies that uphold the health benefits of soy foods.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2000/300_soy.html Soy: Health Claims for Soy Protein, Questions About Other Components]</ref>

===Reduce cholesterol?===
In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine (Vol. 333, No. 5) published a report from the [[University of Kentucky]] entitled, "Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Soy Protein Intake on Serum Lipids." It was financed by the PTI division of DuPont,"The Solae Co."<ref>[http://www.solae.com/ The Solae Company]</ref> [[St. Louis, Missouri]], a soy producer and marketer. This meta-analysis concluded that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein [[LDL]] (bad cholesterol) and triglyceride concentrations. However, High Density Lipoprotein [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]](good cholesterol) did not increase by a significant amount. Soy [[phytoestrogens]] ([[isoflavones]]: genistein and daidzein) [[adsorbed]] onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this research PTI, in 1998, filed a petition with FDA for a health claim that soy protein may reduce cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. It should be noted that only subjects with serum cholesterol of 250mg/dl and higher showed any improvement in the study.

The FDA granted this health claim for soy: "25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease." One serving, (1 cup or 240 mL) of soy milk, for instance, contains 6 or 7 grams of soy protein. Solae resubmitted their original petition, asking for a more vague health claim, after their original was challenged and highly criticized. Solae also submitted a petition for a health claim that soy can help prevent cancer. They quickly withdrew the petition for lack of evidence and after more than 1000 letters of protest were received.

In January, 2006 an [[American Heart Association]] review (in the journal Circulation) of a decade long study of soy protein benefits casts doubt on the FDA allowed "Heart Healthy" claim for soy protein. This review of the literature compared soy protein and its component isoflavones with casein (isolated milk protein), wheat protein, and mixed animal proteins.<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/113/7/1034#SEC2Soy Protein, Isoflavones, and Cardiovascular Health: An American Heart Association Science Advisory for Professionals From the Nutrition Committee -- Sacks et al. 113 (7): 1034 -- Circulation]</ref> The review panel also found that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post menopause "hot flashes" in women and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help prevent cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate is in question. Thus, soy isoflavone supplements in food or pills is not recommended. Among the conclusions the authors state, "In contrast, soy products such as tofu, soy butter, soy nuts, or some soy burgers should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat. Using these and other soy foods to replace foods high in animal protein that contain saturated fat and cholesterol may confer benefits to cardiovascular health."<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/113/7/1034#SEC5 Soy Protein, Isoflavones, and Cardiovascular Health: An American Heart Association Science Advisory for Professionals From the Nutrition Committee -- Sacks et al. 113 (7): 1034 -- Circulation]</ref>

==Soy controversy==
===Phytoestrogen===
Soybeans contain [[isoflavones]] called [[genistein]] and [[daidzein]]. Isoflavones (isoflavonoids) are one of two primary groups of [[phytoestrogens]], plant-based estrogen mimicking organic chemicals with antioxidant--free radical scavengers--properties. The other group is [[lignan]]. Plant [[lignans]] associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites. The best source of lignans is flax seed. Soybeans are a significant source of mammalian lignan precursor [[secoisolariciresinol]]  containing 13-273 µg/100 g dry weight.<ref>[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/130/3/658S Phytoestrogens and Prostate Disease -- Adlercreutz et al. 130 (3): 658 -- Journal of Nutrition]</ref>
Another phytoestrogen, in the human diet, with estrogen activity is [[coumestans]] but much less well studied which are found in beans, split-peas, with the best sources being alfalfa, clover, and soybean sprouts. [[Coumesterol]], an isoflavone [[coumarin]] derivative is the only coumestan in foods.<ref>de Kleijn MJ, van der Schouw YT, Wilson PW, Grobbee DE, Jacques PF. Dietary intake of phytoestrogens is associated with a favorable metabolic cardiovascular risk profile in postmenopausal U.S. women: the Framingham study. J Nutr. 2002;132(2):276-282.

===Phytoestrogen in men===
Because of the phytoestrogen content, some studies indicate that there is a correlation between a soybean-rich diet and a decrease in the level of [[testosterone]] in men, although these findings are controversial.<ref>[http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do?site=MensHealth&channel=health&category=other.diseases.ailments&conitem=43f999edbbbd201099edbbbd2010cfe793cd____ Soy?

A study carried out at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast linked soy to male infertility, including damage of reproductive capability already caused during childhood.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3513607.stm Soya 'link' to male infertility. The humble soya bean may play a role in the problem of male infertility, a team of researchers in Belfast has found.]</ref> The study also points out that "soy is not just consumed by vegetarians, it is contained in a lot of everyday processed foods."

===Phytoestrogen in women===
A 2001 study determined that women with current or past breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth when taking soy products.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?itool=abstractplus&db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=abstractplus&list_uids=11573864 Ann Pharmacother. 2001 Sep;35(9):1118-21.Effects of soy phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein on breast cancer growth. de Lemos ML. Provincial Systemic Therapy Program, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.]</ref>

A 2006 study reviewed the relationship with soy and breast cancer. To summarize, the research recommendation is that the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue needs to be evaluated at the cellular level in women at high risk for breast cancer.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16985246&query_hl=7&itool=pubmed_docsum J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Sep 20;98(18):1275-84.Addressing the soy and breast cancer relationship: review, commentary, and workshop proceedings.

===Phytoestrogen in infant formula===
There are some studies that state that a phytoestrogen in soy can lead to alterations in the proliferation and migration of intestinal cells.  The effects of these alterations are unknown.<ref>[http://www.ehponline.org/realfiles/docs/2005/113-5/forum.html ''Read Heading Under:'' '''Sour News for Soy Formula?''']</ref><ref>[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/6/1303 Genistein at a Concentration Present in Soy Infant Formula Inhibits Caco-2BBe Cell Proliferation by Causing G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest -- Chen and Donovan 134 (6): 1303 -- Journal of Nutrition]</ref> However, some studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula.<ref>[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/5/1220S Safety of Soy-Based Infant Formulas Containing Isoflavones: The Clinical Evidence -- Merritt and Jenks 134 (5): 1220S -- Journal of Nutrition]</ref> Other studies conclude that more research is needed to answer the question of what effect phytoestrogens have on infants.<ref>PMID 14599051</ref><ref>PMID 15189112</ref>

===Allergens===
{{see|Soy allergy}}
With the increased use of soybean in western diet comes also a danger of food allergies. About 8% of children in the USA are allergic to soybean proteins. The major soy allergen has been identified by scientists at [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. Both [[transgenic]] and  conventional  soybean varieties without the allergenic protein have been prepared, and hopefully will soon reach the market. This will be particularly important for preparation of baby formulas, since dual allergy to both milk and soy proteins is not uncommon. Soya allergy, typically, will manifest itself approximately a day after consumption of the beans. Common symptoms are [[urticaria]], rash, itching, and redness of the skin.<ref>[http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/Soy%20Allergens.html ''Nexus Magazine''] August-September, 2004; The Hidden Dangers of Soy Allergens by Kaayla T.

===Health food stores and soy===

Soy consumption has been popularized by natural food companies and the soy industry's aggressive marketing campaign in various magazines, television ads and in health food markets. Research has been conducted examining the validity of the beneficial health claims with regard to the increase in consumption of soybeans which mimic hormonal activity. A practice guideline published in the journal ''Circulation'' questions the efficacy and safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of the breast, endometrium, and prostate (although the same study also concludes that  soy in some foods should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health) and does not recommend usage of isoflavone supplements in food or pills.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes =  | last = Sacks | first = FM | authorlink =  | coauthors = Lichtenstein A, Van Horn L, et. al | date =  | year = 2006 | month = Feb | title = Soy protein, isoflavones, and cardiovascular health: an American Heart Association Science Advisory for professionals from the Nutrition Committee. | journal = Circulation | volume = 113 | issue = 7 | pages = 1034-44 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.171052 | id = PMID 16418439 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/113/7/1034 | format =  | accessdate = 2006-10-21}}</ref>
