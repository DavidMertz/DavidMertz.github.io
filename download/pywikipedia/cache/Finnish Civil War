The '''Finnish Civil War''' was a part of the [[First World War]] ([[1914]]-[[1918]]) and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The Civil War was fought from the end of January until half of May [[1918]], between the "Reds" ''(punaiset),'' i.e. [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]  and the "Whites" ''(valkoiset),'' i.e. forces commanded by the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Senate of Finland|Senate]]. The Reds were supported by the [[Soviet Union]]. The Whites got military assistance from the [[German Empire]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] volunteers. The Reds lost the war and the Whites were the winners. In addition, the hegemony of Russia was diminished in Finland. However, the country was bound to the German Empire due to the war. Finland became an independent, democratic republic after the German Empire lost in the First World War.

[[Finns]] have many names for this conflict: ''vapaussota'' ("War of Liberty"), ''kansalaissota'' or ''sisällissota'' ("Civil War"), ''luokkasota'' ("Class War"), ''punakapina'' ("Red Rebellion"), ''torpparikapina'' ("Crofters' Rebellion"), ''veljessota'' ("the war between brothers") and even ''vallankumous'' ("Revolution"). Present-day historians point out that all of these different names have their merits, although their [[propagandist]] charges differ. The most neutral names for the war are: "The Civil War" and  "The War of the Year 1918" <ref>Haapala 1993, Manninen 1993, Ylikangas 1993c, Lackman 2000</ref>. The Civil War has been the most controversial and emotionally loaded event in the history of modern [[Finland]]. 

== Background ==
In a large view the main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was the First World War and its detrimental effects on the Russian Empire, finally leading to revolution and a total collapse of the nation. Finland as a part of Russia was closely connected to the turmoil and furthermore to the war between Germany and Russia. Both empires had  political and military interests in Finland. In a more local view the background of the conflict between the Finns can be traced to political polarization within the Finnish society due to undemocratic power of the [[Estates of the realm|estates]]. The Finnish  people had been divided in two main parts, which had a very different economical, social and political status. On the other hand a crisis between Imperial Russia and the [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] commenced in [[1889]] as an outcome of Russian [[Pan-Slavism]] with the attempted [[Russification of Finland]], named as "the first period of oppression 1899-1905". As one consequence, [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland's army]] was abolished <ref>Upton 1980, Alapuro 1988</ref>.

[[Image:Peasants in finland.jpg|thumb|270px|Peasants on the field. Propertyless peasants and agrarian workers were a large group of the Finns, who had no political influence in the political system run by the [[Estates of the realm|estates]].]]

Until then, due to the broad autonomy, the Finno-Russian relations had been exceptionally peaceful and steady compared to the other parts of the Russian Empire. As this policy collapsed, both the Left and the Right started to radicalize and at first opposed the Imperial system together. The Rightist radicalization was in response to attempts at Russian cultural and constitutional hegemony, and would ultimately lead to [[Finnish Jäger troops|covert collaboration]] with [[Imperial Germany]], which had emerged as a new [[Great Power]] in the [[Baltic region]] after its [[1871]] unification <ref>Upton 1980, Lackman 2000</ref>.

Owing to the deviation within the Finnish society, estate vs. common people,  the [[Leftist]] radicalization started soon to focus on social problems also. This reaction was caused by the rapid growth of Finnish population and emergence of industrial and agrarian workers and propertyless [[peasant]]ry without land of their own. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had started to spread to Finland, later however than in the Western Europe (1800-1850). Therefore, at least some of the social problems caused by industrialism could be diminished by learning from the first experiences, e.g. in England. As a result the social conditions, income and self-confidence of the workers enhanced slowly but consistedly between 1880-1914. However, even if the standard of living among the common people rose, the rift between [[wealth|rich]] and [[poverty|poor]] clearly widened as trade profits increased markedly <ref>Haapala 1986 and 1995</ref>.

The Finnish labour movement was born in the end of the nineteenth century from basis of  folk and religious movements and had a "Finnish national, working class-orientated" character. The final breakthrough of the movement in the society occurred without major confrontations as tensions during Russia's failed [[Russo-Japanese War|war against Japan]] led to a [[general strike]] in [[1905]] in the empire. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, exceptionally broad [[universal suffrage]] and parliamentarism was introduced to Finland. This soon led to near 50% turnouts for the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]], but no improvements for their voters, as the true function and power of the new Parliament was prevented during 1908-1917 by the actions of the Russian [[Tsar]] (in his role as [[Grand Duke]] of Finland), who had regained his might after the crisis of 1905-1906 <ref>Alapuro 1988, Haapala 1995</ref>. 

=== The February Revolution (1917) ===
{{Seealso|February Revolution}}
[[Image:General Strike Helsinki 1917.jpg|thumb|220px|On strike in Helsinki, 1917. Workers demanded food and a complete shifting of legislative power from the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]] to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]].]]

A renewed attempt of russification, called  "the second period of oppression 1908-1917" began soon after the "days of freedom" in 1905-1906, continuing until the Russian [[February Revolution]] in [[1917]]. The Russian [[Tsar]] was dethroned on [[March 15]] and the [[personal union]] between Finland and Russia ceased. The main reason for the collapse of  the Russian Empire was  a domestic crises caused by the war-weariness and defeat in the battles against the German army in the First World War. The Tsar's power was transferred to The Russian [[Duma]] and [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]], which was non-socialistic. The revolt in Russia offered the Finnish Parliament true political power for the first time and the field was open for independent Finland, new democratic development in the society and increasing economical possibilities. Unfortunately, the social deviation and the heritage of the "ancient regime"  led to severe battle of power between Social Democrats and Conservatives. Socialists tried to both retain the already achieved rights and rapidly accomplish a marked influence in the society. Conservatives had fear of losing part of the long-term status of social and economical power. Finally, the development during the year 1917 caused a destruction of the Finnish state and society and an economical, political and military crisis <ref>Upton 1980, Alapuro 1988, Haapala 1995</ref>. 

The original and "legal" form of autonomy was returned to the Finns in March 1917 after the February Revolution. Social Democratic party had gained an [[absolute majority]] in the [[Parliament of Finland]] after the general elections of [[1916]]. Therefore, the new [[Senate of Finland|Finland's Senate]]  was formed by [[Oskari Tokoi]], [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrat]] and [[labor union|trade Union]] leader (the first Social Democratic prime-minister in the world). In theory the Tokoi' senate was in the 1917 conditions an exceptionally broad coalition-[[cabinet]] including six socialists and six non-socialists. However, in practice the senate appeared to be a weak cabinet. It was not able to solve any major local Finnish problems as the main political groups, neither on the Left nor on the Right, accepted any compromises with their opponents. Furthermore, the most experienced politicians of the parties did not want to join the cabinet. The Tokoi's Senate had to deal with several major problems during 1917. Large scale strikes spread throughout the country in industry and agriculture since April 1917, aiming at eight-hour working time and higher salaries. There was also a lack of food products (mainly cereals, deficit caused by the World War) and [[unemployment]] was increasing as a result of decreasing industrial production in the country due to the chaos in Russia. In addition to a slow but consistent increase in the standard of living of the Finnish workers during 1880-1914, the First World War had initiated a marked economical growth, which enhanced income of the working people during 1915-1916. All this collapsed due to the Russian revolution and a marked uncertanty spread among the common people. Still, the most important factor decreasing the authority of the state organizations during the Finnish crisis of 1917 was a more or less spontaneous transfer of political power to the street level i.e. mass meetings, protests, strike organizations and street councils established by workers and common soldiers <ref>Upton 1980,. Alapuro 1988, Haapala 1995</ref>.

A major factor in the fight for power between the Left and Right was the Tokoi Senate's bill, the so-called "Power Act", enacted by the Parliament in July [[1917]]. The Act contained a political plan by the Social Democrats to markedly increase the power of the Parliament having socialist majority.  In addition, it was an attempt to enhance independence of Finland as the bill restricted Russia's influence on domestic Finnish matters. The socialists carried out their plan in co-operation with the Russian Bolsheviks led by [[V.I. Lenin]], who planned a revolt against the Provisional Government in July 1917. Both the Finnish Conservatives and the [[Russian Provisional Government]] opposed the "Power Act" as it would decrease their political power. Finally, non-socialists won the battle; Lenin was defeated during the "July days", the Senate's bill was not accepted by the Russian Government, more army troops were sent to Finland and  in co-operation with the Finnish Right the Parliament was dissolved and new elections were announced. Subsequently, the Left lost their [[absolute majority]] in the Parliament in October 1917. This altered the political role of the labour movement. Until then it had mainly struggled for new rights, position and benefits for its members. Now the movement had to defend and maintain the achievements it had gained earlier <ref>Enckell 1956, Upton 1980, Alapuro 1988, Keränen 1992</ref>.  

Finland's autonomy had been restored by the Provisional Government of Russia, but in the process the [[police]] force was virtually abolished in the country. In the spring of 1917, both on the Left and on the Right, the general uncertanty in the country induced local formation of unarmed groups for controlling the order in the society. Later, in summer and especially in autumn 1917, in the situation of political frustration, connected with the battle of power, the collapse of the Finnish Parliament and breakdown of the society, the groups were reformed to resemble armed military troops. The Protection Guards (later [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]]) were organized by leaders of the local societies, usually Conservative academics, industrialists and major landowners, while the Worker's Security Guards (later [[Red Guards]]) were often collectively invited through their local party sections and the labor union. The birth of two separate, competing armed forces in Finland was one of the main factors leading to the final collapse of the Finnish society and establishment of  a "dual power"  and "multiple sovereignty"  often preceding Civil Wars <ref>Upton 1980, Lappalainen 1981, Salkola 1985, Alapuro 1988, Manninen 1993, Haapala 1995</ref>.

=== The October Revolution (1917) ===
{{Seealso|October Revolution}}
[[Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] [[October Revolution]] on [[November 7]] transferred the political power in Russia to the radical, left-wing socialists and Soviet-Russia was born. Enthusiasm rose in Berlin, Germany also, as the German "East Policy" had finally started to effect the warfare. The German Warlords had gotten caught in a heavy and exhausting war between two major frontlines, in the west and in the east. The main idea of the Germans was to try to arrange marked disorder or even another revolution in Russia in order to force Russians to search for peace. Therefore, it was the German leaders who sheltered the journey of Lenin and his comrades from Switzerland to St. Petersburg in April 1917. Lenin had openly expressed the need for revolution inside Russia and then for peace with Germany. In other words; V.I. Lenin was the most powerful weapon that Germany could ever launch on the Russian territory in the First World War <ref>Keränen 1992, Lackman 2000</ref>.

In Finland the polarization and mutual fear between the Left wing and the Right wing had increased dramatically since the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament. In the general elections of October 1917 the Right reached majority in the Parliament and a purely non-Socialist cabinet was appointed. Social Democrats began to plan how to regain the governmental power lost in October. Conservatives aimed at keeping the power, which the new revolution in Russia endangered also. An aggravating of this was another [[general strike]] in Finland on 14-19 November, initiated by Social Democrats. The motive for the strike was to pressure the Conservative senate for political concessions. In addition, as the situation of V.I. Lenin and the Bolsheviks was under threat in St. Petersburg, they pressed the Finnish socialists to support the Russians and seize power. The majority of Finnish socialists were, however, moderate and for parlamentaristic means, Lenin called them "reluctant revolutionists". Still, on [[November 16]] at 5 a.m. as the general strike had appeared to be successful, the ''Workers' Revolutionary Central Council'', established for the strike, voted to seize power by a narrow majority. In the end, the supreme revolutionary organ, the [[executive committee]], could not recruit qualified members, comissaars and the "shortest [[revolution]]" had to be called off  on [[November 16]] at 7 p.m.. All this split the Finnish Social Democrats in two: a majority supporting parlamentarism and a minority demanding revolution. However, it would be decisive for the future that there were powerful leaders who swung between the main lines. The moderate socialists got support from the Finnish Parliament as it accepted the laws of eight-hour working time and universal suffrage for local elections on [[November 16]] 1917.  

During the strike the Worker's Security Guards began to affect the political development in the main cities of southern Finland, e.g. with several political executions. In addition, the first armed conflicts between the White Guards and the "Red" ones occurred; 10 to 15 casualties were reported. The Finnish Civil War would have probably broken out already in November 1917 if there had been enough weapons in the country to arm both the Guards. On the other hand, the race for weapons, which was initiated in November, was an important factor in the final escalation to the War <ref>Upton 1980, Alapuro 1988</ref>.

===Finnish Sovereignty===

During the October Revolution, the roles of Finland's two major political forces, socialists and non-socialists, were reversed. Now it was Conservatives and non-socialists, who were most eager for [[independence]] as the sovereignty would be beneficial for them in leading the domestic politics, controlling the Left and avoiding the effects of  Soviet-Russia. Thus the Senate, led by [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], proposed a [[Finland's declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]], which the Parliament adopted on [[December 6]]th, [[1917]] <ref>Keränen 1992, Haapala 1995</ref>. 

[[Image:Venäjä tunnustaa Suomen itsenäisyyden.gif|thumb|Lenin's bolshevik goverment's declaration of Finnish independency|left]]
The political conditions and divisions within the Finns in late 1917 made it seem "logical", for the Social Democrats to have tried to prevent independence in order to avoid Conservative dominance. The Socialists did vote against the Svinhufvud proposal in the Parliament on December sixth, but they presented their own declaration of independency, which contained no true differences. Thus both the major political groups agreed on the need for Finland's sovereignty, but they strongly disagreed on the leadership of the Finnish state <ref>Upton 1980, Alapuro 1988, Keränen 1992, Manninen 1993</ref>. 

However, sovereignty of a minor nation like Finland was not at all clear by its own decision and declaration. Political acceptance of the leading powers of Europe was required and the key to this was still in the city of St. Petersburg. It took three weeks before the Conservative cabinet finally faced the fact that they had to negotiate for Russian recognition with V.I. Lenin. And in this process the Finnish socialists supported P.E. Svinhufvud by asking Lenin to let the Finnish people go. During December 1917 the Bolsheviks were under pressure in discussions for peace with Germany at [[Brest-Litovsk]]. Furthermore, the new Soviet-Russia was in deep domestic crisis e.g. with an almost completely demoralized army and the outcome of the November Revolution still quite uncertain. V.I. Lenin, seeing clearly that in order to keep the main parts of Russia the Bolsheviks should give up Finland. Thus the Finns had finally no problems, on the last hour of [[December 31]] 1917, to get Lenin's signature on the agreement which opened the gates for freedom <ref>Upton 1980, Keränen 1992</ref>.

== The Warfare ==
[[Image:Suojeluskunta.jpg|thumb|220px|White Guard in Nummi. [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] were mobilized on 28.01., at 3 a.m. and the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] on 27.01.1918, at 11 p.m..]]

===Escalation===

Looking back now with hindsight, everything that happened during 1917 has been labeled a precursor to the Civil War. The escalation to the conflict is seen to have started with the February Revolution.  However, there were also many separate attempts by the opposing political factions to create a new order in 1917, but all came to naught. The general strike in November had finally cut off all the possibilities for a compromise between the Left and Right and a witch circle of fear, suspicion and mistrust grew deeper. The right-wing Conservatives came to realize that the groups of radical workers would threaten the status of the former estates and were willing to prevent such an event from occurring by any means, including armed resistance. Similarly, the left-wing socialists felt they could easily overcome the "ruins of the ancient regime" with weapons. As many times before in the course of history, during late 1917, the moderate, peaceful men and women moved aside as the mighty, aggressive men with rifles stepped forward to take control <ref>Upton 1980, Ylikangas 1993a, Haapala 1995</ref>.

The final rapid escalation to war began in early January, 1918. The most radical Worker's Security Guards from [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]] and [[Turku]] changed their names to Red Guards and challenged the moderate majority of the Social Democratic party to an internal power struggle. In the end, the radical minority won as the leaders, who had wavered between parliamentarism and revolution decided to plumb for the latter. At the same time, the Conservative [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] and the Parliament decided to create a "strong police authority" on [[January 12]] [[1918]].  It soon became obvious this was a move towards legalizing the White Guards, which further provoked the Red Guards.  [[Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim]], a former Russian army officer, was appointed supreme commander of the White Guards on [[January 15]] and his task was to build up the Finnish White Army.  His opponent, also a former Russian army officer, [[Ali Aaltonen]], had been appointed to lead the Worker's Security Guards of Finland in December, 1917. Later, in January, his army was renamed the Finnish Red Guard. Mannerheim placed his headquarters in [[Vaasa]], Aaltonen in [[Helsinki]] <ref>Upton 1980, Lappalainen 1981, Keränen 1992</ref>.

The first serious battles were fought during January 17-20 in [[Karelia]], primarily in the town of [[Viipuri]] in the southeastern corner of Finland. The struggle focused on both the control of Viipuri and the race for weapons.  The Conservative Senate officially named the White Guards the White Army of Finland on [[January 25]]. The Red Guards did not recognize the move and were waiting for a large shipment of weapons promised by Lenin.  The trains carrying these weapons were attacked by the Whites on [[January 27]]. 

The Red Order of Revolution was issued on [[January 26]] and the moment for the start of "official" hostilities was the late evening of [[January 27]]th. The corresponding White Order was given on [[January 25]] and the warfare began during the first hours of [[January 28]]th, 1918. Thus setting an "official" date for the beginning of the Finnish Civil War is a controversial point. A symbolic date might be [[January 26]], 1918, when a group of Reds from the Helsinki Guard climbed the tower of Helsinki Worker's Hall and lit up a red lantern to mark the start of the second major rebellion in the history of Finland <ref>Upton 1980, Lappalainen 1981</ref>.

===Brothers in Arms===

Finland was divided into Red Finland and White Finland. The Red Finland was led by the [[People's Delegation of Finland]] ([[Kullervo Manner]]) in Helsinki. The political system planned by the Reds was "ultra-democratic" socialism and did not resemble Lenin's "dictatorship of proletariat". [[Bolshevist Russia]] declared its intention to support the coming [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. If the Reds had won the Civil War, one major question would have been whether the socialistic Finland could keep its sovereignty alongside the mighty [[Soviet Union]] established in [[1922]]. Lenin and his comrades wanted to rejoin the Finns to Russia, but the majority of the Finnish socialists aimed at staying independent. However, during the war the Red Guards dominated the politics of the Red Finland with their weapons and at least the most radical Guards and the Finnish Bolsheviks, low in number, obviously supported a close Finno-Russian combination <ref>Upton 1981, Keränen 1992, Manninen 1993</ref>.

The members of the [[Senate of Finland]] were relocated to the city of [[Vaasa]] forming the [[Vaasa Senate]]. The town, acting as the capital of the White Finland from [[29 January]] to [[3 May]] is located on the Finnish west coast. The Vaasa Cabinet looked to Germany for a strong military and political aid. The white general Mannerheim agreed on the need for German weapons, but opposed an intervention of German troops in Finland. Furthermore, Conservatives aimed at a monarchistic political system with minor parliamentarism. Part of the Conservatives had been consistedly against democracy, whereas part of them saw that the crisis of the year 1917 proved "the power of the common people" an impossible practice. The moderate non-socialists opposed the plans to restrict parliamentarism. In addition, in the beginning of the Civil War they resisted the military help by the Germans, but the prolonged warfare changed their opinion positive toward the German army <ref>Upton 1981, Vares 1998, Lackman 2000</ref>.

The Finnish Civil War was fought along the railways as these were the most important means of transportation for troops and supplies. The front settled in the beginning of the conflict along a line through southern Finland (from west to east): Pori-Ikaalinen-Vilppula-Länkipohja-Padasjoki-Heinola-Savitaipale-Lappeenranta-Antrea-Rautu. The Reds controlled the area south and the Whites the area north of the line. The number of troops varied on both sides from 50,000 to 90,000 soldiers. The Red Guards were formed mostly from volunteers. There were 11,000-15,000 volunteers on the White side, the rest of the men being conscripted soldiers. The main motives for the volunteers to join the guard were economical factors (salary, food), idealism and communal or more personal pressuring. A special feature of the Red side was female Red Guards (comprising of 2,000 women, mostly young girls) built up in the industrial centres of southern Finland. In addition, both armies used child soldiers, mainly aged between 15-17 years. In the Red Guards, the majority of the members were urban and agrarian workers, whereas peasants and  well-educated people were the backbone of the White Guards <ref>Lappalainen 1981, Manninen 1992-1993, Ylikangas 1993a, Aunesluoma & Häikiö 1995</ref>.

===Red Guards and Russian Army===
[[Image:Red officers.jpg|thumb|Red officers on their horses.]]
The Reds seized power of the Finnish capital, [[Helsinki]], in the early hours of [[January 28]]. In addition, they had the advantage in the battles in the beginning of the war until [[March 14]], 1918.  The Reds were not able to capitalize on their  momentum as the Worker's Army was ill-prepared for war.  Firstly, there was a marked lack of skilled leaders both at the higher staff level and in the field. Secondly, the men of the Guards were in effect armed civilians and not true army soldiers; their military training was poor and discipline among the troops sorely lacking. Thus, results along any sector of the main front line during the Red Guard's "attack phase" were at best only minor battle successes, the most significant achieved occurring at the end of the war during the retreat from southern Finland to Russia at the battles of [[Hauho]] and [[Tuulos]], Syrjäntaka on April 28-29, 1918.  These negligible results for the Reds led to changes in the leadership; Ali Aaltonen was soon replaced by [[Eero Haapalainen]] and he was followed by a triumvirate [[Eino Rahja]], [[Adolf Taimi]] and [[Evert Eloranta]].  The last commander of the Red Guards was [[Kullervo Manner]] <ref>Upton 1981, Lappalainen 1981</ref>.

When the Civil War started there were some sixty to eighty thousand Russian soldiers of the former Tsar's army left in Finland. After Finland's independence Lenin could only hope that the crisis between the Finns would cause a revolt in the country and ease the threatened status of the Bolsheviks in St. Petersburg. As the War of the Year 1918 began Lenin tried to send the army into battle for the Red Finland. However, only 7,000 to 10,000 soldiers were active in the war between the Reds and the Whites. The rest "suffered" from homesickness, war weariness and demoralization. In the end, only 1,000 - 4,000 fighters could be persuaded to participate on the battlefield, as formations of 100 to 1,000 men occasionally in different parts of the front line. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that they could not have any true importance in the outcome of the war. The exception to this was the southeastern front, close to St. Petersburg, but the main motive to fight there was the defence of the Russian capital. In addition, there were a few skilled Russian army officers e.g. [[M. Svetshnikov]] leading the battles in western Finland throughout February 1918. Still, Finno-Russian formations were unable to advance anywhere northwards and secure victory in the war, although during February the defensive capability of the Whites was low. The number of Russian soldiers active in the Civil War declined markedly after the [[Brest-Litovsk]] peace negotiations were halted and Germany attacked Soviet-Russia on [[February 18]] 1918, resulting as a total collapse of what was left of the former mighty Russian army.  This led to the final peace and the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on [[March 3]] and subsequently the Bolsheviks could only support the Finnish Reds by sending weapons and supplies <ref>Upton 1981, Manninen 1992-1993, Aunesluoma & Häikiö 1995, Lackman 2000</ref>.

===White Guards and German Army===

[[Image:Tampere war victims 1918.jpg|thumb|270px|Unburied bodies – outcome of the [[Battle of Tampere]].]]

The Finnish White Army seized the initiative from the Reds with a large counterattack by [[March 15]] 1918, and subsequently never lost it. The military condition of the common soldiers (i.e. armed civilians) among the White Guards did not differ much from their Red counterparts, with only brief and inadequate training for most troops. The Whites had however two major advantages compared to the Reds; professional leadership by General Mannerheim and his staff (including Swedish officers, and Finnish ones from the former Tsar's army) and the approx. 1,300 volunteers called [[Finnish Jäger troops|"Jäger" troops ''(Jääkärit)'']]  trained in Germany and in the East Front during 1915-1917. Mannerheim's grand plan was to invade Finland's most important industrial town [[Tampere]] in southwest first. The [[battle of Tampere]], lasting until [[April 6]], became a decisive action in the course of the whole war, and it was the largest military engagement in Scandinavian history thus far. The attack led to the most blood-consuming turmoil of the entire Civil War as the ability of the Reds to defend had risen and the Whites were using brand new, somewhat better trained detachments. The Whites suffered losses of 500-1,000 men dead, the Reds 1,000-2,000 fighters killed and 11,000 imprisoned. The battle of Tampere saw "brother rise against brother",  Finn against Finn, as the main part of the Russian army had retreated to Russia during March and German troops were still on their way to Finland's coast. After the defeat in Tampere the Red army retreated eastwards and the military focus of the White army moved towards [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. Karelia's main city was taken on [[April 29]]. The last strongholds of the Finnish Red Army fell in southwestern Finland by [[May 5]] <ref>Lappalainen 1981, Upton 1981, Ylikangas 1993a, Aunesluoma & Häikiö 1995, Lackman 2000</ref>.

The German Empire joined the Finnish Civil War supporting the White Army's offensive. The Finnish Right, especially the [[Activists]] had since autumn 1917 been asking the Germans to invade and free the country from Russian hegemony, but these requests were denied due to the plans for an armistice and peace negotiations with the Russians. This situation was radically altered however as the Bolsheviks - mainly at [[Lev Trotsky]]'s behest - broke off the peace negotiations on [[February 10]] (which had commenced on [[December 22]] ) and the German Warlords decided to put Russia in order. In addition, the activity of British naval troops in the northeastern Russia, specifically the [[Kola Peninsula]], was of increasing concern in Berlin. The Germans initiated a final attack on [[February 18]] having demanded  "requests for help"  from the smaller countries west of Russia beforehand in order to mask the blow. Finland asked for help on [[February 14]].  The German army, in the form of the [[Baltic Sea Division]] led by [[Rudiger von der Goltz]] and 10,000 strong, made a thrust west of Helsinki at [[Hanko]] on [[April 3]] 1918 while [[Brigade Brandenstein]] with 3,000 men overran the town of [[Loviisa]] on the southeastern coast on [[April 7]]. The main formations advanced rapidly eastwards from Hanko taking Helsinki on [[April 13]] and at the same time two German battleships with smaller vessels entered the city harbour cannoning the Red positions, including the present-day Presidential Palace. The Brandenstein Brigade attacked the town of [[Lahti]] on [[April 19]], cutting the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. The main detachment advanced from Helsinki northwards taking the towns of [[Hyvinkää]] and [[Riihimäki]] on April 21-22 and finally [[Hämeenlinna]] on [[April 26]] 1918. The contrast between the high performance of the German top detachments and the inability of the more or less demoralized Russian troops in the Civil War is quite striking <ref>Upton 1981, Arimo 1991, Manninen 199-21993, Lackman 2000</ref>.

The People's Delegation of Finland fled from [[Helsinki]] on [[April 8]] and from [[Viipuri]] to St. Petersburg on [[April 25]]. The Finnish Civil War ended on May 14-15, when a small number of Russian troops retreated from the coastal artillery base on the [[Karelian Isthmus]]. White Finland celebrated the Grand Victory in [[Helsinki]] on [[May 16]] 1918 <ref>Keränen 1992</ref>.

===Red and White Terror===
[[Image:FiringsquadLankipohja.jpg|thumb|White firing squad executing Red soldiers in Länkipohja|250px]]

According to the earlier views of the war-time terror in 1918, both sides of the conflict agreed to [[rules of engagement]] and major turning points against this were the [[Suinula massacre]] conducted by the Reds and the [[Varkaus massacre]] carried out by the Whites. After these incidents the both sides started to take revenge with similar executions, escalating in mostly local violence leading to massacres and [[terrorism]] <ref>Paavolainen 1966 and 1967, Keränen 1992, Uola 1998</ref>. However, current and more objective results of the studies concerning political violence during the Civil War indicate that the terror was a part of the general warfare. At least a third of the Red terror and perhaps most of the White terror was centrally organized by the higher staffs <ref>Tikka 2004</ref>. The Reds executed people they saw as main leaders and supporters ("class enemies") of the White power, including e.g. industrialists, politicians and major landowners. On the White side the main goal was to gain "a final control" over the recently occupied areas through executions of Red guard and party leaders, and those who participated in the Red terror and the war.  In this respect too, the fight between the Finns resembled many other Civil Wars in history. In total 1 400-1,650 Whites were shot in the Red terror, the figure for Red casualties due to White terror being around 7,000-9,000 <ref>Paavolainen 1966 and 1967, Manninen 1992-1993, Eerola & Eerola 1998</ref>.

===Outcome of Wrath===

The Civil War was in many ways a major catastrophe for the Finnish nation and society <ref>Haapala 1995</ref>. As a result of the turmoil almost 37,000 people perished, deepening divisions within the nation that caused bitterness, fear, hatred and a desire for revenge. A notable feature of the war was that only about 10,000 casulties were lost on the battlefields. Most of the death was caused by the red and white terror and high mortality rate in the prison camps. In addition, about 20,000 children were orphaned as a result of the hostilities. A large number of Finnish Reds fled to Russia at the end of the Civil War and in the years shortly thereafter <ref>Upton 1981, Keränen 1992, Peltonen 2003, Tikka 2004</ref>. 

Finnish society was split in many ways. Conservatives and moderate non-socialists disagreed strongly on the [[form of government]], the former demanding monarchy and restricted parliamentarism, the latter urging for social reforms and full scale democracy. In foreign policy both groups leant on Germany and its mighty army; in the end of May the Finnish Senate asked the Germans to remain in country. The new senate having a monarchist majority was formed by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J.K. Paasikivi]] . The Finnish Parliament was incomplete as most of the Social Democratic representatives were prevented from joining it. A major outcome of the 1918 conflict was the breakdown of the Finnish worker movement in three parts: moderate Social Democrats, left-wing socialists in Finland and communists acting in Soviet-Russia with the support of the Bolsheviks <ref>Upton 1981, Keränen 1992, Manninen 1992-1993, Vares 1998</ref>. 

Finland was bound politically, economically and militarily to the German Empire via the agreements signed on [[March 7]] 1918. The Germans has demanded them as a precondition of military intervention but this consequently weakened Finnish sovereignty markedly. Furthermore they proposed a military pact in summer 1918. The White general Mannerheim resigned his post on [[May 25]] due both to disagreements with the Senate about the German hegemony over the country and his planned attack on St. Petersburg in order to repulse the Bolsheviks (which the Germans opposed, wanting to keep the peace with Lenin). Finally, the monarchist Senate chose a German prince [[Friedrich Karl]] to be the King of Finland on [[October 9]], altered the country to a monarchist state <ref>Rautkallio 1977, Upton 1981, Keränen 1992, Manninen 1992-1993, Vares 1998</ref>.

The economical condition in the country had weakened too due to the 1918 conflict, and pre-conflicts levels were reached only in 1925. The most severe problem was the food supply, which was already weak in 1917 although there was no large scale starvation with the exception of some northern and northeastern parts of Finland. The War of the Year 1918, which according to the Red and White Warlords was going to solve everything, led instead to severe starvation in southern Finland too <ref>Haapala 1995</ref>. 

====Prison camps====

White and German troops had captured about 80,000 Red prisoners by the end of the war on [[May 5]] 1918.  Finally there was 74,000 prisoners left once the tide of white terror had ebbed and a few thousand Reds had been set free. The largest prison camps were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[Hämeenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Viipuri]], [[Tammisaari]], [[Riihimäki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Finnish Senate made the decision to detain Reds in prison camps in order to examine the guilt of the rebels individually. Combined with the severe food deficit, this policy led to high mortality rates in the camps. This catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference shown by the victors. The condition of prisoners weakened rapidly during May as food supplies were disrupted during the Red Army's retreat in April. They were abandoned - by White Finland as well as their own leaders who had fled to Russia. As a consequence June saw 2,900 starve to death or die as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition, with the figures for July rising to 4,900. The corresponding values for August were 2,150 and for September 1,000 prisoners. They were buried in mass graves in vicinity of the camps. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Tammisaari]] camp 34%, in the others the level varied between 5 and 20%. In total 11,000- 13,000 Finns perished <ref>Paavolainen 1971, Manninen 1992-1993, Eerola & Eerola 1998</ref>.

===The Compromise===

As the fate of the Finns was decided in St. Petersburg on [[March 15]] 1917, so the lot of the nation was resolved again in Berlin on [[November 11]] 1918 as Germany accepted defeat in the First World War. The grand plans of the German Warlords had finally come to nothing and revolution had spread among the common people throughout the country due to lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles on the Western Front. German troops left [[Helsinki]] on [[December 16]] and Prince [[Friedrich Karl]] gave up his crown on [[December 20]] 1918. Following this Finland became an independent country reverting from monarchy to a democratic republic. The first local elections based on universal suffrage in the history of Finland were held during 17-28 December 1918, and the first parliamentary election after the Civil War on [[March 3]] 1919 <ref>Keränen 1992, Manninen 1992-1993</ref>.

After the Civil War, in 1919 a moderate Social Democrat [[Väinö Voionmaa]] wrote: "Those, who still trust on the future of this nation, must have an exceptionally strong faith. Alongside the war this young independent country has lost almost everything... ".  At the same time, a moderate non-socialist, the coming first president of Finland [[Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg|K.J. Ståhlberg]] (elected on [[July 25]] 1919), struggling for parliamentarism wrote: "It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from" <ref>Haapala 1995</ref>. 

Together with the other moderate non-socialists and socialists they constructed a Finnish compromise leading to a stable and broad parliamentary democracy. It was based on both the defeat of the Red Finland in the Civil War and on the fact that the most important political goals of White Finland did not come true as Germany lost the World War. After the "foreign bayonets" left Finland, the Finns were bound to find each other. As for the Civil War, the conciliation led to a slow, but steady national unification. The compromise has turned out to be surprisingly strong and permanent. During the years 1919-1991 it was tested by both right-wing and left-wing radicalism, the crisis of the [[Second World War]] and the pressure from the [[Soviet Union]] in the Cold War era <ref>Upton 1981, Ylikangas 1986, Haapala 1995</ref>.
