'''Charleston Lake''' is located in South Eastern Ontario, just north east of [[Gananoque]]. The lake is carved out of the Frontenac Arch, an extention of the [[Canadian Shield]]. The lake is the principle watershed for the [[Gananoque River]]. [[Charleston Lake Provincial Park]] is located on the shores of the lake, and offers a range of camping services.
