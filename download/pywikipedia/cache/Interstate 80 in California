[[Interstate 80]], a major east-west route of the [[Interstate Highway System]], has its western terminus in [[San Francisco, California]], [[United States]]. From San Francisco it heads east across the [[Bay Bridge (San Francisco)|Bay Bridge]] to [[Oakland (CA)|Oakland]], where it turns north and crosses the [[Carquinez Bridge]] before turning back northeast and east through [[Sacramento (CA)|Sacramento]]. I-80 crosses into [[Nevada]] west of [[Reno, Nevada]].

==Major cities==

==West end in San Francisco==
[[Image:Interstate80westernend.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The start of Interstate 80 (actually State Route 80) in San Francisco]]
Signage takes I-80 to a west end at [[U.S. Route 101]] in San Francisco. However, the [[James Lick Skyway]] is not part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]; the Interstate actually begins at the west end of the Bay Bridge, at the ramps formerly connecting to the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] (originally planned as a connection to [[Interstate 480 (California)|Interstate 480]]). As such the first 1.20 miles of the signed Interstate are not officially an Interstate Highway according to the federal government, however the state of California does consider the first 1.2 miles part of Interstate 80.

When I-80 was first approved, it was to head north on the [[Central Freeway]] (US 101) and west on the never-built [[Panhandle Freeway]], ending at planned I-280 ([[State Route 1 (California)|State Route 1]]) in [[Golden Gate Park]]. A January [[1968]] amendment moved I-280 to its present alignment, removed [[Interstate 480 (California)|Interstate 480]], and truncated I-80 to the Embarcadero Freeway (then I-280, formerly I-480).<ref name="cah Interstates"/> These changes were made on the state level later that year, but Route 80 was only truncated to US 101. (The Central Freeway remained part of US 101, and the Panhandle Freeway became ''State Route 241''. The Panhandle Freeway was later cancelled in the wake of the [[freeway and expressway revolts|Freeway Revolts]], and the State Route 241 designation has since been reassigned to [[State Route 241 (California)|an unrelated stretch of highway]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) The [[James Lick Skyway]], which had already been signed as part of I-80, has remained a de facto section of Interstate 80 to the present day and remains listed as part of Route 80 in California.
