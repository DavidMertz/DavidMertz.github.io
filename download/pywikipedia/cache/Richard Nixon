'''Richard Milhous Nixon ''' ([[January 9]], [[1913]] &ndash; [[April 22]], [[1994]]) was the 37th [[President of the United States]], serving from 1969 to 1974. He was also the 36th [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1953&ndash;1961) serving under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Nixon redefined the office of Vice President, making it for the first time a high visibility platform and base for a presidential candidacy. He is the only person to have been elected twice to the Vice Presidency and twice to the Presidency, and the only president to have [[resignation|resigned]] that office. His resignation came in the face of imminent [[impeachment]] related to the [[Watergate first break-in]] and subsequent [[Watergate scandal]].  

Nixon is noted for his diplomatic [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]], especially [[DÃ©tente|relaxed]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]], and ending the [[Vietnam War]]. He is also noted for his middle-of-the-road domestic policy that combined conservative rhetoric and, in many cases, liberal action, as in his environmental policy. 

As president, Nixon imposed [[price controls|wage and price controls]], indexed [[Social Security]] for inflation, and created [[Supplemental Security Income|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]]. The number of pages added to the [[Federal Register]] each year doubled under Nixon. He advocated [[gun control]] and eradicated the last remnants of the [[gold standard]]. Nixon created the [[Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] and implemented the [[Philadelphia Plan]], the first significant federal [[affirmative action]] program.  As a party leader, Nixon helped build the GOP, but he ran his 1972 campaign separately from the party, which perhaps helped the GOP escape some of the damage from Watergate. See [[History of United States Republican Party]].

==Birth and early years== 
Richard Nixon was born in [[Yorba Linda, California]] to [[Francis Nixon]] and Hannah Milhouse Nixon in a house his father built from a kit purchased from [[Sears, Roebuck]]. He was raised by his mother as an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]. His upbringing is said to have been marked by such conservative evangelical Quaker observances as refraining from drinking, dancing and swearing. His father (known as Frank) was a former member of the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] who had sincerely converted to Quakerism but never fully absorbed its spirit, retaining instead a volatile temper. Richard Nixon's great-grandfather, George Nixon III, had been killed at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] during the [[American Civil War]] while serving in the 73rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. 

[[Image:Lt_Cmdr_Richard_Nixon_1945.jpg|left|The young Lt Commander Richard Nixon of the US Navy 1945]]

Nixon attended [[Fullerton High School (California)|Fullerton High School]] from 1926-28 and Whittier High School from 1928-30. He graduated first in his class; showing a penchant for [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Latin]]. He won a full [[tuition]] [[scholarship]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]; but since it did not cover living expenses, Nixon's family was unable to afford to send him away to college. Nixon attended [[Whittier College]], a local Quaker school where he co-founded [[the Orthogonian Society]], a [[fraternity]] that competed with the already established [[The Franklin Society|Franklin Society]]. Nixon was elected student body president. A lifelong [[American football|football]] buff, Nixon practiced with the team assiduously but spent most of his time on the bench. In 1934, he graduated second in his class from Whittier and went on to [[Duke University]] [[Duke University School of Law|School of Law]], where he received a full scholarship.

Nixon returned to California, passed the [[bar (law)|bar]] exam, and began working in the small-town law office of a family friend in nearby [[La Mirada]]. The work was mostly routine, and Nixon generally found it to be dull, although he was entirely competent. He later wrote that family law cases caused him particular discomfort, since his reticent Quaker upbringing was severely at odds with the idea of discussing intimate marital details with strangers. 

It was during this period that he met his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]], a [[high school]] teacher; they were married on [[June 21]], [[1940]]. They had two daughters [[Tricia Nixon|Tricia]] and [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]].

During [[World War II]], Nixon served as an officer in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. He received his training at [[Quonset Point, Rhode Island]], and [[Ottumwa, Iowa]], before serving in the supply corps in the South [[Pacific]].  There he was known as "Nick" and for his prowess in [[poker]], banking a large sum that helped finance his first campaign for [[United States Congress|Congress]].

==Vice Presidency==
[[Image:Eisenhower 68-40-67.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nixon and Eisenhower at a [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 Campaign]] stop]]

In [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]] he was elected [[Vice President]] on [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s ticket, although he was only 39 years old.

One notable event of the campaign was Nixon's innovative use of [[television]]. Nixon was accused by nameless sources of misappropriating money out of a business fund for personal use. He went on TV and defended himself in an emotional speech, where he provided an independent third-party review of the fund's accounting along with a personal summary of his finances, which he cited as exonerating him from wrongdoing, and he charged that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Presidential candidate, [[Adlai Stevenson]], also had a [[slush fund]] (see Memoirs of Richard Nixon, page 99). This speech would, however, become better known for its rhetoric, such as when he stated that his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]] did not wear mink, but rather "a respectable Republican cloth coat," and that although he had been given a [[cocker spaniel]] named "Checkers" in addition to his other campaign contributions, he was not going to give it back because his daughters loved it. As a result, this speech became known as the "[[Checkers speech]]" and it resulted in a flood of support, prompting Eisenhower to keep Nixon on the ticket.

Nixon reinvented the office of Vice President. Although he had no formal power, he had the attention of the media and the Republican party. He demonstrated for the first time that the office could be a springboard to the White House; most Vice Presidents since have followed his lead and sought the presidency (exceptions being [[Nelson Rockefeller]], and [[Spiro Agnew]].) Nixon was the first Vice President to actually step in to temporarily run the government. He did that three times when Eisenhower was ill: on the occasions of Eisenhower's [[heart attack]] on [[September 24]], [[1955]]; his [[ileitis]] in June [[1956]]; and his [[stroke]] on [[November 25]], [[1957]]. His quick thinking was on display on [[July 24]], [[1959]], at the opening of the American National Exhibition in [[Moscow]] where he and [[Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had an impromptu "[[kitchen debate]]" about the merits of [[capitalism]] versus [[communism]].

==1960 election and post-Vice Presidency ==
[[Image:Jfknixon.jpg|thumb|Vice President Nixon, right, and Senator John Kennedy during their TV debate prior to the 1960 presidential election]]

In [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]], he ran for President on his own but lost to [[John F. Kennedy]]. 
The race was very close all year long, and any number of small episodes could have tilted the results one way or the other, including the televised debates. <ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kennedy-nixon/kennedy-nixon.htm Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debates, 1960] - Erika Tyner Allen, [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]], accessed [[April 4]], [[2006]]</ref> Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy said it was time for new blood and suggested the Eisenhower-Nixon administration had been soft on defense.  

In [[1962]], Nixon lost a race for [[Governor of California]]. In his concession [[speech]], Nixon accused the media of favoring his opponent [[Pat Brown]], and stated that it was his "last press conference" and that "You don't have Nixon to kick around any more."

==1968 Election==
Nixon moved to [[New York City]] where he became a well-paid senior partner in a leading law firm, Nixon Mudge Rose Guthrie & Alexander. During the [[U.S. House election, 1966|1966 Congressional elections]], he stumped the country in support of Republican candidates, rebuilding his base in the party. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|election of 1968]], he completed a remarkable political comeback by taking the nomination. Nixon appealed to what he called the "[[silent majority]]" of socially conservative Americans who disliked the "[[hippie]]" [[counterculture]] and [[anti-war]] demonstrators. Nixon promised "peace with honor," and without claiming to be able to win the war, Nixon claimed that "new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the [[Pacific]]". He did not explain in detail his plans to end the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]], leading [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] and the media to allege that he must have some "[[Election promise#Richard Nixon's Election promises|secret plan]]." Nixon did not use the phrase, and stated in his memoirs that he had no such plan. He defeated Humphrey and [[George Wallace]] to become the 37th President of the United States.

==Presidency 1968-1974==
===Policies===
Once in office, he proposed the [[Nixon Doctrine]] to establish a strategy of turning over the fighting of the war to the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]. In July 1969 he visited [[South Vietnam]], and met with President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] and with U.S. military commanders. American involvement in the war declined steadily until all American troops were gone in 1973. After the withdrawal of U.S. troops, fighting was left to the South Vietnamese army, which was well supplied with modern arms, but whose fighting capability was in question due to inadequate funding, low morale, and corruption. The lack of funding was primarily due to large funding cutbacks by the US Congress. 

Nixon ordered secret bombing campaigns in [[Cambodia]] in March, 1969 (code-named ''Menu'') to destroy what were believed to be the headquarters and large numbers of soldiers of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam]]. 

[[Image:Nixon_greets_POW_McCain.jpg|thumb|left|President Nixon greets released [[POW]] (and future Republican Senator) Navy officer [[John McCain III|John McCain]] (on crutches) after years of imprisonment in [[North Vietnam]], 1973.]]

In ordering the bombings, Nixon realized he would be extending an unpopular war as well as breaching [[Cambodia]]'s "official" (but false) neutrality.  During deliberations over Nixon's [[impeachment]], his unorthodox use of [[executive powers]] over the ordering of these bombings was considered as an article of impeachment, but the charge was dropped as not a violation of Constitutional powers.

On [[July 20]], [[1969]], Nixon addressed [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] during their historic [[moonwalk]], live via radio. Nixon also made the world's longest distance phone call to Neil Armstrong on the moon. On [[January 5]], [[1972]], Nixon approved the development of the [[Space Shuttle program]], a decision that profoundly influenced U.S. efforts to explore and develop space for several decades thereafter. 

[[Image:Nixon_meets_Mao_in_China_1972.gif|thumb|right|President Nixon greets [[Chinese Communist Party]] [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] (left) in China visit 1972]]
The 60's were a period of dÃ©tente between the Western and Eastern Blocs. That changed dramatically by the early 70s. In 1960, the [[People's Republic of China]] ended the alliance with its biggest ally, the [[Soviet Union]], in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]. As tensions between the two communist nations reached its peak in 1969 and 1970, Nixon decided to use their conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War. In what later would be known as the "China Card", Nixon deliberately improved relations with China in order to blackmail the Soviet Union. In 1971 a move was made to improve relationships when China invited an American table tennis team to China; hence the term "[[Ping Pong Diplomacy]]". The USâs response was to support Chinaâs entry into the U.N., something it had always vetoed. In October 1971, China entered the U.N. In 1972, Richard Nixon became the first US president to [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visit "Red" China]] though the USA kept a massive naval fleet off of [[Taiwan]]. Fearing the possibility of a Sino-American alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to Nixon immediately. The first [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] were finally concluded the same year.

Nixon was also very vocal in supporting General [[Yahya Khan]] of [[Pakistan]] despite escalating violence in [[East Pakistan]]. Subsequently declassified documents reveal the extent of support offered by Nixon to the dictator notwithstanding the widespread human rights violations. <ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/ The Tilt: The U.S. and the South Asian Crisis of 1971] - Sajit Gandhi, [[National Security Archive]] Electronic Briefing Book No. 79, [[December 16]], [[2002]] </ref> He was also vocal in abusing [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]] as an "old [[witch]]" in private conversations with Henry Kissinger, who is also recorded as making derogatory comments against Indians.Which was beleived to know that some voters of President Nixon regreted voting for him.Due to the fact that he had many votes from Indians who live in the U.S. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4633263.stm Nixon's dislike of 'witch' Indira] - [[BBC]], [[June 29]], [[2005]]</ref>

Nixon supported the wave of military [[coup d'Ã©tat|"golpes de Estado"]] in [[South America]]. Through [[Henry Kissinger]], he gave at least an implicit help to [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s coup, in 1973, and then helped set up [[operation Condor]] (as evidenced by CIA documents released in 2000, following Pinochet's arrest in 1998). A US-intelligence base in [[Panama Canal]] coordinated the acts of the various Latino secret services ([[DINA]], [[DirecciÃ³n de los Servicios de Inteligencia y PrevenciÃ³n|DISIP]], etc.)        

He established the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) on [[December 2]], [[1970]].

In [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]] Nixon was re-elected in one of the biggest landslide election victories in U.S. political history, defeating [[George McGovern]] and garnering over 60% of the popular vote. He carried 49 of the 50 states, losing only in [[Massachusetts]]. 

On [[January 2]], [[1974]], Nixon signed a bill that lowered the maximum U.S. [[speed limit]] to 55 [[mile per hour|MPH]] (90 [[kilometers per hour|km/h]]) in order to conserve [[gasoline]] during the [[1973 energy crisis]]. This law remained in effect until the late 1980s.

On [[April 3]], [[1974]], Nixon announced he would pay $432,787.13 in back taxes plus interest after a Congressional committee reported that he had inadvertently underpaid his 1969 and 1972 taxes.

In light of the near certainty of both his impeachment by the House of Representatives and his conviction by the Senate, Nixon resigned on [[August 9]], [[1974]].

=== Watergate ===
{{main|Watergate scandal}}

[[Image:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|right|Nixon departing the White House on [[August 9]], [[1974]]]]
In October 1972, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported the FBI had determined Nixon aides had spied on and sabotaged numerous Democratic presidential candidates as a part of the operations that led to the infamous [[Watergate scandal]]. During the campaign five burglars were arrested on   [[June 17]], [[1972]] in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] headquarters at the [[Watergate]] office complex. They were subsequently linked to the [[White House]]. This became one of a series of major scandals involving the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]] (known as CRP but referred to by outsiders as CREEP), including the White House [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]] and assorted "[[dirty tricks]]." The ensuing Watergate scandal exposed the Nixon administration's rampant corruption, illegality, and deceit.  Nixon himself downplayed the scandal as mere politics, but when his aides resigned in disgrace, Nixon's role in ordering an illegal cover-up came to light in the press, courts, and congressional investigations.  Nixon evaded taxes, accepted illicit [[campaign contribution]]s, ordered secret bombings, and harassed opponents with [[executive agencies]], [[wiretap]]s, and break-ins.  Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned in October 1973 for accepting [[bribes]], but Nixon hung on to power, claiming, "I am not a crook."  His secret recordings of [[White House]] conversations were [[subpoena]]ed, and revealed details of his complicity in the cover-up. Nixon was named by the grand jury investigating Watergate as "an unindicted co-conspirator" in the [[Watergate Scandal]]. He lost support from some in his own party as well as much popular support after what became known as the [[Saturday Night Massacre]] of [[October 20]], [[1973]] in which he ordered [[Archibald Cox]], the [[special prosecutor]] in the Watergate case fired, as well as firing several of his own subordinates who objected to this move. The [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] opened formal and public [[impeachment]] hearings against Nixon on [[May 9]], [[1974]]. Despite his efforts, one of the secret recordings, known as the "smoking gun" tape, was released on [[August 5]], [[1974]] and revealed that Nixon authorized hush money to Watergate burglar [[E. Howard Hunt]], and also revealed that Nixon arranged for the blackmailing of the [[CIA]] into telling the [[FBI]] to stop investigating certain topics because of "the Bay of Pigs thing". Several of the Watergate burglars were involved in the [[Bay of Pigs]] operation. [[H. R. Haldeman|Haldeman]] would later claim that when Nixon used the phrase "the Bay of Pigs thing," he was actually referring to the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. In light of his loss of political support and the near certainty of both his impeachment by the House of Representatives and his conviction by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], he resigned on [[August 9]], [[1974]], after addressing the nation on [[television]] the previous evening.  {{Audio|Nixon_Resign.ogg|listen}} He never admitted wrongdoing, though he later conceded errors of judgment.  Had he not resigned, he would assuredly have been the second American president to be impeached, after [[Andrew Johnson]] a hundred years earlier. 

On September 8, 1974, a blanket pardon from President [[Gerald R. Ford]], who served as Nixon's second [[vice president]], effectively ended any possibility of indictment. The pardon was highly controversial and Nixon's critics claimed that the blanket pardon was [[quid pro quo]] for his resignation. No evidence of this "[[corrupt bargain]]" has ever been proven, and many modern historians dismiss any claims of overt collusion between the two men concerning the pardon.  The pardon hurt Ford politically, and it was one of the major reasons cited for Ford's defeat in the election of 1976.

==Later years and death==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Nixon94.jpg|thumb|Nixon in [[Russia]], [[1994]].]] -->

In his later years Nixon worked to rehabilitate his public image, and enjoyed considerably more success than could have been anticipated at the time of his resignation. He gained great respect as an elder statesman in the area of foreign affairs, being consulted by both Democratic and Republican successors to the Presidency.

Further tape releases, however, removed any doubt of Nixon's involvement both in the Watergate cover-up and also the illegal campaign finances and intrusive government surveillance that were at the heart of the scandal. 

Nixon wrote many books after his departure from politics, including his memoirs.

On [[April 18]], [[1994]], Nixon, 81, suffered a major [[stroke]] at his home in [[Park Ridge, New Jersey]], and died four days later on [[April 22]]. He was buried beside his wife [[Pat Nixon]] (who had died ten months earlier, on [[June 22]], [[1993]], of [[lung cancer]]) on the grounds of the [[Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace]] in [[Yorba Linda, California]]. 

President [[Bill Clinton]], former secretary of state [[Henry Kissinger]], Senate Majority Leader [[Bob Dole]] and California Republican Governor [[Pete Wilson]] spoke at the [[April 27]] funeral, the first for an American president since that of [[Lyndon Johnson]] on [[January 25]], [[1973]], a ceremony Nixon presided over when president; also in attendance were former presidents [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and their respective first ladies. Nixon was survived by his two daughters, along with his four grandchildren.

The Nixon Library contains only Nixon's pre- and post-presidential papers, as his presidential papers have been retained as government evidence. Nixon's attempts to protect his papers and gain tax advantages from them had been one of the important themes of the Watergate affair. Due to [[Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace#Nixon record controversies|disputes over the papers]], the library is privately funded and does not, like the other [[presidential library|presidential libraries]], receive support from the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].

===On race===
* âBut by God, they're exceptions. But Bob, generally speaking, you can't trust the bastards. They turn on us.â (On [[Jews]], to [[Bob Haldeman]]) <ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/1003783/ Nixon: I Am Not an Anti-Semite] - Timothy Noah, ''Slate'', [[October 7]], [[1999]]</ref>
* âJewish families are close, but there's this strange malignancy that seems to creep among them - radicalism.â
* âYou can never put, John, any person who is a Jew on a civil rights kind of case, or freedom of the press kind of case, and get even a ten percent chance. . . . Basically, who the hell are these people that stole the papers? It's too bad. I'm sorry. I was hoping one of them would be a gentile.â

===On Watergate===
[[Image:Pres38-42.jpg|thumb|Presidents [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] watched over Nixon's funeral in 1994. He was the first president to die since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 70's while Nixon was still president.]]
*"When you get in these people when you...get these people in, say: "Look, the problem is that this will open the whole, the whole Bay of Pigs thing, and the President just feels that" ah, without going into the details... don't, don't lie to them to the extent to say there is no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it, "the President believes that it is going to open the whole Bay of Pigs thing up again. And, ah because these people are plugging for, for keeps and that they should call the FBI in and say that we wish for the country, don't go any further into this case", period!" The 'smoking gun tape' on [[June 23]], [[1972]]. Nixon was telling Haldeman to tell the CIA to stop the FBI investigation, by telling the CIA that it would 'open the whole Bay of Pigs thing.' Haldeman did give Nixon's order to the CIA's Richard Helms, who exploded into a rage of fury when told, according to Haldeman. Haldeman would later write that Nixon used the expression 'the Bay of Pigs thing' when he was referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
*"I want to say this to the television audience. I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never profited from public service. I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. And I think, too, that I can say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their President's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got." [[November 17]], [[1973]] Televised press conference with 400 Associated Press Managing Editors at [[Walt Disney World]], [[Florida]], Nixon summarized his responses to journalists' questions regarding speculation and criticism of his [[personal finances]] and the Watergate scandal.
*"I don't give a shit what happens. I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|Fifth Amendment]], cover up or anything else, if it'll save it, save this plan. That's the whole point. We're going to protect our people if we can." (to Haldeman, tapes ordered released for the trial of [[H. R. Haldeman|Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman|Ehrlichman]] and [[John N. Mitchell|Mitchell]])
*"I recognize that this additional material I am now furnishing may further damage my case," (after the ordered release of the [[White House]] tapes [[August 5]] [[1974]])
*"Well, when the President does it, that means that it's not illegal." (explaining his interpretation of Executive Privilege to interviewer [[David Frost (broadcaster)|David Frost]] on television, May 19, 1977) <ref>[http://www.landmarkcases.org/nixon/nixonview.html Nixon's Views on Presidential Power: Excerpts from an Interview with David Frost] - Landmark [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Cases, ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', interview on [[May 19]], [[1977]]</ref>
*"I was under medication when I made the decision not to burn the tapes."
*"Well, I screwed it all up real good, didn't I?"
*"The greatness comes not when things go always good for you, but the greatness comes and you are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadness comes, because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain... Always remember, others may hate you. Those who hate you don't win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself." Farewell to White House staff [[August 8]] [[1974]].
*"I think that the ability of the American people to review all that there is to know about their president using a microscope is wonderful.  Still, I think some people get a little carried away when they take out their [[proctoscope]]s." (regarding the intense scrutiny which he was forced to endure.)

===On peace===
*"Any nation that decides the only way to achieve peace is through peaceful means is a nation that will soon be a piece of another nation." (from his book ''No More Vietnams'')
*"The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker." (From his 1969 inaugural; later used as Nixon's [[epitaph]])

*"I don't know a lot about politics, but I do know a lot about [[baseball]]."

*"Any man who has had power, has been a lonely man."

==Nixon's image and media portrayals==
Nixon's career was frequently dogged by Nixon's personality, and the public perception of it. Editorial cartoonists such as [[Herblock]] and comedians had fun exaggerating Nixon's appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature version of him became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed as a sullen loner, with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow. He was also characterized as the very epitome of a "square" and the personification of unpleasant adult authority. Nixon tried to shed these perceptions by staging [[photo-op]]s with young people, and even cameo appearances on popular TV shows such as ''[[Laugh-In]]'' and ''[[Hee Haw]]'' (before he was president). He also frequently brandished the two-finger [[V sign]] (alternately viewed as the "Victory sign" or "peace sign") using both hands, an act which became one of his best-known trademarks. Once the transcripts of the White House tapes were released, people were shocked at the amount of swearing and vicious comments about opponents that Nixon issued.  This did not help the public perception, and fed the comedians even more.  Nixon's sense of being persecuted by his "enemies," his grandiose belief in his own moral and political excellence, and his commitment to utilize ruthless power at all costs led some experts to describe him as having a [[narcissistic]] and [[paranoid]] personality. <ref>[http://www.ralphmag.org/nixon.html Nixon: A Psychobiography] - Vamik D. Volkan,
Norman Itzkowitz, and Andrew W. Dod, book review by Michael A. Ingall, accessed [[April 4]], [[2006]]</ref>  During the Watergate Scandal, Nixon's approval rating had fallen to 25%. 
[[Image:elvis-nixon.jpg|thumb|200px|Nixon meets [[Elvis Presley]] in December 1970]]

*The book and movie ''[[All the President's Men]]'' tell Woodward and Bernstein's story of the Watergate affair. 
*Best-selling historian-author [[Stephen Ambrose]] wrote a three-volume biography (''Nixon: The Education of a Politician 1913-1962'', ''Nixon: The Triumph of a Politician, 1962-1972'', ''Nixon: Ruin and Recovery 1973-1990'') considered the definitive work among many Nixon biographies. The detailed accounts were mostly favorably regarded by both liberal and conservative reviewers.
*Conservative author [[Victor Lasky]] published a book in [[1977]] called ''It Didn't Start With Watergate''.  The book points out that past presidents may have used [[wiretaps]] and engaged in other activities that Nixon was accused of, but were never pursued by the press or the subject of impeachment hearings.
*[[Chuck Colson]] gives an insider account of the Watergate affair in ''[[Born Again]]''.
* [[H.R. Haldeman]] also provides an insider's perspective in the books ''The Ends of Power'' and ''The Haldeman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White House''
*The movie ''[[Nixon (movie)|Nixon]]'' directed by [[Oliver Stone]].
*''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'' is an [[opera]] dealing with Nixon's visit there.
*Richard Nixon was elected president of the world in [[Matt Groening]]'s cartoon series [[Futurama]], claiming that the Consitution stated that no''body'' may run more than twice, and he is now just a head. He also appears in the simpsons in flashbacks or on television.
the comedy Dick shows a comedianized version of the watergate scandel by saying that DeepTHroat was two teenage girls who happen to know of the movie because their older brother went to see it. They get iin the white house since they are presidential "dogwalkers" . this movie brings up many interesting points.

==Trivia==
