'''Fictionary''', also known as the '''Dictionary Game''', is a [[word game]] in which players guess the definition of an obscure word. 

A turn consists of one player picking a word from the [[dictionary]] and each other player composing a fake definition. A round is completed when each player has selected a word to be guessed.

Players earn points (1) by guessing the correct definition of a word, (2) by composing a fake definition that other players guess is the correct one, and (3)  as Picker, selecting a genuine word that no players vote for. 

The winner is the player who has earned the most points after a pre-determined number of rounds.  

== Supplies ==

* A large, preferably unabridged dictionary
* A [[pencil]], [[pen]] or other writing implement for each player
* Notecards or identical pieces of [[paper]] for each player

== Order of play == 
Individual [[house rules]] may vary when playing Fictionary, but play usually proceeds like this:

One player, the word Picker for the turn, chooses an obscure word from the dictionary and announces and spells it to the other players. The chosen word should be one that no other player knows. If a player is familiar with the chosen word, he or she should say so and the picker should choose a different word. (Cheating only gains one point for the cheater anyway.)

If a word has more than one definition listed, the Picker privately chooses which one to use, but in such a case must specify, "X, when it does ''not'' mean thus-and-so."

Each player writes a crafty and credible definition of the word, initials it, and submits it to the word picker. The Picker shuffles the definitions, including his own, which is the correct one. As definitions are handed to him, the picker should check them over to ensure that she can read the [[handwriting]] and to clarify any questions. (Stumbling over or misreading a definition is usually a sign that it's not the correct one -- unless the picker is trying to bluff.) 

Once all definitions have been handed in, the picker reads the list aloud, once. The Picker may read the definitions in any order. On a second reading, each other player in turn then votes for the definition he or she believes is correct. Because she selected the word and knows the definition, the picker does not vote. 

One variation allows a player to vote for the definition he submitted, although he doesn't get points for doing so. (This can encourage other people to vote for that definition as well, and the player would get those points.) Another variation does not allow a player to vote for his own definition.

== Scoring == 
Players earn one point for voting for the correct definition, and one point for each vote cast for the definition they wrote.

The Picker earns three points if no one selects the correct definition.

Play then proceeds with the dictionary going to another player, which starts a new turn. A full circuit of the dictionary constitutes a round.

== Strategy ==
Often simple words (''Strunt'') are more successful than complicated words with detectable [[Latin]] roots.

Phrases like "Any of several..." or "One or more..." sometimes lend authority to definitions. Players may decide beforehand whether fields are to be included: "(''obsolete''), (''Geology''), (''dialect'')," etc. The dictionary might be passed around first, to remind players of its characteristic style.

== Other versions of the game == 

The [[board game]]s [[Balderdash]], [[Dictionary Dabble]] and [[Weird Wordz]] are based on Fictionary. 

Fictionary is featured as a segment on the weekly [[United States|US]] [[National Public Radio]] quiz show ''[[Says You!]]'', where it is known as the bluffing round.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Call My Bluff]] is a popular daytime [[BBC]] television [[panel game]] based on Fictionary.  Two teams of three players (journalists, B and C list celebrities, etc) compete.  A player from one team has to decide between the three proposed definitions provided by the opposing team.  If the first player correctly identifies the true definition of the word, they earn their team a point.  If they are wrong, the team which provided the definitions are awarded the point.  '''Call My Bluff''' was first aired in October [[1965]], with [[Robin Ray]] as chair. Presenter, Robert Robinson, chaired it for many years. [[As of 2003]] the programme is chaired by [[Fiona Bruce]].

One variation uses a book of assorted [[poems]] instead of a dictionary.  A [[rhyming]] [[quatrain]] is chosen by the picker.  The first three lines are read and a fake fourth line must be made up by the other players which acts like the fake definitions.

A variety of Fictionary has been on-line for over 1680 rounds on CompuServe in its Tapcis Forum. It is believed that this game is the longest-running on-line game as it enters its sixteenth year. At the end of May, 2005, the game moved to tapcis.com when CompuServe disconnected the forum.
