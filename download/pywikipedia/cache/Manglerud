'''Manglerud''' was a borough of the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] up to [[January 1]] [[2004]], when it became part of the borough of [[Østensjø]]. Manglerud was built in the [[1960s]] as a suburb to Oslo, connected by the ''[[Oslo T-bane]]'' [[metro]] system.

== Sport ==
Mangleruds [[ice hockey]] team '''Manglerud Star''' has delivered more players to professional hockey leagues around the world than any other hockey teams in Norway. For the [[2004]]/[[2005]] season, Manglerud Star played in the first division after economical problems, being relegated from the ''Eliteserie'', but after the qualification league at the end of the season, they was back at the top level for the [[2005]]/[[2006]] season. After competiting against the 05/06-finalist Trondheim in the eliteserie-qualification, which was surprisingly low-levelled at that season, they was relegated to the level 2-league ''første divisjon'' for 06/07. Many people claim [[Mats Trygg]] to be the best M/S player ever, he was playing for [[Färjestads BK]] in [[Sweden]] during the [[2004]]/[[2005]] season, but plays the [[2005]]/[[2006]] season for [[Iserlohn Roosters]] in [[Germany]], together with his best friend and partner in the national team of Norway [[Martin Knold]]. In 2004, the city of Oslo provided funding for a new sports hall, which also includes a [[soccer|football]] arena beside the hockey hall.
