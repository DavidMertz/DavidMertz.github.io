'''Montezuma''' (9.65&deg; N, 85.07&deg; W) is a town in [[Puntarenas Province]], [[Costa Rica]] which began as a remote [[fishing]] village and has gained popularity since the [[1980s]] among [[tourist]]s on a budget.  Tourists can camp near the beach for a small fee, or stay in a growing number of small hotels in the area. In the summer, which is the rainy season, Montezuma is one of the driest places in the country. This, however, means there will be an average of over one hour of light rain per day. Because of the similarity to the climate of the Mediterranian coast, Montezuma is very popular among Europeans. There is also a large percentage of Rastafarians. The road to Montezuma is considered one of the worst in Costa Rica, but many people find the destination is worth the numerous pot-holes. Secluded beaches can be reached by forest trails on either side of the town. A major attraction is Montezuma waterfall, which is a twenty minute walk from town.  Residents tend to dive off of the 100-foot summit of the waterfall, amazing tourists with their generally death-defying dives.  In fact, there have been a some deaths as result of this practice.
Recommended restaurants are Playa de los Artistas, Cocolores and El Sano Banano. 
While the town's center, in recent years, has become a routine stop for the Costa Rican tourist, the best attributes of the area are found after people stay for days, weeks and sometimes years.
