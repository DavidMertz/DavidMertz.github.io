'''Crewe station''' is one of the most historic [[railway station]]s in the world. It was the first to be built independently of the need to serve a town. Nowadays, as well as serving the town of [[Crewe]] that has grown near it, it still operates as an important junction on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. It also serves as a major rail gateway for [[Cheshire]].

In April 2006, [[Network Rail]] organised its maintenance and train control operations into "26 Routes". The main line through Crewe forms part of Route 18 (The West Coast Main Line).  The line from [[Shrewsbury]] and [[South Wales]] to the junction south of Crewe station is Route 14 (South and Central Wales and Borders). The [[North Wales Coast Line]] to [[Chester]] and [[North Wales]] is Route 22 (North Wales and Borders) and the [[Crewe to Manchester Line]] forms a part of Route 20 (North West Urban). The [[Crewe to Derby Line]] is electrified between Crewe, Kidsgrove and [[Stoke-on-Trent]] to enable it to serve as a diversionary route and therefore forms a part of Route 18.

Crewe currently has 12 platforms in regular use. There is a modern passenger entrance containing a bookseller's and ticket office. Passengers access the platforms via a footbridge, stairs and lifts. The platforms have buildings dating from the 19th century containing two more booksellers, bars, buffets and waiting rooms. The last major expenditure on the station was in 1985, when the entire track layout was remodelled and the station facilities updated during a three-month period when few trains called at the station. There is currently (2005) a "Crewe Gateway" proposal supported by Crewe & Nantwich Borough Council, Cheshire County Council, and the North West Regional Assembly to spend over Â£30 million to bring the station's facilities into the twenty-first century, as illustrated in this Cheshire County Council  [http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/28BC9F45-85EA-47BD-B33F-231CA73D9211/0/Layout_Plan.PDF Station layout] <small>([[PDF]])</small>.

==History==

When it was built, Crewe station was truly unique, and has set many 'firsts'. It was the first station in the world to have its own railway hotel (''The Crewe Arms'', 1838, still in use). It was the first to be completely rebuilt owing to the need for expansion. It was the first to form a junction between more than two companies. It was the first to have a completely independent railway system built around it, to ease traffic congestion.

The story begins on [[4 July]] [[1837]], with the opening of the [[Grand Junction Railway]]. The purpose of this railway was to link the four largest cities of [[England]]  by joining the existing [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] with the projected [[London and Birmingham Railway|London and Birmingham railway]]. The line, which was the first long-distance railway in the world, ran from [[Curzon Street railway station]] in [[Birmingham]] to [[Dallam, Warrington|Dallam]] in [[Warrington]],  Cheshire, where it made  an end-on junction with the Warrington and Newton Railway, a branch of the L&M.

Conceived as a through route, the GJR was not interested in serving towns en-route. [[Wolverhampton]], for instance, was by-passed by half a mile because it did not lie on the intended route, and no central station was built for several years, instead a small station at [[Wednesfield]] Heath (now [[Heath Town]]) was deemed to suffice. But a station was built in the parish of Monks Coppenhall in Cheshire, at the point where the line crossed the [[turnpike trust|turnpike road]] linking the Trent and Mersey and the Shropshire Union Canals. Since the land was bought from the Earl of Crewe, whose mansion stood nearby, the station was called [[Crewe]]. At this time there was no town at this point, only a few scattered dairy farms.

As soon as the station opened it was seen to be at a useful point to begin a branch line to the county town of [[Chester]]. The [[Chester and Crewe Railway]] was formed and was absorbed by the GJR shortly before it opened to traffic in 1840. A locomotive depot was built at the station, to serve the Chester line, and to provide banking engines to assist trains southwards from Crewe up the Madeley Incline, a modest gradient  which was a challenge to the small engines of the day.

By 1841 the Chester line was seen as a starting point for a new trunk line to [[Holyhead]], to provide the fastest route to Ireland, and the importance of Crewe as a junction station began to be established. This was given further endorsement when the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, a separate undertaking which had hoped to build a wholly independent line linking the two cities, shorter than the GJR, decided that it would be uneconomical to compete with that line over the greater part of its length, and decided to divert its own line to meet the GJR at Crewe. Teething squabbles between the companies delayed the running of through services for a while, and the M&B had to build a temporary station of their own, part of which survives today as an isolated platform next to the North Junction, at the start of the line to [[Manchester]].

In 1842 the GJR decided to move its locomotive works from Edge Hill in [[Liverpool]] to Crewe, siting the works to the north of the junction between the Warrington and Chester lines. To house the workforce and company management the town of Crewe was built by the company to the north of the works. 

In 1845 the GJR merged with the London and Birmingham and the Liverpool and Manchester railways to form the [[London and North Western Railway]] Company, which until its demise in 1923 was the largest company in the world. The new company extended the existing lines to Holyhead, the Warrington line to Lancaster and Carlisle, the Manchester line to Leeds, and built a new line to [[Shrewsbury]] to join the Shrewsbury and Hereford lines which provided connections to South Wales. The [[North Staffordshire Railway]] built a line from [[Stoke-on-Trent]], joining the LNWR from the South East. Crewe was therefore the centre of a wide-ranging railway network, and freight-handling facilities grew up to the south of the station.

To cope with the increase of traffic, the station was rebuilt in 1861, the buildings facing each other on the present platforms 5 and 6 dating from this time. At the same time the works was extensively redeveloped and enlarged, and the town also considerably enlarged, under the leadership of [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]], a Stockport man who had become Locomotive Superintendent for the whole company. Locomotive construction, hitherto divided with Wolverton (on the London and Birmingham Railway) was concentrated at Crewe. Ramsbottom also  built a steelworks, the first in the world to make large-scale use of the [[Bessemer process]], as only the LNWR required enough steel to keep a Bessemer plant continuously occupied. He also introduced mass-production techniques, whereby as many parts as possible were identical between one engine and another. 

Ramsbottom retired in 1871 and was succeeded by the legendary [[Francis Webb (engineer)|Frank Webb]], a colourful and controversial figure who was known as 'The Uncrowned King of Crewe'.

By the 1890s Crewe junctions had become so busy that a survey revealed 1,000 trains passing within a 24-hour period. Since half of these were  freight trains which did not need to call at the station, the company decided to build a completely separate four-track railway line passing to the west of the station, joining the existing lines beyond the north and south junctions, burrowing beneath them and  avoiding them completely. This huge undertaking also included a vast [[marshalling yard]] to the south of the station at ''Basford Hall'', a revolutionary 'tranship shed' which allowed fast transfer of freight from wagons to road vehicles under cover, and the increase in the size of the passenger station by one-half again. 

In 1923 the LNWR became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|London, Midland and Scottish railway]] group. Crewe remained the major centre for locomotive construction. In 1938-39 the signal boxes at North and South Junctions were completely reconstructed as massive concrete structures to withstand air raids, and remained in use until the resignalling project in 1985. The North Junction signalbox can now be visited as part of the ''Crewe Heritage Centre''. Although the railway station is virtually synonymous with the town of Crewe, it was not actually incorporated within the borders of the borough of Crewe until the late 1930s, as it lies about 1 mile to the south east of the actual town centre.

With the exception of two new signal boxes and associated greatly improved colour light signalling, track circuiting and electrically operated track points, train operation at Crewe changed little in over fifty years. The trains did become longer and heavier and were hauled by larger engines, which required increased supplies of water to be taken on board before departure, but the number of passenger trains using Crewe Station and the method of operation did not vary greatly despite the passage of two world wars. Trains continued to divide at Crewe with the front portion for Manchester and the rear for Liverpool. The station pilot engine always had a pair of restaurant cars in a bay platform ready to attach to a morning service to London. Always there were extra coaches waiting to be attached to overcrowded trains. In addition to passengers there were vast quantities of mail, parcels and even live animals and birds of all descriptions transported in specially designed transit crates. When necessary the station staff had to feed and water these special passengers, which travelled in copious luggage vans.

In 1948 the LMS was nationalised as [[British Rail|British Railways]], [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]]. Nationalisation greatly facilitated the modernisation of British Railways and after a false start developing new improved steam engines, came electrification, diesel power and fixed formation air-braked trains. These changes had a significant effect on Crewe station. Notably the variation in station use caused firstly by the electrification in stages of the West Coast Main Line between 1959 and 1974 and secondly by the general end of steam traction on Britain's railways. Following the completion of Electrification in 1974, trains did not need to change locomotives at Crewe, except for the London to Chester and Holyhead service. Many locomotive hauled trains were replaced by electric or diesel multiple unit trains, with much faster turn-round times. Additionally, two local branch lines had closed, which resulted in fewer trains terminating at Crewe. However, compensating for the decline of local passenger traffic, the reduction in mail and parcels traffic and the total elimination of livestock carriage, came the great increase in inter-city passenger traffic and the need for even faster, smoother and more efficient handling of passenger trains.

In 1985 the entire track layout was modernised, simplified and reduced, eliminating a vast array of points and crossings and allowing 80 mph running over the North Junction. At the same time all but one (platform 12, illustrated above) of the six 1902 extension platforms were taken out of use.

[[Crewe Works]], the [[Crewe Diesel TMD|diesel locomotive depot]] & the [[Crewe Electric TMD|electric locomotive depot]] are all situated nearby.

In the [[Strategic Rail Authority|SRA's]] 2002/03 financial year 773,969 people joined the railway system at Crewe station, and 763,846 left it there (tickets sold at Crewe, and tickets sold to Crewe; figure does not include passengers interchanging between one rail service and another). <ref> The usage information (Station Entries and Station Exits) is based on ticket sales in the financial year 2002/03 and covers all National Rail stations. It does not include those stations that are owned by TfL. The calculation of station usage levels uses sales recorded in the railway ticketing system prior to their allocation to individual operators. It does not take into account any changes of train during the course of a journey. The ticketing system does not record certain journeys made using TfL bought travelcards, TfL Freedom Passes, staff travel passes and certain other PTE specific products.
