A '''best practice exchange''' is an effort to find and share [[best practices]] in a particular industry or other professional field.  

Any [[instructional capital]] might be exchanged, by any means, though Internet-related information is most commonly exchanged this way:
*[[source code]]
*[[e-democracy]]
*[[e-government]]

There are numerous such efforts now in government especially in the English speaking world:
*[[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] [[FCM InfraGuide]]
*[[U.S. government]] [[Government Open Code Collaborative]]
*[[UK local democracy project]] which calls this a '''knowledge pool''' [http://www.e-democracy.gov.uk/knowledgepool/]
