There are a number of [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s based on, or descended from, the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) series of [[UNIX]] variants. The three most notable descendants in current use are [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], which are all derived from [[4.4BSD]]. Other notable derivatives include the FreeBSD-based [[DragonFly BSD]] and [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Mac OS X]] with its [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] base and [[userland]] derived from FreeBSD. 

Most current BSD operating systems are usually available for download, free of charge, under the [[BSD License]], the most notable exception being Mac OS X. They also generally use a [[monolithic kernel]] architecture, apart from Mac OS X and DragonFly BSD which feature [[hybrid kernel]]s.

The various BSD projects generally develop the kernel and [[userland]] programs and libraries together, the source code being managed using a single central source repository.

== Names, logos, and slogans ==

[[Image:BSD-daemon-rendering.png|thumb|right|100px|FreeBSD's mascot.]]
[[Image:NetBSD.png|thumb|right|100px|NetBSD's logo.]]
The names FreeBSD and OpenBSD are references to software freedom: both in cost and [[open source]]. NetBSD's name<ref>[http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/about.html#name About the NetBSD Project - Why the name?]. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> is a tribute to the [[Internet]], which brought the original developers together.

The first BSD mascot was the [[BSD daemon]], named after a common type of [[Unix]] software program, a [[daemon]]. FreeBSD still uses the image, a red cartoon devil named Beastie, wielding a pitchfork, as its mascot today. In 2005, after a competition<ref>[http://logo-contest.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD Logo Competition]. Competition ended June 30, 2005. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> a stylized version Beastie's head was chosen as the FreeBSD logo.

The NetBSD flag, designed in 2004 by Grant Bisset, is inspired by a [[World War II]] photograph, [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]. Some people believed this had negative cultural ramifications<ref>[http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2004/01/14/0001.html NetBSD logo design competition]. Also see [http://www.netbsd.org/Foundation/press/new-logo.html the results of the competition.] January 14, 2004 and October 30, 2004. Visited April 22, 2006</ref> and was not a suitable image for NetBSD in the corporate world, so the new, flatter, abstract flag design was selected. The original logo<ref>[http://www.netbsd.org/images/NetBSD-old.jpg Original NetBSD Logo.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref>, designed in 1994 by Shawn Mueller, included a number of BSD daemons raising the flag on top of a mound of computer equipment. 

[[Image:Openbsd.png|thumb|left|180px|OpenBSD's logo.]]Originally, OpenBSD used the BSD daemon as a mascot, but later replaced it with [[Puffy (mascot)|Puffy]]. Although Puffy is usually referred to as a [[pufferfish]], the spikes on the cartoon images give him a closer likeness to the [[porcupinefish]]. The logo is a reference to the fish's defensive capabilities and to the [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]] cryptography algorithm used in OpenBSD. OpenBSD also has a number of slogans including "Secure by default," and "Power. Security. Flexibility." and has released an original song with every release since 3.0<ref>[http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html OpenBSD release song lyrics]. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref>.

The DragonFly BSD logo, designed by Joe Angrisano, is a [[dragonfly]] named [[:Image:DragonFlyBSD-Logo.png|Fred]]. A number of unofficial logos<ref>[http://wiki.dragonflybsd.org/index.php/DragonFly_Artwork DFWiki - DragonFly Artwork]. Last updated March 28, 2006. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> by various authors also show the dragonfly or stylized versions of it. DragonFly BSD considers itself to be "the logical continuation of the FreeBSD 4.x series."<ref>[http://www.dragonflybsd.org/about/history.cgi The History of Dragonfly]. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> [[FireflyBSD]] has a similar logo, a [[:Image:FireflyBSD-logo.png|firefly]], showing its close relationship to DragonFly BSD. In fact, the FireflyBSD website states that proceeds from sales will go to the development of DragonFly BSD, suggesting that the two may in fact be very closely related.

[[PicoBSD]]'s slogan is "For the little BSD in all of us," and its logo includes a version of FreeBSD's Beastie as a child<ref>[http://people.freebsd.org/~picobsd/images/picobsdbanner.gif PicoBSD Banner - For the little BSD in all of us.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref>, showing its close connection to FreeBSD, and the minimal amount of code needed to run as a [[LiveCD]]. 

A number of BSD OSes use stylized version of their respective names for logos. This includes Mac OS X (which only uses the [[:Image:Mac_OS_X_Tiger_Logo.jpg|X]]), [[:Image:PC-BSD_logo.png|PC-BSD]], [[:Image:DesktopBSD.png|DesktopBSD]] (with a symbol on the side), ClosedBSD (curved into a semicircle<ref>[http://www.closedbsd.org/images/logo.jpg ClosedBSD logo.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref>), Frenzy<ref>[http://frenzy.org.ua/frenzy-logosite.png Frenzy logo.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> (with symbol on the side), and [[MicroBSD]] (which includes a bull-like M with yellow eyes<ref>[http://www.microbsd.net/images/logo.png MicroBSD logo - The small secure unix like OS.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref>). The Mac OS X logo is the [[Roman numeral]] for 10. This is intended to emphasize the change from previous versions of [[Mac OS]], which were not based on BSD and had version numbers expressed using [[Arabic numeral]]s. PC-BSD's slogan is "Personal computing, served up BSD style!", DesktopBSD's  "A Step Towards BSD on the Desktop." MicroBSD's slogan is "The small secure unix like OS."

[[MirOS]]'s site<ref>[http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/ MirOS/MirPorts: a wonderful operating system for a world of peace.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> collects a variety of BSD mascots and [[Tux]], the [[Linux]] mascot, together, illustrating the project's aim of supporting both BSD and Linux kernels. MirOS's slogan is "a wonderful operating system for a world of peace." [[:Image:Ekkobutton1.jpg|ekkoBSD's logo]] is the name "ekkoBSD" in a green circle.

== Philosophies ==

The aim of the FreeBSD project is to produce an operating system usable for any purpose.<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#FREEBSD-GOALS FreeBSD FAQ 1.2. - What is the goal of the FreeBSD Project?] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> FreeBSD is intended to run a wide variety of applications, be easy to use, contain cutting edge features, and be able to handle heavy-load servers. FreeBSD is free and open source, and the project prefers the BSD license. However, they do sometimes accept [[Non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure agreements]] (NDAs) and include closed-source binaries in their source tree, in order to support the hardware of companies who do not provide public documentation about their products.

OpenBSD focuses on security, correctness, and being as free as possible.<ref>[http://www.openbsd.org/goals.html OpenBSD Project Goals.] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> Security policies include revealing security flaws publicly, known as [[full disclosure]]; thoroughly [[auditing]] code for bugs and security issues; various security features, including the [[W^X]] page protection technology and heavy use of randomisation; a "[[secure by default]]" philosophy including disabling all non-essential services and sane initial settings; and integrated [[cryptography]], originally made easier due to relaxed [[Canadian]] export laws in comparison to the [[United States]]. Concerning software freedom, OpenBSD prefers the BSD or [[Internet Software Consortium|ISC]] license, with the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] acceptable only for existing software which is impractical to replace, such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. NDAs are almost never considered acceptable. This has led to the foundation of a number of child projects to replace restricted alternatives, including [[OpenSSH]] and [[Common Address Redundancy Protocol|CARP]], as well as campaigns to persuade hardware vendors to release documentation. In common with its parent, NetBSD, OpenBSD strives to run on a wide variety of hardware.

NetBSD's primary aim is portability.<ref>[http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/about.html About the NetBSD Project - What is the NetBSD project?] Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> It runs on a large number of hardware systems and interoperates well with many others. The NetBSD project prefers the NetBSD license, and tries to avoid encumbering licenses when possible. NetBSD seeks to be well-designed, stable, and fast, and to conform to open standards when practical.

DragonFly BSD focuses on being inherently easy to understand and develop for multi-processor capable infrastructures.<ref>[http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2004/07/08/dragonfly_bsd_interview.html?page=1 Behind DragonFly BSD]. ''An Interview with the developers.'' Federico Biancuzzi. July 8, 2004. Vistited April 29, 2006.</ref> They also focus on kernel performance in general.

== Popularity ==
[[Image:Bsdusage.gif|right|350px|thumb|Results of a BSD usage survey. The question allowed participants to check more than one OS. The percentages around the graph are out of the total answers; the percentages in the key are out of the total participants.]]
The BSD Certification Group, after advertising on a number of mailing lists, surveyed 4330 BSD users, 3958 of whom took the survey in English.<ref>[http://www.bsdcertification.org/ BSD Certification site]; [[PDF]] of [http://www.bsdcertification.org/downloads/pr_20051031_usage_survey_en_en.pdf usage survey results]. Visited April 22, 2006.</ref> Other languages offered were Brazilian and European Portuguese, German, Italian, and Polish. Note that there was no control group or pre-screening of the survey takers. Those who checked "Other" were asked to specify that operating system. Note that the operating system survey takers filled in for "other" may or may not be considered BSD operating systems by most people.

Note that because survey takers were permitted to select more than one answer, the percentages shown in the key, which are out of the total survey takers (4330), add up to greater than 100%. The percentages shown around the chart, which were used to size the sections, are out of the total answers (5860). Note that if a survey taker filled in more than one choice for "other", this is still only counted as one vote for other on this chart.

The Distrowatch website<ref>[http://distrowatch.com/ Distrowatch: Put the fun back into computing]</ref>, well-known in the Linux community and often used as a reference for popularity, publishes page hits for each of the Linux distributions and other operating systems it covers. As of December 10, 2005 it places FreeBSD in 11 place with 493 hits per day and OpenBSD in 38th place, but fairly close to the average with 137 hits per day. A number of Linux distributions range between them.

{{fnb|1}}According to an [http://www.freebsd.org/releases/6.1R/announce.html announcement] on the FreeBSD website, version 6.1 was released on Mon, 08 May 2006 18:40:04 -0700. In UTC, this is 09 May 2006 3:40:04. <br \>
{{fnb|2}}SunOS 5.x refers to the core of the [[Solaris Operating Environment]] (Solaris 2 onwards), despite its very different origins compared to previous SunOS releases.<br \>
{{fnb|3}} SunOS and Ultrix are both historic operating systems that are no longer developed. BSDeviant and ekkoBSD don't exist anymore either, although there is a site where you can download BSDeviant (see external links). MicroBSD ended, started again in 2003, but it does not seem that any progress has been made since then, though the website still exists.

{{fnb|4}} [[Unix File System|UFS]] and [[Unix File System|UFS2]] are descendants of the old [[Berkeley Fast File System|FFS]]. However, many BSD operating systems refer to UFS1 as FFS.<br />
{{fnb|5}} Operating systems where the GUI is not installed and turned on by default are often bundled with an implementation of the [[X Window System]]. However, installing X is usually optional.<br />
{{fnb|6}} Most operating systems use proprietary APIs in addition to any supported standards.<br />
{{fnb|7}} OpenBSD's NTFS support is not enabled by default and requires a custom kernel.<br />
{{fnb|8}} OpenBSD contains some support for modules but only on the i386 and amd64 architectures. They are used only to add third-party features: extracting existing functions into modules in the same manner as FreeBSD is not possible.<br />
{{fnb|9}} Unlike NetBSD and FreeBSD, OpenBSD includes the [[X Window System]] as base install sets rather than packages within the [[ports collection]]. It includes some local changes and is managed as part of the OpenBSD source tree.
