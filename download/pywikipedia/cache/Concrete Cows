The '''''Concrete Cows''''' in [[Milton Keynes]], [[England]] are an iconic work [[sculpture]], created in [[1978]] by [[Canada|Canadian]]-born artist, [[Liz Leyh]].  There are three [[cow]]s and three [[calf|calves]].

The work is among the earliest examples of [[conceptual art]]: the artist was poking fun at the preconceived notion of the [[new city]], held by commentators who had never seen the place, that it would consist entirely of concrete pavements where once there were fields, and where its deprived children would need models to know how real cows once looked.  The reality of course was different: [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation]] was building "a city in the forest", with substantially more open green space than found in traditional cities.  Furthermore, there are real farms with real cows within 2 miles/3 km of the site, and the cows are currently located in a real field.

The [[London]] media was not yet ready for conceptual art: the tabloids' preconceptions were confirmed rather than denied and radio [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Noel Edmonds]] regularly made jibes about them.

On their site in a public park, the ''Cows'' have suffered many indignities &mdash; though it could be argued that these were consistent with their conceptual origins.  They have been painted pink, become [[zebra]]s, had pyjama bottoms added, have been beheaded in the style of [[Damien Hirst]], have acquired [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|BSE]] (mad cow disease) [[graffiti]], had one of the calves kidnapped (with ransom notes to the local papers).  One of the ''Cows'' briefly enjoyed the services of a [[papier-mâché]] bull.  When UK Culture Minister [[Kim Howells]] referred to modern art trends as "conceptual bullshit", the ''Cows'' acquired concrete cow-pats.  Local legend has it that the ears of the ''Cows'' have shrunk over the years, as more protruding versions have been knocked off by enthusiastic riders.

To the outrage [http://news.scotsman.com/arts.cfm?id=2233972005] of the Scots (with no representatives in the list) the Milton Keynes ''Concrete Cows'' have been short-listed among the 100 best works of sculpture in Britain.  The list was prepared for [[Sky Television]]'s  ''Artsworld'' channel, for a programme to be shown in December 2005.

* The ''Cows'' are not actually made of concrete.  They were assembled from bits and scraps, and skinned with [[fibre glass]] reinforced [[glossary of sculpting terms#ciment fondu|ciment fondu]].
