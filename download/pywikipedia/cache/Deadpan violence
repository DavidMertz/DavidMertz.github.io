'''Deadpan violence''' is used to describe a sentence, group of sentences, phrase or action that involves someone threatening violence in an unemotional, detached way. 

This may be done to create a comic effect, by being out of place and in an unrealistic context.

Examples in television can be found in the dialogue of [[Stewie Griffin]] ([[Family Guy]]) and many other creations. It takes the right situation and a certain amount of skill to pull off successfully, but can be very effective when well used.
