It is one of the most famous spiral galaxies in the sky.  The galaxy and its companion ([[NGC 5195]]) are easily observed by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]], and the two galaxies may even be seen with [[binoculars]]{{citation needed}}.  The Whirlpool Galaxy is also a popular target for professional astronomers, who study it to further understand galaxy structure (particularly structure associated with the [[spiral arm]]s) and galaxy interactions. 

==Discovery==
The Whirlpool Galaxy was discovered by [[Charles Messier]] on [[October 13]], [[1773]]. Its companion galaxy, [[NGC 5195]], was discovered in [[1781]] by [[Pierre Méchain]]. Only by 1845 did the Whirlpool Galaxy become the first to be recognized as a spiral. This was achieved at [[Birr Castle]], Ireland, where the [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|third Earl of Rosse]] constructed a 72 inch reflector.  In [[2005]] a [[supernova]] ([[SN 2005cs]]) was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at [[apparent magnitude]] 14.<ref>{{cite web | last = MacRobert | first = Alan M. | year = [[August 24]] [[2005]] | url = http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1544_1.asp | title = Supernova in M51 | work = Sky Tonight | publisher =Sky and Telescope  | accessdate = August 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Bishop | first = David | url = http://www.supernovae.net/sn2005/sn2005cs.html | title = Supernova 2005cs in M51 | work = supernovae.net | accessdate = August 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.  Sometimes M51 is used to refer to the pair of galaxies, in which case the individual galaxies may be referred to as ''M51A'' (NGC 5194) and ''M51B'' (NGC 5195).

==Properties==

With the recent SN 2005cs derived estimate of 23 Mly distance, and an angular diameter of roughly 11&prime;.2, we can infer that M51's bright circular disk has a diameter of about ~38,000 light-years. Its mass is estimated to be 160 billion solar masses. Compared to 100 kly diameter of the Milky Way, M51 has about half its size and mass.

[[Image:M51_whirlpool_galaxy_black_hole.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"X" across the nucleus of M51 indicating two dust rings around the black hole at the center of the galaxy.]]A [[black hole]] surrounded by a ring of dust exists at the heart of the spiral.  The dust ring stands almost perpendicular to the relatively flat spiral galaxy.  A secondary ring crosses the primary ring on a different axis, a phenomenon that is contrary to expectations.  A pair of [[ionization cone]]s extend from the axis of the main dust ring.<ref>{{cite web | year = [[June 8]] [[1992]] | url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1992/17/text/ | title = NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Resolves a Dark "x" Across the Nucleus of M51 | work = News Center | publisher = HubbleSite | accessdate = August 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

==Visual appearance==

Located within the constellation [[Canes Venatici]], M51 is easy to find by following the easternmost star of the [[Big Dipper]], [[Eta Ursae Majoris]], and going 3.5° southeast. Its declination is +47°, so it is circumpolar for observers located above 43°N latitude and reaches high altitudes throughout the northern hemisphere making it an accessible object, especially from the very early hours in winter through the end of spring season, after which [[summer solstice]] somewhat hinders observations.

M51 is visible through binoculars on a dark night, but with modern amateur telescopes this galaxy is truly a sight to behold. It is very forgiving on the instrument, when seen even through a humble 10 cm telescope the basic outlines of M51 and its companion are visible. Under dark skies and seen with a moderate eyepiece through a 15 cm telescope one can detect M51's intrinsic spiral structure. With larger (>30 cm) instruments M51 is simply breathtaking. The various spiral bands are very obvious and several [[HII regions]] appear to be visible, and M51 can be seen to be attached to M51B.

As is usual for galaxies, the true extent of its size can only be gathered from inspecting deep photographs, and very long exposures reveal a pretty large nebula extending beyond the visible circular appearance.    

In January 2005 the Hubble Heritage Team constructed a 11477x7965 pixel composite image (shown in the info box above) of M51 using Hubble's ACS instrument, revealing this splendid galaxy and its companion in unprecedented detail<ref>{{cite web | year = [[April 25]] [[2005]] | url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/12/image/a | title = Out of This Whirl: the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and Companion Galaxy | work = News Center | publisher = HubbleSite | accessdate = August 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

==Spiral structure==

The very pronounced spiral structure of the Whirlpool Galaxy is believed to be the result of the close interaction between it and its companion galaxy [[NGC 5195]].

==Star formation==

Induced spiral structure in the larger galaxy isn't the only effect of the interaction. Significant compression of hydrogen gas occurs that leads to the development of starbirth regions. In pictures of M51 these show up as the bright blue 'knots' throughout the spiral arms. 

Generally speaking, hydrogen gas is the most common component of the [[interstellar medium]] (the vast space between stars & planetary systems in galaxies). It exists primarily in its atomic and molecular form, and forms huge clouds throughout the entire galaxy. When large sources of gravitational pull pass nearby, such as other galaxies, gravitational interactions produce compression (density) waves that sweep through these hydrogen clouds. This causes some regions of the previously diffuse gas to compress into tight pockets of opaque and dense gas, these are dust lanes one so often sees in the spiral arms. In regions where the concentration and density of gas reaches a critical value, further collapse under its own gravitational pull occurs, and stars are born at the center of the collapse, where the gas is compressed so strongly that [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] initiates. 

When this happens, these new-born stars gobble up huge amounts of gas causing them to expand, shine even hotter, and finally sweep away the surrounding layers of dust and gas by increasing efflux of the solar wind. The gigantic proportions of the clouds out of which they are born means stars seldom, if ever, are created in isolation. Thus regions of several hot young stars emit sufficient light energy that they can be seen in the high resolution pictures of M51 across millions of lightyears distance.

For an example of such a formation in our own galaxy, see M16, the [[Eagle Nebula]].

==Companion==

Decades ago, it wasn't known for certain if the companion galaxy NGC 5195 was actually a true companion or rather some other galaxy passing at a distance. The advent of radio astronomy and subsequent radio images of M51 unequivocally demonstrated the reality of the interaction. 

Recent simulations bear out that M51's spiral structure was caused by NGC 5195 passing through the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. In this model<ref name="Salo & Laurikainen">{{cite journal

NGC 5195 comes from behind M51 through the disk towards the observer, made another disk crossing as recently as 50 to 100 Myrs ago until it is where we observe it to be now, slightly behind M51.
