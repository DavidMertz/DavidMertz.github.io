}}'''William Jefferson Clinton''', (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III''' on [[August 19]] [[1946]]) was the 42nd [[President of the United States]], serving from 1993 to 2001. Clinton served five terms as the [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas]]. His wife, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], is presently in her first term as the [[Junior senator|junior U.S. Senator]] from [[New York]]. 

Generally regarded as a [[moderate]] and a member of the moderate [[New Democrat]] wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he headed the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]] in 1990 and 1991. During his tenure as president, his domestic priorities included efforts to create a universal healthcare system, to improve [[education]], to restrict [[pistol|handgun]] sales, to balance the federal budget, to strengthen [[environmentalism|environmental]] regulations, to improve race relations, and to protect the jobs of workers during pregnancy or medical emergency. His domestic agenda also included other themes such as reforming welfare programs, expanding the "[[War on Drugs]]", and increasing [[law enforcement]] funding. [[Foreign relations of the United States|Internationally]], his priorities included reducing [[trade barrier]]s, preventing [[nuclear proliferation]], and mediating the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] and [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]s. 

Clinton was the third-youngest president, behind [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (the youngest) and [[John F. Kennedy]] (the youngest ''elected''). He was the first [[Post-WW2 baby boom|baby boomer]] president and the first Democratic president to be re-elected since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. The Clinton/Gore ticket of 1992 was the youngest in history, with a combined age of 90 (Clinton was 46, Vice Presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] was 44). Clinton was one of only two Presidents in American history to be [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached]], and was acquitted by a vote of the [[United States Senate]] on [[February 12]], [[1999]]. In both runs for the Presidency of the USA, Clinton never received a majority of the popular vote, though he ended his Presidential career with a 65% approval rating, the highest end-of-term approval rating of any President in the post-[[Eisenhower]] era. <ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/poll_clintonlegacy010117.html Historical Presidential Approval Ratings], [[abcnews.go.com]], accessed [[February 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Early life==
Clinton was born '''William Jefferson Blythe III'''<!-- Authoritative birthname. See Talk page for more information. -->; in [[Hope, Arkansas]], and raised in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. He was named after his father, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], a traveling salesman who had been killed in an auto accident three months before his son was born. His mother, born [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (1923–1994), remarried in 1950 to [[Roger Clinton, Sr.|Roger Clinton]]. Roger Clinton owned an automobile dealership business with his brother, Raymond Clinton. The young Billy, as he was called, was raised by his mother and stepfather, assuming his last name "Clinton" throughout elementary school, but not formally changing it until he was 14. Clinton grew up in a traditional, albeit blended, family; however, according to Clinton, his stepfather was a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused Clinton's mother, and sometimes Clinton's half-brother [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger, Jr.]].

Clinton was a member of the Masonic Youth Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]], but never became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].

While at [[Hot Springs High School]], Clinton was an excellent student and a talented [[saxophonist]]. He considered dedicating his life to music, but a visit to the White House of President John F. Kennedy, following his election as a [[Boys Nation]] Senator, led him to pursue a career in politics.

Clinton received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Foreign Service b (B.S.F.S.) degree from the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington D.C.]], where he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]], worked for Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to the [[University of Oxford]], ([[University College, Oxford|University College]]) in England. While at Oxford he played [[rugby union]] as a [[Rugby union positions#4. & 5. Lock|lock]], later in life he played for The Little Rock Rugby club in his home state of Arkansas.

After attending Oxford, Clinton obtained a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. While at Yale, he met a classmate who would eventually be his wife, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham]]; the couple married in 1975. Their only child, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], was born in 1980.

==Arkansas political career==
In 1974, his first year as a [[University of Arkansas]] law professor, Clinton ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The incumbent, [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], defeated Clinton with 52% of the vote. In 1976, Clinton was elected [[Attorney General]] of [[Arkansas]] without opposition in the general election.

In 1978, Bill Clinton was first elected [[Governor of Arkansas|governor of the state of Arkansas]], the youngest to be elected governor since 1938. His first term was fraught with difficulties, including an unpopular motor vehicle tax and popular anger over the escape of Cuban prisoners (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chafee]] in 1980.

In the 1980 election, Clinton was defeated in his bid for a second term by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]]. As he once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history. But in 1982, Clinton won his old job back, and over the next decade helped Arkansas transform its economy. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform, smaller government, and other ideas that reached out to Democrats and Republicans alike.

Clinton's approach mollified conservative criticism during his terms as governor. However, personal and business transactions made by the Clintons during this period became the basis of the [[Whitewater scandal|Whitewater]] investigation, which dogged his later presidential administration. After very extensive investigation over several years, no indictments of any kind were made against either of the Clintons growing out of their Arkansas years.

==Presidency==
===1992 Presidential Campaign===
Clinton's first foray into national politics occurred when he was enlisted to speak at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], introducing candidate [[Michael Dukakis]]. Clinton's address, scheduled to last 15 minutes, lasted over half an hour. <ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/15/potus.speech/ Clinton touts success, boosts Gore in nostalgic farewell to Democratic convention] - Mike Ferullo, [[CNN]], [[August 15]], [[2000]]</ref> Toward the end of the speech, conventioneers began chanting “Get off!” The speech drew cheers only when Clinton uttered the words, “in conclusion.” Clinton later poked fun at himself on [[Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson's]] [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]] by saying that the speech "had not been my finest hour, not even my finest hour and a half." 

Four years later, Clinton prepared for a run in 1992 against incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]]. In the aftermath of the [[Persian Gulf War]], Bush seemed unbeatable, and several potential Democratic candidates — notably [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] — passed on what seemed to be a lost cause. Clinton won the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party's]] nomination.

Clinton chose [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Al Gore|Albert A. Gore Jr.]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Tennessee]]) to be his running mate on [[July 9]] [[1992]]. Initially this decision sparked criticism from strategists due to the fact that Gore was from Clinton's neighboring state of [[Tennessee]] which would go against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. In retrospect, many now view Gore as a helpful factor in the 1992 campaign.

Many character issues were raised during the campaign, including allegations that Clinton had dodged the draft during the [[Vietnam War]], and had used [[marijuana]], which Clinton claimed he had pretended to smoke, but "didn't inhale". Allegations of extramarital affairs and shady business deals were also raised. Clinton displayed the resiliency in the face of scandal that would later be pivotal in his presidency. As the candidate with the most money and the best-articulated campaign strategy&nbsp;— creating more jobs&nbsp;— Clinton was able to stay in the race the longest, fending off all rivals long before the Democratic convention. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/candidates/campaign.96/index2.html Campaign '96 Ads] - [[CNN]], accessed [[February 25]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Election===
[[Image:Clinton.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Official Presidential Portrait of President Bill Clinton.]]
Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.01% of the vote) against Republican [[George H. W. Bush]] (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire populist [[Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]] who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote), largely on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a large part of his success was due to George H.W. Bush's steep decline in public approval. Previously described as "unbeatable" due to his approval ratings in the 80 percent range during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf conflict]], Bush saw his public approval rating drop to just over 40% by election time.

Clinton's victory came about for several reasons. The [[Late 1980s recession|recession of 1992]] caused job losses in the white collar sector, and this fueled strong discontent with Bush, who to many voters seemed out of touch, and overly focused on foreign affairs. By contrast, the highly telegenic Clinton appeared to voters as sympathetic, and more in touch with ordinary families.

Bush's reneging on his promise not to raise taxes was exploited by the Clinton campaign. In his acceptance speech at the Republican Convention of 1988, Bush had famously proclaimed: "[[Read my lips: no new taxes|Read my lips ... No new taxes.]]" Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush's failure to keep this promise. His campaign ran ads hinting that the failure reflected on Bush's character. 

Finally, Bush's coalition was in disarray. Ross Perot's independent campaign played to moderates' concerns about the budget deficit, siphoning crucial swing votes from Bush.  Previously, conservatives had been united by anti-communism; with the end of the Cold War, old rivalries re-emerged. The Republican Convention of 1992 was dominated by evangelical Christians, and this alarmed some moderate voters, who thought the Republican Party had been taken over by religious conservatives.<ref>Mark Silk. ''Spiritual Politics: Religion and America Since World War 11''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988, p. 160. [http://are.as.wvu.edu/lebeau1.htm]</ref> All this worked in Clinton's favor. Clinton could point to his moderate, 'New Democrat' record as Governor of Arkansas. Liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's academic credentials, his 1960s-era protest record, and support for social causes such as a woman's right to abortion. The Reagan Democrats who had supported Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their allegiance to the more moderate candidate, Clinton.

Clinton was the first Democrat to serve two full terms as president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. His election ended an era in which the Republican party had controlled the [[White House]] for 12 consecutive years, and for 20 of the previous 24 years. That election also brought the Democrats full control of the political branches of the federal government, including both houses of [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] as well as the presidency, for the first time since the administration of the last Democratic president, [[Jimmy Carter]].

===Significant events of the first term===
[[Image:ClintonGore2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Clinton and Vice President Gore talk while walking through the Colonnade at the White House.]]

Shortly after taking office, Clinton fulfilled a campaign promise by signing the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow their employees to take unpaid leave because of pregnancy or serious medical condition. While this action was popular, Clinton's initial reluctance to fulfill another campaign promise relating to the acceptance of openly [[homosexuality|homosexual]] members of the [[military]] garnered criticism from both the left (for being too tentative in promoting [[gay rights]]) and the right (for being too insensitive to military life). During the campaign, Clinton had promised to lift the ban on gays serving their country. Instead, after much debate, Clinton implemented the "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" policy, which still remains in effect, stating that homosexual men and women may serve in the military as long as their sexuality is kept secret;  By 1999, Clinton said he didn't "think any serious person could say" that the policy was not "out of whack". <ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html President seeks better implementation of 'don't ask, don't tell'] - [[CNN]], [[December 11]], [[1999]]</ref> Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise simply to get votes and contributions. <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 Stranger Among Friends. - book reviews] - John Cloud, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', November 1996</ref>,
<ref>[http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/PressClips/03_0110_WashingtonBladeEd.htm Washington Blade Editorial: Bush Has Mandate to Let Gays Serve] - Kevin Naff, [[Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military]], [[January 10]], [[2003]]</ref> These advocates felt Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S Truman ended segregation of the armed forces in that manner. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the then-Democrat-controlled Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it even harder to integrate the military in the future.

Clinton pushed another controversial issue during this period: that of free trade. In 1993, Clinton supported the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] for ratification by the US Senate. Despite being negotiated by his Republican predecessor, Clinton (along with most of his Democratic Leadership Committee allies) strongly supported free trade measures. Though the measure was opposed by some anti-trade Republicans, most of the opposition came from protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. Ultimately, the treaty was ratified, a major legislative victory.

Clinton also signed into law the [[Brady Bill]], which imposes a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases so that background checks can be done to help keep handguns away from criminals. President Clinton expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], which benefits [[working class]] families with dependent children.

The most important item on Clinton's legislative agenda, however, was [[Clinton health care plan|a complex health care reform plan]], the result of a taskforce headed by [[Hillary Clinton]], aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. Despite his party holding a majority in the House and Senate, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.

Two months later, after two years of Democratic party control under Clinton's leadership, the [[U.S. House election, 1994|mid-term elections in 1994]] proved disastrous for the Democrats. They lost control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years, in large part due to the failed attempt to create a comprehensive health care system.

===Significant events of the second term===
After the 1994 election, the spotlight shifted to the [[Contract with America]] spearheaded by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]]. This initiative presented a blanket of traditional Republican proposals, plus a number of anti-corruption measures. Without a friendly legislative body, Clinton shifted from pushing new policy to blocking the Republican (GOP) agenda.

In August of 1993, Clinton had signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] which passed Congress without a single Republican vote.  It significantly raised taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, without providing middle class tax cuts as he promised during the campaign. But more importantly, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years, and put spending restraints in place. The Republicans objected vociferously, claiming that it would wreck the economy. In November of 1994, the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. They were furious at being strait jacketed into spending cuts by the bill, but they couldn't ignore it without appearing to be softer on deficit spending than the Democrats. 

In 1996,  the GOP passed a budget with significant spending cuts thinking that Clinton could either sign the bill (a major political defeat) or veto it (resulting in a shutdown of most government services). GOP leaders believed that their recently energized supporters would stand with them, while the shutdown would be blamed on Clinton's veto of the spending bills. Clinton instead vetoed the bills and staged a media blitz, rallying his constituencies to blame the shutdown on the Republicans. The public largely agreed with Clinton's interpretation of the situation, and the Republicans suffered a major political defeat. The perception that the congressional Republicans were dangerous radicals stayed with them for the remainder of the Clinton presidency, and Clinton repeatedly made skillful use of this perception to pass his initiatives while blocking theirs.

Clinton cleverly managed the other major challenge posed by the Contract with America: that of [[welfare reform]]. The welfare system, unpopular with middle-class voters, was a major target of the Republicans. However, rather than present the programs as inefficient, bureaucratic and expensive, as they had (unsuccessfully) done in the past, their new tactic was to focus on the success of welfare in its stated goal: fighting poverty. In this they were more successful. Using statistics often compiled by welfare advocates to demand more spending, they pointed to a widening gap between rich and poor and the emergence of a dependent welfare "underclass." Under their proposed welfare reform, individuals could not receive benefits for more than five years. States, meanwhile, would receive "block grants" of federal funds that they would be free to spend on anti-poverty initiatives as they wished, rather than according to federal rules. This amounted to a major shift in welfare policy, and was bitterly contested by Democrats. Clinton, however, supported the plan (to the fury and astonishment of even some members of his Cabinet). In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it". He later signed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996.

This proved to be a major political victory, and a vindication of his strategy of "triangulation." Republicans were robbed of the issue with which they were getting the best traction, while Clinton was presented as a fair-minded, mainstream moderate. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]] a few months later, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican [[Bob Dole]] (40.7% of the popular vote) and [[Reform Party USA|Reform]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] (8.4% of the popular vote). The Republicans lost a few seats, but overall retained control of the Congress.

Throughout 1998, there was a controversy over Clinton's relationship with a young White House intern, [[Monica Lewinsky]]. Clinton initially denied having any improper relationship with Lewinsky. After it was revealed that investigators had obtained a semen-stained dress as well as testimony from Lewinsky, Clinton admitted that an improper relationship with Lewinsky had taken place. He apologized to the nation for his actions, agreed to pay a $25,000 court fine, settled his sexual harassment lawsuit with [[Paula Jones]] for $850,000 and was disbarred from practicing law in Arkansas and before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was not tried for nor found guilty of perjury in a court.

In a [[lame duck]] session after the 1998 elections, the Republican-controlled House voted to impeach Clinton.  The next year, the Senate voted to acquit Clinton of the charges brought against him. 

In the closing year of his Administration, Clinton attempted to address the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. After initial successes such as the Oslo accords of the early 90's, the situation had quietly deteriorated, breaking down completely with the start of the [[Second Intifada]]. Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] together at [[Camp David]]. However, these negotiations proved unsuccessful. Critics charged Clinton with trying to "shoot the moon" to benefit his historical legacy, but instead making the situation worse with a botched negotiation. Supporters consider Clinton to have attempted to address new tensions from the recent outbreak of violence at its root causes, and that Clinton can hardly be blamed for a centuries-old conflict. Some further argue that the perception that Arafat walked away from an offer that supposedly contained all of his previously stated demands enabled the US to pursue a more pro-Israel policy in later years.

Despite occasional political troubles, Clinton remained popular with the American people. In addition to his political skills, Clinton also benefited from a very skillful management of the US economy. In 1999, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969. By 1998 it was a $70 billion budget surplus. While Clinton, Congress and the private sector have all been given credit at different times, this economic success was a source of immense political strength for Clinton. He remained popular through and beyond the end of his terms in office.

===The economy===
During Clinton's tenure, the U.S. enjoyed continuous economic expansion, reductions in unemployment, and growing wealth through a massive rise in the [[stock market]]. The economic boom ended in the first quarter of 2000, approximately 10 months before his term ended in January 2001, possibly indicative of a [[stock market bubble]]. Although the reasons for the expansion are continually debated, Clinton proudly pointed to a number of economic accomplishments, including:
*More than 22 million new jobs created
*Homeownership rate increase from 64.0% to 67.5%
*Lowest unemployment rate in 30 years
*Higher incomes at all levels
*Largest budget deficit in American history converted to the largest surplus of over $200 billion
*Lowest government spending as a percentage of GDP since 1974 <ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy00/guide04.html Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget: Fiscal Year 2000] - [[United States]] [[Government Printing Office]] ([[GPO]])</ref>
*Higher stock ownership by families than ever before
*220% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 300% increase in the Nasdaq from 1993 to 2001

The reasons for this growth are hotly debated, but Clinton supporters cite his [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|1993 tax increase]] as the reason that eventually led to the reduction in the annual budget deficits every year of his tenure. These deficit reductions stimulated consumption and consumer spending and strengthened the dollar, which encouraged foreign investment in the United States economy. [[Alan Greenspan]] supported the 1993 tax increase, which was approved by Congress without a single Republican vote. <ref>[http://www.dickinson.edu/~rudaleva/greenspan.htm Behind the Boom] - Bob Woodward, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[November 12]], [[2000]] </ref> Critics of Clinton point to [[Alan Greenspan]]'s strong chairmanship of the Federal Reserve, 1995 spending cuts and the Republican Party's [[Contract with America]] initiatives as alternative reasons for America's strong economic growth of the late 90's. Critics also argue that the economic recovery had already begun before Bill Clinton took office and did not pick up momentum until 1995 and 1996, after the GOP took over Congress (despite the fact that GDP growth was higher in 1994 than in either 1995 or 1996). Many economists attribute massive growth to the dot-com boom which just happened to come during Clinton's term, thus adding many new jobs which may not be directly attributed to policies of the Clinton administration.

===Trade===
Clinton strongly supported the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement]]. Initiated during the tenure of his predecessor, [[George H.W. Bush]], it was passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 1993, after Clinton and Gore lobbied heavily for it.

The Clinton administration used the [[WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] thirteen times
and prevailed in the WTO thirteen times.<ref>[http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2005/07/20050725_b_main.asp Policing Intellectual Property Across Borders] - audio 12:40-16:30, [[WBUR]] [[Boston]], [[NPR]] news, aired [[July 25]], [[2005]]</ref>

[[Image:Clinton Yeltsin sax.jpg|thumb|right|Clinton plays the saxophone presented to him by Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] at a private dinner in Russia, January 13, 1994]]

Clinton deployed the U.S. military hesitantly several times under hostile circumstances. In 1993, U.S. troops, initially deployed to [[Somalia]] by the Bush administration, fought the [[Battle of Mogadishu]] which attempted to capture local warlord [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]. The Clinton administration withdrew U.S. troops after suffering 19 deaths and 73 wounded at the hands of Somalia militiaman. These militia were later proved to have been trained by the Al Qaida terrorist network. In 1994, Clinton sent U.S. troops into [[Haiti]] to restore [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] as president, ending a period of intense violence. Aristide, who had been elected, had been ousted in a coup just seven months into his term in 1991. Clinton also committed troops twice in the former-[[Yugoslavia]] to stop ethnic violence, most notably in [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]]. In addition, Clinton launched military strikes on Iraq several times to punish violations of [[UN]] sanctions and an attempt to have former President George H. W. Bush assassinated. Clinton did not intervene militarily to end the [[Rwandan genocide]], a decision he later regarded as a "personal failure".

In 1994, Clinton negotiated and signed the Nuclear Accords with [[North Korea]]. The underlying concern was that North Korea was developing [[nuclear weapon]]s technology under the guise of a nuclear power plant. In exchange for assistance with energy needs, North Korea agreed to abandon all ambitions for acquiring nuclear weapons. However, by the mid 1990s defectors from North Korea, along with reports from the [[IAEA]], indicated that North Korea was violating both the Nuclear Accords and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In December 2002, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors from its Yongbyon nuclear facility, and announced (privately in 2003 and publicly in 2005), that they possessed nuclear weapons.

In November, 1995, Clinton committed troops to the Balkans saying the mission would be “precisely defined with clear realistic goals” that could be achieved in a “definite period of time". Clinton assured Americans the mission would take about one year. In October 1996, shortly before Clinton's reelection, the Clinton Administration denied any change in the plans to withdraw troops in December, 1996. However, shortly after reelection, Clinton announced troops would stay longer. Troops ultimately stayed in Bosnia for nine years. <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176728,00.html Should Congress Investigate Misleading Prewar Intelligence?] - Timothy Lynch, [[FOX]], [[November 25]], [[2005]]</ref>

On [[February 17]] [[1998]], Clinton gave a speech signaling the danger of rogue nations providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations with global reach. Clinton specifically pointed to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/17/transcripts/clinton.iraq/ Text Of Clinton Statement On Iraq] - transcript of Clinton speech on [[February 18]], [[1998]], retrieved from [[CNN]], [[February 25]], [[2006]]</ref> In August 1998 UN weapons inspectors left Iraq, leading to [[Operation Desert Fox]] in December.

During Clinton's tenure, [[Al-Qaeda]] began to emerge as a major terrorist threat. In 1993, Al Qaeda [[World Trade Center Bombing|bombed the World Trade Center]].  In 1998, the group [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|bombed]] the American embassies in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. In retaliation, Clinton ordered [[Operation Infinite Reach]], which involved [[cruise missile]] strikes on terrorist camps in [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]] and a suspected chemical weapons facility in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]] that was believed to be tied to bin Laden. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/20/us.strikes.01/ U.S. missiles pound targets in Afghanistan, Sudan] - [[CNN]], [[August 20]], [[1998]]</ref> Clinton also gave orders authorizing the arrest or, if need be, assassination of Al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]]. At the end of his term, in late 2000, the terrorists struck again with the [[USS Cole bombing]]. In 2004, Clinton said he regarded Al-Qaeda as the foremost threat to national security. <ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/20/politics/20PANE.html?hp=&pagewanted=print&position= Clinton Aides Plan to Tell Panel of Warning Bush Team on Qaeda] - Phlip Shenon, ''[[New York Times]]'', [[March 20]], [[2004]] ([http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0320-07.htm Alternative copy], no registration required) </ref> In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the independent investigating commission was critical of Clinton for focusing more on diplomatic than military means to eliminate the bin Laden threat. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18972-2004Mar23.html 9/11 Panel Critical of Clinton, Bush] - Dan Eggen and John Mintz, ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[March 24]], [[2004]]</ref>

After his presidency, Clinton identified his proudest foreign policy accomplishments as mediating peace talks between Israel and the PLO, resulting in the [[Oslo Accords]] (1993). Subsequent events, including the collapse of the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] and the commencement of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], resulted in the Oslo Accords being widely discredited within Israel and in various Palestinian factions by 2004.

Clinton identified his major foreign policy failure as lack of response to the 1994 [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]]. Along with the United Nations, the Clinton administration initially did not publicly acknowledge that genocide was occurring.  This delayed the mandatory response to the crisis and nearly one million people died.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/04/06/rwanda.amanpour/ Amanpour: Looking back at Rwanda genocide] - Christiane Amanpour, [[CNN]], [[April 6]],[[2004]</ref>A report from the Organization for African Unity singled out the United Nations, Belgium, France and United States for condemnation. <ref>[http://www.alternet.org/story/9494/  Clinton Allowed Genocide, New Report Says] - David Corn, [[AlterNet]], [[July 25]], [[2000]]</ref> In 1998, Clinton went to Africa where he said he "did not fully appreciate the depth and speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror."<ref name=RwandaLying>[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=1353 Lying About Rwanda's Genocide] - David Corn, [[The Nation]], [[April 2]], [[2004]]</ref>.

===Impeachment and controversies===
{{main|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}


In 1998, as a result of allegations that he had lied during grand jury testimony regarding his relationship with a young female White House intern ([[Monica Lewinsky]]), Clinton was the second U.S. president to be [[impeached]] by the House of Representatives. The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the [[1998]] mid-term elections: Republican candidates rarely mentioned the issue of impeachment, but Democrats generally came out strongly against impeachment.  In spite of the serious allegations against the President, his party picked up seats in the Congress.  The Republican leadership called a [[lame duck]] session in December 1998 to hastily hold impeachment proceedings: if they had waited until the newly-elected Congress convened in January 1999, the Republicans would not have had enough votes.  

Although the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings were perfunctory and ended in a straight party line vote, the debate on the Floor of the House was lively.  
The two charges which were narrowly passed by the House were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]].  The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to [[Monica Lewinsky]] during a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former Arkansas-state employee [[Paula Jones]]. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony.  Two other charges were voted down.

The presumptive incoming [[Speaker of the House]], [[Bob Livingston]] lost his job as an indirect result of the impeachment process, after he was forced to admit to marital infidelity of his own.

The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress.  The Constitutionality of this was widely questioned, although the most recent set of impeachment proceedings, against Judge [[Walter Nixon]] in 1988 and 1989, also spanned two Congresses.


On [[February 12]], the Senate concluded a 21-day trial with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with all of the votes to convict being cast by Republicans. On the perjury charge 55 senators voted to acquit, including 10 Republicans, and 45 voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50-50. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/impeachment/ Clinton acquitted; president apologizes again] - [[CNN]], [[February 12]], [[1999]]</ref> Clinton, like the only other president to be impeached, [[Andrew Johnson]], served the remainder of his term.

The day before leaving office, Clinton agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas law license as part of an agreement with the independent counsel to end the investigation. Based on this suspension, Clinton was also automatically suspended from the United States Supreme Court bar, from which he chose to resign. [17][18] Clinton's resignation was mostly symbolic, as he had never practiced before the Supreme Court and was not expected to in the future. Clinton also was assessed a $90,000 fine by federal judge Susan Webber Wright for contempt of court. The Paula Jones lawsuit was settled out of court for $850,000.

In addition to impeachment and the [[Whitewater scandal]], the Clinton White House was the subject of many other controversies.

==== 1996 campaign fund-raising controversy ====
{{Main article|1996 U.S. campaign finance scandal}}

[[Image:Clinton-riady-huang.jpg|left|thumb|President Clinton with John Huang (center) and James Riady (right) in the Oval Office]]In late September 1996, questions arose regarding President Clinton and the Democratic Party's fund-raising practices. In February of the following year, the [[People's Republic of China]]'s alleged role in the controversy first gained public attention after the ''[[Washington Post]]'' published a story stating that a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] investigation had discovered evidence that agents of China sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the DNC before the 1996 presidential campaign. The paper wrote that intelligence information had showed the Chinese Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC<ref name=embassy>Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/china1.htm "Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed"], ''Washington Post'', [[February 13|Feb. 13]], [[1997]]
</ref> in violation of U.S. law forbidding non-American citizens from giving monetary donations to U.S. politicians and political parties. Seventeen people, including DNC and Clinton defense fund-raisers [[John Huang]], [[Charlie Trie]], [[James Riady]], and [[Johnny Chung]], were eventually convicted for fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the U.S. elections.

In 2002, the [[Federal Election Commission]] fined the Democratic National Committee $115,000 for its part in illegal fund-raising during the 1996 U.S. election campaigns. The FEC's [[general counsel]] recommended more severe penalties, but the three Democratic election commissioners on the committee blocked the recommendation on a 3-3 tie vote.<ref name=fecfines>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/23/elec02.fec.dnc/ "DNC fined for illegal 1996 fund raising"], ''CNN.com'', [[September 23|Sept. 23]], [[2002]]</ref>

==== Other controversies ====
The [[White House travel office controversy]] involved allegations of impropriety in the firing of civil service staffers. The [[White House personnel file controversy]] involved improper access by security officials to FBI files on White House personnel, without first asking for the individuals' permission. The [[Bill Clinton pardons controversy]] involved a grant of clemency to [[FALN]] bombers in 1999 and pardons to his brother [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger]], tax-evading billionaire [[Marc Rich]] and others in 2001 (see [[List of people pardoned by Bill Clinton]]).

Early in his first-term, a largely discredited documentary, the [[Clinton Chronicles]], implicated Bill Clinton in a large number of deaths of his acquaintences.  This also became known as the "Clinton Body Count" and was the subject of a request for Congressional hearings in 1994.  As many as 60 people were on this list of "suspicious deaths" including [[Jim McDougal]], [[Vince Foster]] and [[Ron Brown]].

In March, 1998 [[Kathleen Willey]], a White House aide, alleged that Clinton had sexually assaulted her. However, Clinton critic [[Linda Tripp]] held that Willey's allegations were false. Tripp told both Independent Counsel [[Ken Starr]] and reporter [[Michael Isikoff]] that she had seen Willey after Willey left Clinton's office that day, and that Willey was joyful from the encounter. She also testified that she helped Willey plot to seduce Clinton.  In the end, the [[Robert Ray]] report deemed Willey an "unreliable witness" because of, "the differences between her deposition and Grand Jury statements, as well as her acknowledgement of false statements to the office of the Independent Counsel <ref>Sidney Blumenthal The Clinton Wars. (2003). ISBN 0-37-412502-3</ref>. Also in 1998, [[Juanita Broaddrick]] alleged that Clinton had raped her in 1978; however, when subpoenaed by attorneys for [[Paula Jones]], she responded with an affadavit that stated, "I do not know have any information to offer regarding an non-consensual or unwelcome sexual advance made by Mr. Clinton<ref>Sidney Blumenthal The Clinton Wars. (2003). ISBN 0-37-412502-3</ref>. She later offered up an affadavit that stated that Clinton had raped her, but her previous under oath statements undermined her claims. In addition, contemporaneous news paper stories documented that Clinton was not at the location at the time that she claimed he was. "[[Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Mike Espy]] was acquitted on each of 30 charges of illegally accepting gifts such as sports tickets, lodging, and transportation from companies regulated by his department in exchange for favors. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/counsels/stories/espy120498.htm A Harsh Verdict for Espy's Prosecutor] - Bill Miller, ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[December 5]], [[1998]]</ref> [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Secretary [[Henry Cisneros]] was indicted on 18 counts of conspiracy, giving false statements and obstruction of Justice. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of lying to the [[FBI]] about the amount of money he gave his mistress, political fundraiser [[Linda Medlar]]. Medlar plead guilty to 28 counts related to the investigation. Both Medlar and Cisneros were pardoned by Clinton. 

On Clinton's last day in office, he pardoned over 200 convicted felons, including his brother Roger who had completed a prison sentence on drug charges and [[Dan Rostenkowski]], the former Chairman of [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] who had been convicted on corruption and mail fraud charges. Another one of those pardoned was [[Marc Rich]], a financier who had fled the United States decades before for tax evasion and other illegal activities including buying illegal oil from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Though his company put up a $200 million dollar bond on behalf of Rich and his partner, Rich fled the country before being indicted and never saw a day of trial or incarcaration. Many questioned the pardon because Denise Rich was a generous donor to the Clinton campaigns and to his library. These actions quickly led to public hearings by congress, headed by Congressman [[Dan Burton]] into the legality of all of Clinton's presidential pardons. Federal prosecutor [[Mary Jo White]] was appointed to investigate as well. The investigation revealed that Denise Rich's last donation to the Clinton library came a full year before Marc Rich's attorney's even discussed asking her to lobby Clinton on his behalf. Burton, as part of his investigation, listened to taped recordings of  Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] pleading with Clinton to pardon Rich as well - Rich had provided millions of dollars in financing for Palestinian development projects and the Israelis considered Rich a significant part of the peace process<ref>Sidney Blumenthal The Clinton Wars. (2003). ISBN 0-37-412502-3</ref>..  Marc Rich was required to pay a $100 million dollar fine as part of the pardon and to waive all statute of limitations in regards to any future civil charges. [[James Comey]] later replaced Mary Jo White, and he closed the investigation without filing any indictments. 

Clinton was criticized by those on the left for his practice of "co-opting" Republican policies, and "triangulating" himself. The triangulation practice would make the public see Clinton on "top" of a triangle, putting himself "above" the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  The theory was that Clinton was, in his eyes, "doing the business of the American people", and not getting involved in partisan politics.  He always stressed he was being bipartisan, but in the end many progressives concluded that he was simply a Republican-lite. Conservative policies that he supported and passed while he was president were [[NAFTA]], [[GATT]], [[welfare reform]], more crimes eligible for the death penalty, the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], and deregulating the telecommunications industry. He dropped a nominee, [[Lani Guinier]], from a key civil rights post because of her Black Power ideological views.  Progressives like [[Ralph Nader]] and union leaders  complained that Clinton's enthusiastic support of free trade cost the Democrats the Congress in 1994. They argued he alienated working class voters and the party's traditional liberal base, and these voters figured that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats cared very much for them.

==Public approval==
While Clinton's job approval rating varied over the course of his first term, ranging from a low of 36 percent in 1993 to a high of 64 percent in 1993 and 1994 <ref>[http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton Job Performance Ratings for President Clinton], accessed [[February 25]], [[2006]]</ref>, his job approval rating consistently ranged from the high 50s to the high 60s in his second term <ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/clinton-.htm Bill Clinton: Job Ratings] - PollingReport.com</ref>, with a high of 73 percent approval in 1998 and 1999. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/clinton_under_fire/latest_news/newsid_238000/238677.stm US public wants censure not trial] - [[BBC]], [[December 21]], [[1998]]</ref> A CNN/USA TODAY/Gallup poll <ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/10/cnn.poll.clinton/ Poll: Majority of Americans glad Clinton is leaving office] - Keating Holland, [[CNN]], [[January 10]], [[2001]]</ref> conducted as he was leaving office, revealed deeply contradictory attitudes regarding Clinton. Although his approval rating at 68 percent was higher than that of any other departing president since polling began more than seven decades earlier, only 45 percent said they would miss him. While 55 percent thought he "would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life", and 47 percent rated him as either outstanding or above average as a president, 68 percent thought he would be remembered for his "involvement in personal scandal" rather than his accomplishments as president, and 58 percent answered "No" to the question "Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?" 47 percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.

[[Image:ClintonChild.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Clinton sitting with a child.]]

As the first [[Baby Boomer]] president, Clinton was the first president in a half century not shaped by World War II.  With his sound-bite-ready dialogue and pioneering use of pop culture in his campaigning (he appeared on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' playing his saxophone during the 1992 campaign), Clinton was described, often negatively, as the "[[MTV]] president".  Until his inauguration as president, he had earned substantially less money than his wife, and had the smallest net worth of any president in modern history, according to ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton's Autobiography)|My Life]]'', Clinton's autobiography. Clinton was popular among [[African-American]]s and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency. <ref>[http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=122950 A Conversation With President Bill Clinton on Race in America Today] - interview with Clinton, [[Center for American Progress]], [[July 16]], [[2004]]</ref>

The couple was a political partnership unknown since Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Many jokes implied that Hillary was the real [[President of the United States]].

Social conservatives were put off by the impression of Clinton having been a "[[hippie]]" during the late 1960s, his coming-of-age era {{fact}}. In the 1960s, however, Clinton might not have been viewed as such by many of those in the hippie subculture  {{fact}}. Clinton avoided the draft with a student deferment while studying abroad during the [[Vietnam War]]. Clinton's marijuana experimentation, excused by Clinton's statement that he "didn't inhale", further tarnished his image with some voters. In terms of policy Clinton was to the right of most recent Democratic candidates for the presidency on many issues {{fact}} - he supported the [[death penalty]], [[curfew]]s, uniforms in public schools, and other measures opposed by [[youth rights]] supporters, and he expanded the [[War on Drugs]] greatly while in office {{fact}}.

===Extramarital Affairs===
Starting from [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential election campaign]], rumors about Clinton's [[adultery]] were floating about, and these surfaced and increased with [[Paula Jones]]' accusations of [[sexual harassment]]. After allegations had linked him to Jones, [[Gennifer Flowers]], and [[Kathleen Willey]], Clinton's sex life would become the focus of his public image when, in January 1998, recorded conversations by [[Linda Tripp]] contained statements by White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]] about having [[oral sex]].

Clinton is often referred to by nickname among both detractors and fans. One of the earliest was "Bubba", which alludes to his Southern [[Good ol' boy|"good ol' boy"]] background. Other common nicknames include "Slick Willy" and "Clintoon" (by detractors), and the "Big Dog" (by fans). Although the phrase typically refers to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidency, Clinton's presidency is sometimes referred to as the "[[Teflon character|Teflon]] Presidency" for how scandals and setbacks never seem to stick to him, at least in terms of dropped public support. During his first presidential campaign in 1992 he claimed the moniker of the "Comeback Kid" after placing second in the [[New Hampshire primary]] to [[Paul Tsongas]] ("Tonight New Hampshire's made me the Comeback Kid").

==Post-presidential career==

Like other former American presidents, Clinton has engaged in a career as a public speaker on a variety of issues (earning $875,000 in 2004 alone, according to Mr. Clinton's own financial disclosure statements). The speaking engagements are remarkable in that since 2001, when he addressed a large gathering of Morgan Stanley investment 'fat cats' and incited a major backlash aimed at company management, he is conspicuously absent from any major US company invitations. In his speaking outside the country and in public forums, he continues to comment on aspects of contemporary politics.  One notable theme is his advocacy of multilateral solutions to problems facing the world. Clinton's close relationship with the [[African American]] community has been highlighted in his post-Presidential career with his opening of his personal office in the [[Harlem]] section of New York City. He assisted his wife [[Hillary Clinton]] in her campaign for office as Senator from New York.

In February 2004, Clinton (along with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Sophia Loren]]) won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Awards of 2004#Children's|Best Spoken Word Album for Children]] for narrating the [[Russian National Orchestra]]'s album ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]/Wolf Tracks''. Clinton won a second Grammy in February 2005, [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]] for ''[[My Life]]''.

Clinton's autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton's Autobiography)|My Life]]'', was released in June  2004. 

On [[July 26]] [[2004]], Clinton spoke for the fifth time in a row to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], using the opportunity to praise candidate [[John Kerry]]. Many Democrats believed that Clinton's speech was one of the best in Convention history. In it, he criticized President George W. Bush's depiction of Kerry, saying that "strength and wisdom are not opposing values."

On [[September 2]] [[2004]], Clinton had an episode of [[angina]] and was evaluated at [[Northern Westchester Hospital]]. It was determined that he had not suffered a [[coronary infarction]], and he was sent home, returning the following day for [[angiography]], which disclosed multiple vessel [[coronary artery disease]]. He was transferred to [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City, where he successfully underwent quadruple [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] on [[September 6]] [[2004]]. The medical team responsible for Clinton claimed that, had he not had surgery, he would likely have suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] within a few months. On [[March 10]] [[2005]], he underwent a follow-up surgery to remove scar tissue and fluid from his left chest cavity, a result of his open-heart surgery.

He dedicated his [[presidential library]], which is the largest in the nation, the [[William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park|William J. Clinton Presidential Center]], in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] on [[November 18]] [[2004]]. Under rainy skies, Clinton received words of praise from former presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], as well as from the current president, [[George W. Bush]]. He was also treated to a musical rendition from [[Bono]] and [[David Howell Evans|The Edge]] from [[U2]], who expressed their gratitude at Clinton's efforts to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict during his presidency.

[[Image:Jp2presidents.jpg|thumb|right|Clinton, along with Pres. George W. Bush, Laura Bush, and Pres. George H. W. Bush pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.]]

On [[November 22]] [[2004]], New York Republican Governor [[George Pataki]] named Clinton and the other living former presidents ([[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[George H. W. Bush]]) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the [[World Trade Center]].

On [[December 8]] [[2004]], Clinton announced that he was the new spokesperson for [[Accoona]], an [[internet]] [[search engine]] company.

===Friendship with George H.W. Bush===

There had been reported signs of a friendship growing between Clinton and George H.W. Bush. After the official unveiling of his White House portrait in June 2004, the Asian Tsunami disaster, Hurricane Katrina, and the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], Clinton and Bush met on occasion, although the nature of the friendship did not appear to be a reconciliation of political opinions.

[[Image:Bush and Clinton.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton with former President George H.W. Bush in January 2005.]]
On [[January 3]] [[2005]], President George W. Bush named Clinton and George H. W. Bush to lead a nationwide campaign to help the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. On [[February 1]] [[2005]], he was picked by UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] to head the [[United Nations]] [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|earthquake and tsunami relief and reconstruction effort]]. Five days later, he and Bush both appeared on the [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] pre-game show on [[Fox Television Network|Fox]] in support of their bipartisan effort to raise money for relief of the disaster through the [[USA Freedom Corps]], an action which Bush described as "transcending politics." Thirteen days later, they both traveled to the affected areas to see how the relief efforts were going.

On [[August 31]] 2005, following the devastation of the [[Gulf Coast]] by [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clinton again teamed with George H. W. Bush to coordinate private relief donations, in a campaign similar to their earlier one in response to the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Clinton was highly critical of the federal government response to the hurricane, saying that the government "failed" the people affected, and that an investigation into the response was warranted. <ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/05/clinton.katrina/index.html Clinton: Government 'failed' people] - [[CNN]], [[September 5]], [[2005]]</ref>

Following the [[death of Pope John Paul II]] on [[April 2]] [[2005]] Clinton stirred up a mini-controversy saying the late pontiff, "may have had a mixed legacy…there will be debates about him. But on balance, he was a man of God, he was a consistent person, he did what he thought was right." Clinton sat with both President George W. Bush and former President George H.W. Bush as the first current or former American heads of state to attend a papal funeral.

On [[September 16]] 2005, Clinton appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to talk about Senator Clinton's political career.

On [[December 9]] 2005, speaking at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Montreal]], Clinton publicly criticized the Bush Administration about its handling of emissions control.

On [[February 7]], [[2006]], Clinton appeared at [[Coretta Scott King]]'s funeral.

Whilst in [[Sydney]] to attend a Global Business Forum, Clinton signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of his presidential foundation with the Australian government to boost HIV/AIDS programs in the Asia-Pacific region.

On March 5, 2006, he received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[Pace University]], and is the first recipient of the Pace University President's Centennial Award. Following reception of the honorary degree, he spoke to the students, faculty, alumni and staff of Pace, officially kicking off the centennial anniversary of the university. Also in 2006 Clinton was awarded the [[J. William Fulbright]] Prize for International Understanding.
