'''''The Disco Before The Breakdown''''' is an [[Extended play|EP]] released by the [[folk punk]] [[band (music)|band]] [[Against Me!]]. The title track is a marked departure from their earlier sound only in that it incorporates friends and musicians from their label, [[No Idea Records]], as a horns section. The second track, "Tonight We're Gonna Give it 35%", shows perhaps the band's greatest transition away from their [[acoustic punk]] sound towards a more traditional [[rock (music)|rock]].
