The '''[[Password]] Project''' is an [[internet]] project aimed at agreeing guidelines for the type of rules that [[computer]] systems should impose when people create passwords. People use passwords for [[secure]] [[websites]], such as [[online banking]], [[webmail]], and [[web hosting]] platforms. To encourage secure passwords many of these systems will not permit passwords if they do not conform to rules integrated in the system, such as requiring a minimum of one or more [[upper case]] characters, [[numbers]] or special characters.

However because different systems impose a different set of rules, people who use many systems can end up having many different passwords, and this is made difficult by systems which force people to change their passwords at regular intervals. The creators of the Password Project believe that such onerous rules can damage, rather than improve, security because people who cannot to remember a wide variety of ever-changing passwords may resort to writing them down, often in very insecure places.

The Password Project website is accepting submissions on what would be best practice in a variety of areas, with the intention of achieving [[consensus]], and publishing a draft set of guidelines. Following a period for comments and revision, the draft guidelines are hoped to become the accepted standard.
