In [[theology]], '''monotheism''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μόνος'' = single and ''θεός'' = [[God]]) is the belief in the existence of one [[deity]] or God, or in the oneness of God. In Western context, the concept of  "monotheism" tends to be dominated by the concept of the God of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s and the [[Neoplatonism|Platonic]] concept of God as put forward by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].

The concept of monotheism has largely been defined in contrast with earlier [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, and monotheism tends to overlap with other [[Unitary]] concepts, such as [[monism]].

Ostensibly monotheistic religions may still include concepts of a plurality of the divine, for example the Christian [[Trinity]], or the veneration of [[Saint]]s, as well as the belief in "lesser spirits" such as [[angel]]s or [[demon]]s.

Historically, monotheism emerges in the [[Late Bronze Age]] in a gradual process comprising [[henotheism|henotheistic]] and [[panentheism|panentheistic]] notions. 

==Ancient religions==
Ancient [[Middle-East]]ern religions may have worshipped a single god within a pantheon and the abolition of all others, as in the case of the [[Aten]] cult in the reign of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]], under the chiefly influence of the Eastern-originating [[Nefertiti]]. [[Iconoclasm]] during this pharaoh's rule is considered a chief origin for the subsequent destruction by some groups of idols, holding that no other God before the preferred deity (dually and subtly acknowledging the existence of the other gods, but only as foes to be destroyed for their drawing of attention away from the primary deity). [[Hinduism]] was also a pre-biblical monotheisic faith, worshipping one divine force known as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], or the Brahman. 

Other issues like the [[Divine Right of Kings]] may possibly also stems from pharaonic laws on the ruler being the [[demigod]] or representative of the [[Creator]] on Earth. The massive [[tomb]]s in the [[Egyptian pyramids]] which aligned with [[astronomical observation]]s, exemplify this relationship between the pharaoh and the heavens and was subsequently adopted by Christian [[royal family|royalty]] by claiming a direct lease on ruling by the grace of God.

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] is considered to be one of the earliest monotheistic beliefs, though some derivatives of it are not fully so, as the chief god in derivatives such as [[Zurvanism]] is not the sole creator. Zoroastrian monotheism has had major influence on the religions of the middle eastern monotheisms in adaptations of such concepts as heavens, hells, judgement day and messianic figures.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Source of Abrahamic religions===
Although the major source of both [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] is the [[Hebrew Bible]], Judaism and Christianity may have received influences from various non-biblical religions present in [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. This can be seen by the [[Torah]]'s reference to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] culture in Genesis and the story of Moses, as well as the mention of [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] cultures of Syria in the Genesis story of Abraham. The Hebrews are a group of the Canaanite peoples who prior to the development of monotheism practised a [[polytheistic]] religion.

In traditional [[Jewish]], [[Christian]], and [[Islamic]] thought, monotheism was regarded as their most basic belief. They have traditionally interpreted scriptures as [[exclusive monotheism]].

===Jewish view===
{{Main|Judaism}}
Judaism is one of the oldest known monotheistic faiths. The best-known Jewish statements of monotheism occur in the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] prayer, the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides.27 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of faith]], Second Principle:

"[God], the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity. This is referred to in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4): "Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one."  
{{section-stub}}


There has historically been disagreement between the understanding of monotheism among [[Hasidic Jews]] and the original perspective of the [[Mitnagdim]] Jews on this issue.  A similar situation of opposing views on monotheism is seen in modern times among [[Dor Daim]], students of the [[Rambam]], segments of [[Lithuanian]] Jewry, and portions of the [[Modern Orthodox]] world toward Jewish communities that are more thoroughly influenced by [[Luria]]nic [[Kabbalistic]] teachings such as [[Hasidism]] and large segments of the [[Sepharadi]] and [[Mizrahi]] communities.  This dispute is likely rooted in the differences between what are popularly referred to as the "philosophically inclinded" sources and the "[[kabbalist]]ic sources;"  the "philosophic sources" include such Rabbis as [[Saadia Gaon]], Rabenu [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and [[Maimonides]].  The "kabbalistic sources" include Rabbis such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Bahya ben Asher]], Rabbi [[Yitzhak Saggi Nehor]], and [[Azriel]].  The [[Vilna Gaon]] is usually granted great respect in modern times by those who side with both views; by the more kabbalistic segments of Judaism he is regarded as a great kabbalist; those who take the other side of the issue regard him as a strict advocate of the people of [[Israel]]'s historical monotheism.

===Christian view===
{{Main|Christianity}}

[[Christianity|Christians]] claim to profess belief in one God.  Historically, most Christian churches have taught that the nature of God is something of a mystery: while being a unity, God also manifests as three entities: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]] (collectively called the [[Trinity]]), the classic Christian "three becomes one" formula. Typically, Christian orthodoxy holds that these three entities are not independent but are ''homoousios'' (a Hellenistic Greek transliteration), meaning sharing the same essence or substance of divinity. The true nature of the Trinity is held to be an inexplicable mystery, deduced from [[New Testament]] but developmentally is the result of theological debate in the [[Council of Nicea]] in 325, codified in 381, and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. 

However, some critics consider that Christianity is a form of [[Tritheism]], while this might be true in some instances, Christianity is properly understood as [[Tripartite monotheism]]. <ref name=MuslimCritic>For Muslim critiques, see [http://www.answering-christianity.com/allah_responds.htm Allah Almighty's Response to pagan and trinitarian polytheism]; Miller, Dr. Gary, [http://thetruereligion.org/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=122 A concise reply to Christianity].</ref> For [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]], the idea of God as a [[trinity]] is [[heretical]] - it is considered akin to [[polytheism]]. 

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith; "I believe in one God" is a key statement in the most widely used Christian creeds. Moreover, some Christian sects, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Oneness Pentecostal]]s, deny the idea of Trinity altogether, while many individual Christians formulate their own opinions on the matter which may or may not follow the doctrine of their tradition. Other small Christian groups have their own unique viewpoint. For example, the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]], like many Christians, hold that God is both a unity and a trinity, in their case God being [[Haile Selassie]]. 
Some Christian denominations, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] practice Veneration of [[Saint]]s, which critics claim is a form of [[polytheism]]. However, Roman Catholic teaching regards veneration of saints and prayers to saints as no different from petitioning a living person to pray to God on behalf of the petitioner.

===Islamic view===
{{main|Tawhīd|Hanif}}

[[Islam]] means "submission to God". In Islam monotheism is unambigiously absolute, not relative or pluralistic in any sense of the word, as emphasized for example in surah [[Al-Ikhlas]]. Islam accepts as its fundamental tenet the oneness and uniqueness of God, the Arabic word for monotheism is '''[[Tawhid|Tawhīd]]''' which means 'being one', i.e. alone, only one in number. 

The [[Shahadah]] (الشهادة) (meaning testimony, declaration), or the Islamic creed, is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God ([[Allah]] in Arabic) and the prophethood of [[Muhammad]]. It goes as follows (Transliteration): "Ash-hadu an la-ilaha illa Allah, Wa Ashhadu Anna Muhammad Rasoolu Allah", Its translation: I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship (in truth) but God, and I testify that [[Muhammad]] is [[God]]'s messenger.  Its declaration and belief is considered the first of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] by [[Muslim]]s. To become a [[Muslim]] one just has to sincerely believe in the above statement inwardly and outwardly state  this [[shahadah]] aloud in front of witnesses. The [[salaat]] (five daily prayers) in Islam, for example, involve explicit Abrahamic monotheistic testimony.
 
According to Islam the "oneness of God" is the primary teaching of all prophets and messengers of God (including Jesus and Moses) sent to humanity for guidance. Furthermore, Islam considers Christianity's Trinity [[polytheism]] and a distortion of [[Jesus]]'s original message of oneness of God.

===Bahá'í view===
{{main|Bahá'í concept of God}}
The Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Bahá'ís believe that there is one supernatural being, God, who has created all the creatures and forces in the universe.  God is described as "a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty." [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-9.html#gr26]  Bahá'ís believe that although people have different concepts of God and His nature, and call Him by different names, everyone is speaking of the same one Being. God is taught to be a [[personal God]] in that God is conscious of His creation, has a mind, will and purpose.  At the same time the Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully understand Him or to create a complete and accurate image of Him.  [[Bahá'u'lláh]] attributed titles to God such as the All-Powerful, and the All-Loving, which are derived from the limited human experiences of power, love, or justice. Bahá'u'lláh teaches that human knowledge of God is limited to those attributes and qualities which are perceptible to us, and thus direct knowledge about the essence of God is not possible. Bahá'ís believe, thus, that through daily prayer, meditation and study they can grow closer to God.  The [[Obligatory Bahá'í Prayers|obligatory prayer]]s in the Bahá'í Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony. 

Furthermore Bahá'u'lláh states that the knowledge of the attributes of God is revealed to humanity through the [[Manifestation of God|messengers]] he sends to humanity.  The Bahá'í Faith accepts the authenticity of the founders of monotheistic faiths such as [[Abraham]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], et cetera.  Given Bahá'í beliefs in the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]] and that [[progressive revelation|revelation is progressive]], some non-Abrahamanic religions are accepted and seen as providing an earlier or partial understanding of the unity of God.  This is not only true of seemingly [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] traditions such as popular [[Hinduism]], which follows [[Smarta]] tradition, for the most part but even of what are sometimes interpreted as [[Atheism|atheistic]] teachings, such as [[Buddhism]].

==Dharmic religions==
{{main|Dharmic religions}}
===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism}}
The [[Vedas]] are the most sacred texts ([[śruti (scripture)|śruti]]) in Hinduism. The oldest of them, the [[Rigveda]], at more than 3000 years old, in its youngest books (books 1 and 10) contains evidence for emerging monotheistic thought. Often quoted are [[pada]] 1.164.46c,
<!--:{{lang|sa|एकं सद विप्रा बहुधा वदन्त्य}} fix final -ya to -i, or else quote the following pada-->
:''{{IAST|ékam sád víprā́ bahudhā́ vadanti}}'' 
:"To what is One, sages give many a title" (trans. [[Ralph T.H. Griffith|Griffith]]) 
and hymns 10.129 and 10.130, dealing with a creator deity, especially verse 10.129.7:
:''{{IAST| iyám vísṛṣṭiḥ yátaḥ ābabhûva / yádi vā dadhé yádi vā ná / yáḥ asya ádhyakṣaḥ paramé vyóman / sáḥ aṅgá veda yádi vā ná véda}}''
:"He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, / Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not." (trans. Griffith)

''{{IAST|Ékam sát}}''<!--leave the -t. -d in samhita is just sandhi, this is the pausa form--> 
in 1.164.46c means "One Being" or "One Truth". In [[Hinduism]], views are broad and range from [[polytheism]], [[monism]], [[dualism]], [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars, to strict [[monotheism]], see [[Hindu denominations]].

Contemporary Hinduism is divided into four major divisions, [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smartism]] {{fact}}. The denominations all believe in one God but differ in their conceptions. The two primary form of differences are between the two monotheistic denominations of [[Vaishnavism]] which conceives God as [[Vishnu]] and [[Shaivism]], which conceives God as [[Shiva]]. Other aspects of God are in fact aspects of Vishnu or Shiva. [[Smartas]], who follow [[Advaita]] philosophy, are [[monism|monists]], and view multiple manifestations of the one God or source of being. Hindu monists see one unity, with the personal Gods, different aspects of only One Supreme Being, like a single beam of light separated into colours by a prism, and are valid to worship. Some of the Smarta aspects of God include [[Devi]], [[Vishnu]], [[Ganesh]], and [[Siva]]. It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of Hinduism in the West. By contrast with Smarta/Advaita belief, [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] follows a singular concept of God, or [[panentheistic]] [[monotheism]] or panentheistic [[monism]].

Many Hindus believe that God has six attributes. However, the actual number of auspicious qualities of God, are '''countless''', with the following six qualities being the ''most important.''
* The number six is invariably given, but the individual attributes listed vary. One set of attributes (and their common interpretations) are:
**''Jñāna'' ([[Omniscience]]), defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously;
**''Aishvarya'' ([[Sovereignty]], derived from the word Ishvara), which consists in unchallenged rule over all; 
**''Shakti'' (Energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible;
**''Bala'' (Strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue; 
**''Vīrya'' (Vigor), or valour which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations; and 
**''Tejas'' (Splendor), which expresses his self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by his spiritual effulgence.; (''cited from ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'', by Swami Tapasyānanda.'')

Additionally, many Hindus, including [[Smartas]], believe in God having three aspects as [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], the [[Trimurti]] (also called the Hindu trinity.) and these different aspects are part of the one and the same God.
{{See|Hindu views on monotheism}}

===Sikhism===

{{main|Sikhism}}

[[Sikhism]] is a distinctly monotheistic faith that rose in northern [[India]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Sikh]]s believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], known as the [[Mool Mantra]] signifies this:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[Transliteration]]: Ik ōaṅkār sat nām karatā purakh nirabha'u niravair akāl mūrat ajūnī saibhaṁ gur prasād.
:[[English language|English]]: One Universal Creator God. The Name Is Truth. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace ~ 

The word '''"ੴ"''' is pronounced '''"Ik ōaṅkār"''' and is comprised to two parts. The first part is simply: <big>'''"੧"'''</big> - This is simply the digit '''"1"''' in [[Gurmukhi]] signifying the singularity of the Creator. Together the word means: '''"There is only one Creator God"'''

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] are all expansions on the [[Mool Mantra]]. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, they all refer to the same supreme being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of Space and is the creator of all beings in the whole [[Universe]]. The following quotation from the [[SGGS]] highlights this point:

 <blockquote>"Chant, and meditate on '''the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe'''. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him."[[SGGS]] Page 782</blockquote>

The Sikhs believe that [[Allah]] - The name of God used by [[Muslim]] is a valid name to use. Similarly, the name [[Hari]], [[Raam]], [[Brahman|Paarbrahm]], [[Krishna|Krishan]] which are names of God used by [[Hindu]]s are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. The same God of the [[Christian]]s, [[Muslims]], [[Hindus]], etc is the [[Akal Purakh]], the primal being of the Sikhs.

==The development of monotheism==
===Early monotheism===
The religions that are monotheistic today are often thought of as having been of relatively recent historical origin — although efforts at comparison are usually beset by claims of most religions to being very ancient or eternal. Eastern religions, especially in [[China]] and [[India]], that have concepts of [[panentheism]], are notably difficult to classify along [[Western world|Western]] notions of monotheism vs. [[polytheism]]. Attempting to compare the two is much like asking how many sides a circle has when comparing to a square, in that it makes no sense.

The earliest example of emerging monotheism is the cult of [[Aten]] introduced by [[Akhenaten]] in ca. 1340 BC. [[RV 10|Book 10]] of the [[Rigveda]] (ca. 1200 BC) has two hymns to a [[panentheistic]]  creator God (10.129,130). Other early examples include [[Zoroastrian]] [[Ahuramazda]] and Chinese [[Shang Ti]]. [[Abraham]] is notably considered the discoverer of monotheism in Judeo-Christian and Islamic tradition (see [[Hanif]]).

In the [[Ancient Orient]], many cities had their own local god, though this henotheistic worship of a single god did not imply denial of the existence of other gods. The [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[Ark of the Covenant]] is supposed (by some scholars) to have adapted this practice to a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, paving their way for a singular God. Yet, many scholars now believe that it may have been the Zoroastrian religion of the [[Persian Empire]] that was the first monotheistic religion, and the Jews were influenced by such notions (this controversy is still in debate)[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=147&letter=Z&search=zoroaster].

The iconoclastic cult of the Egyptian solar god [[Aten]] was promoted by the [[pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] (Amenophis IV), who ruled between 1358 and 1340 BC. The Aten cult is often cited as the earliest known example of monotheism, and is sometimes claimed to have been a formative influence on early Judaism, due to the presence of Hebrew slaves in Egypt. But even though [[Akhenaten]]'s [[Great Hymn to the Aten|hymn to Aten]] offers strong evidence that Akhenaten considered Aten to be the sole, omnipotent creator, Akhenaten's program to enforce this monotheistic world-view ended with his death; the worship of other gods beside Aten never ceased outside his court, and the older polytheistic cults soon regained precedence.

The worship of polytheistic gods, on the other hand, predates monotheism, likely reaching back as far as the [[Paleolithic]] (although no clear separation of theistic cults from [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] is possible).

===History in Abrahamic religions===
The word "monotheism" is Greek, “''mon''” meaning alone, and “''theos''” meaning God.<ref>‘ Merriam-Webster Dictionary’; http://www.m-w.com/; retrieved 25 March 2006.</ref>  The belief in the existence of one God, or in the oneness of God.<ref>“Monotheism”, in Brittanica, 15th ed. (1986), 8:266.</ref> ''Monotheism'' characterises Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<ref>“Monotheism”, in Brittanica, 15th ed. (1986), 8:266.</ref>  Judaism having the earliest origins of these three shows an interesting development of the concept. In Genesis chapter one, God is put in the singular context. He is unambiguously singular, and therefore Genesis chapter one could be said to be a ''Monotheistic''. (Gen 1:1) However, if we look at God’s interaction with Abraham, the evidence is less compelling. According to the book of Judith, the Patriarchs (starting with Abraham), left the gods of their fathers. (Jdt 5:7) God is later to reveal Himself not as the only God, but rather as the god whom Abraham knows. (Gen 15:17) In such a respect, God is not God alone, but the god who was worshipped by Abraham’s clan. In such a context, it is a type of tribal deity, that although was worshipped alone, did not explicitly exclude the existence of other gods, who were not relevant to them.<ref>R.G.Vincent, “Monotheism (in the Bible)” in New Catholic Encyclopedia, (1967), 9:1066.</ref>

In the early Mosaic era, the possibility of other gods is left an open question, although by this stage Israel claims that their God is greater. (Ex 18:11) This same subtle shift is reverberated in 2 Chr 2:5, and could indicate that Israel understood that the God they recognised was God alone, and other gods were therefore false. This would be ''Monotheism'' in the proper sense of the world. By the time of the prophet Isaiah, ''Monotheism'' is solidly and explicitly accepted. “Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.” (Is 44:6) Thus, the development of the people of Israel to a true ''Monotheism'', appears to be a gradual process, with the exception of Gen 1:1. It is therefore likely that Gen 1:1 was redacted later than the other examples supplied, and so, the development of ''Monotheism'' comes firstly on a tribal level, and gradually advances to recognition that the God of Israel is the only God. It is into this context that Christianity emerges, and thus Christianity was from the outset ''Monotheistic''. (John 1:1)
Likewise, Islam claims Abrahamic origins, and is also instructed there is one God in the Koran: “And your God is one God! There is no god but He; He is the Beneficent, the Merciful.” (Surah 2:163). Thus, Islam is considered foundationally ''Monotheistic''.

====Monotheism, polytheism or monism?====
{|width="100%"
|+'''The Shema'''
|Hebrew ||שמע ישראל יי אלהנו יי אחד
|-
|Common transliteration ||Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad
|-
|English ||Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God! The LORD is One!
|}

The literal word meanings are roughly as follows:
*Shema — 'listen' or 'hear.' The word also implies comprehension.
*Yisrael — 'Israel', in the sense of the people or congregation of Israel 
*Adonai — often translated as 'Lord', it is used in place of the [[Tetragrammaton]]
*Eloheinu — 'our God', a plural noun (said to imply majesty rather than plural number) with a pronominal suffix ('our')
*Echad — 'one'

In this case, ''Elohim'' is used in the plural as a form of respect and not polytheism.

'''Gen.1:26''' And Elohim said, Let '''us''' make man in '''our''' image, after '''our''' likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

[[Elohim]] is morphologically plural in form in Hebrew, but generally takes singular agreement when it refers to the God of Israel (so the verb meaning "said" in this verse is ''vayyomer'' ויאמר with singular inflection, and not ''vayyomru'' ויאמרו with plural inflection), and yet in this case the "our" and "us" seems to create a presumption of plurality, though it may just be God talking to angels and not another god.

Judaism, however, insists that the "LORD is One," as in the Shema, and at least two interpretations exist to explain the Torah's use of the plural form. The first is that the plural form "Elohim" is analogous to the [[royal plural]] as used in English. The second is that, in order to set an example for human kings, Elohim consulted with his court (the angels, just created) before making a major decision (creating man).

====Monotheistic interpretations====
In the west, the [[Hebrew Bible]] has been the [[primary source]] describing how and when Monotheism was introduced into the Middle East and the west. As believed by followers of some of the [[Abrahamic religions]], it teaches that when [[Abraham]] discovered God ([[Genesis]] 12:1-9 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=12] ; 13:14-18 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=13] ; 15 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=15] 18 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=18] ; and 22 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=22]), he thus became the world's first Monotheist. According to these, until then, in [[ancient history]] all cultures believed in a variety of multiple deities such as in [[idolatry]], forces and creatures of [[nature]] as in [[animism]], or in celestial bodies as in [[astrology]], but did not know the one and only true [[Names of God in Judaism|God]].

However, the Hebrew Bible teaches that, at [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]], [[Adam and Eve]] knew God (and so did their descendants) but that over the ages, God and his name were forgotten. This is how one of the most important [[Jew]]ish sages, [[Maimonides]] describes the process in his work the [[Mishneh Torah]]:

:''In the days of [[Generations of Adam|Enosh]] mankind made a huge error...they reasoned that since the Lord created the [[star]]s and the heavenly spheres and placed them in the skies giving them great significance, and they serve before Him, it is therefore fitting to praise and elevate them and give them honor believing this to be the Lord's will to honor that which He makes great and honorable...The people then built [[altar]]s to worship the stars and to praise and bow down to them...and this was the essence of idol worship (''avoda zara'')...After a few generations [[false prophet]]s arose and said that the Lord had actually commanded people to worship the stars...and they built images in their honor...spreading these false images by building them in gathering places, under trees, on tops of hills, and in valleys, gathering people who bowed down to them declaring: 'Such and such an image brings good or bad luck and therefore fear it'...after a number of generations, the Divine Name was completely forgotten...until the mighty one ([[Abraham]]), began to question this in his mind and asked 'How could it be that the heavenly sphere moves without a Mover behind it? because it is impossible that it moves itself', and he had no teacher and no-one to inform him for he lived in [[Ur Kasdim|Ur of the Chaldees]] surrounded by foolish idol worshippers...He (Abraham) subsequently arose and made it known to the people that there is only one Lord in the entire world and that only He should be worshipped, gathering people from city to city and kingdom to kingdom until he came to the land of [[Canaan]] calling out as it says: '[Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in [[Beersheba]], and there he called in the name of God, Lord of the Universe (''El olam''). (Genesis 21:33)' ([[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Sefer Mada'' ("Book of Knowledge"), Chapter 1, ''Hilchos Avodah Zarah'' ("Laws of [forbidden] idol worship"). [http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive.asp?AID=6780 Hebrew text]) 

[[Judaism]] claims to have an important advantage over all other religions because its earliest [[Jewish history|history]], [[Jewish principles of faith|beliefs]], [[613 mitzvot|laws]], and [[Minhag|practices]] are preserved and taught in the [[Torah]] (the [[Hebrew Bible]]) which provides the clearest textual source for the rise and development of what is named Judaism's [[ethical monotheism]] which means that: 

:''(1) There is one God from whom emanates one morality for all humanity. (2) God's primary demand of people is that they act decently toward one another...The God of ethical monotheism is the God first revealed to the world in the Hebrew Bible. Through it, we can establish God's four primary characteristics: 
#God is supernatural. 
#God is personal. 
#God is good. 
#God is holy. 
:''...in the study of Hebrew history: Israel's monotheism was an ethical monotheism.'' [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mono.html Dennis Prager] 

When Moses returned with the [[Ten Commandments]]. The first stated that "you shall have no other gods before me" ([[Exodus]] 20:3). Furthermore, Israelites recite the [[Shema Yisrael]] ("Hear O' Israel") which partly says, "Hear, O' Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." Monotheism was and is the central tenet of the Israelite and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]].

==Other types of monotheism==
{{main|Comparative religion}}
Some argue that there are various forms of monotheism, including:
*[[Theism]] a term that refers to the belief in the existence of a God or divine being.
* [[Deism]] is a form of monotheism in which it is believed that one God exists. However, a deist rejects the idea that this God intervenes in the world. Hence any notion of special [[revelation]] is impossible, and the nature of God can only be known through reason and observation from nature. A deist thus rejects the miraculous, and the claim to knowledge made for religious groups and texts. 
* [[Monistic Theism]] is the type of monotheism found in Hinduism and in the scriptures of the semitic religions. The long time Monistic interpretation of Hindu scriptures is different from the interpretation of Semitic scriptures which claim exclusive monotheism as it encompasses [[pantheism]], [[monism]], and at the same time includes the concept of a personal God as an universal, omnipotent supreme being. The other types of monotheism are qualified monism, the school of [[Ramanuja]] or [[Vishishtadvaita]], which admits that the universe is part of God, or [[Narayana]], a type of [[panentheism]], but there is a plurality of souls within this supreme Being and [[Dvaita]], which differs in that it is dualistic, as God is separate and not panentheistic.
*[[Pantheism]] holds that [[Universe|the Universe]] itself is [[Deity|God]]. The existence of a transcendent supreme extraneous to nature is denied. Depending on how this is understood, such a view may well be presented as tantamount to [[atheism]], [[deism]] or [[panentheism]].
*[[Panentheism]], or Monistic Monotheism, is a form of [[theism]] that holds that God contains, but is not identical to, [[Universe|the Universe]]. The One God is omnipotent and all-pervading, the universe is part of God, and God is ''both'' [[Immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|Transcendent]]. This is also the view of [[Process theology]] and also [[Vishistadvaita]] Vedanta Hinduism. According to this school, from [[Ramanuja]], the universe is part of God but God is not equal to the universe but in fact transcends it as well. However, unlike Process theology, God in Vishistadvaita Vedanta Hinduism is omnipotent. Panentheism is thought of as "God is within the universe as the [[soul]] is within the body". 
*[[Substance monotheism]], found in some indigenous African religions, holds that the many gods are different forms of a single underlying substance, and that this underlying substance is God. This view has vague similarities to the Christian [[Trinity|trinitarian]] view of three persons sharing one nature.
*[[Henotheism]] involves devotion to a single God while accepting the existence of other gods.

==Comparison to polytheism and dualism==
{{main|Polytheism}}
On the surface, [[monotheism]] is in contrast with [[polytheism]], which believes in worship of many [[Deity|gods]]/divinities. In actuality there are many faiths that hold both beliefs. For instance, Inclusive monotheism claims that all deities are just different names/forms for the single monotheistic God; [[Smartism]], a major denomination of Hinduism, adheres to this belief in the oneness of God ([[Brahman]]/[[Ishwar]]) who can be envisioned with different aspects and can be called by different names. Exclusive monotheism, on the other hand, claims that worship of divinities such as angels and gods that are other than the one God is incorrect or demonic, though they may believe in their existence. [[Vaishnavism]], a denomination of Hinduism, regards the worship of anyone other than [[Vishnu]] as incorrect. Exclusive monotheism is a well-known tenet in the beliefs of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s.

[[Dualism]], from a western religion's perspective, teaches that there are two independent [[Divinity|divine]] beings or eternal principles, the one [[Goodness and value theory|good]], and the other [[evil]], as set forth especially in early [[Zoroastrianism]] (modern Zoroastrianism is strictly monotheistic), but more fully in its later offshoots in 
[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems, such as [[Manichaeism]]. From the perspective of Hinduism, [[Dualism]] ([[Dvaita]]) is a monotheistic philosophy that teaches that a personal God is separate from his creation, there are therefore two ultimate realities and contrasts with [[monism]] that teaches a transcendent unity and that the material world is an illusion, there is therefore only one reality.
