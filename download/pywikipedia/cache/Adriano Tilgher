'''Adriano Tilgher''' (born [[1 October]] [[1947]] in [[Taranto]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[far right]] politician.

Tilgher began his career as a member of the [[Italian Social Movement]], although in his youth he was also associated with the extremist [[National Vanguard (Italy)|National Vanguard]], and attempted to refound it in [[1970]], a move which saw him arrested for attempting to refound the [[Fascist Party]]. He was arrested again for the same offence in [[1982]] and imprisoned until [[1987]] when he founded the ''Lega Nazionalpopolare'', later rebranded as ''Alternativa Nazional Popolare''. Both movements proved short-lived and lacking in support.

After giving up on the idea of leading his own movement he joined radical [[Fiamma Tricolore]] (a splinter-group of the newly constituted [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]) in [[1996]]. He was, however, expelled from Fiamma Tricolore in [[1997]] for his criticism of the leadership of [[Pino Rauti]] and in September of that year he set up his own party, '''Fronte Nazionale''', initially in imitation of the [[Front National (France)|Front National]], whose leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] Tilgher invited to [[Rome]] during the elections of that year. The party is now known as [[Fronte Sociale Nazionale]] and, although Tilgher is still leader, he is subordinate to [[Alessandra Mussolini]] in the [[Alternativa Sociale]] coalition.
