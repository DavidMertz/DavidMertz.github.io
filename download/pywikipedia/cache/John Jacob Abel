'''John Jacob Abel''' ([[May 19]], [[1857]] â€“ [[May 26]], [[1938]]) was a significant [[United States of America|American]] [[biochemistry|biochemist]] and [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]].

Born near [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], he founded and chaired in [[1891]] the first department of pharmacology in the United States at the [[University of Michigan]]. In [[1893]], he went on to establish and chair the pharmacology department at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (one of the many schools at which he was educated). In [[1897]], he was the first to isolate [[epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline. He later formulated the idea of the artificial [[kidney]] and in [[1914]] he isolated [[amino acids]] from the [[blood]].

He spent years unsuccessfully searching for the [[pituitary]] hormone, unaware that he was in fact looking for several hormones. In [[1926]], he reported the isolation and [[crystallization]] of [[insulin]], though this announcement was met with considerable scepticism and not generally accepted for many years.

Abel also founded the ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'' in [[1905]] and the ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics'' in [[1909]].
