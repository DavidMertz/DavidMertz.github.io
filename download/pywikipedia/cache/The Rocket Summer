'''The Rocket Summer''' is an [[alternative rock]] band from [[Grapevine, Texas]], comprised solely of [[Bryce Avary]] who plays all instruments and sings. Stylistically, The Rocket Summer is characterised by Avary's high-pitched vocals as well as the generally optimistic nature of the songs.

He started performing local shows as a teenager in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. As Avary's local fan base grew, he released his first EP in limited release during [[2000]]. Distributing the EP himself under the name The Rocket Summer to local stores to be sold on consignment, his music appeared on [[The Adventure Club]] segment of the [[KDGE]] radio station, and quickly became the most requested local band on the program that year.

With increased interest in the music from local, national and international magazines and the EP selling in 5 continents, in 2003 Avary recorded and released his debut album ''Calender Days'' with a $15,000 budget in [[Kansas]] under the [[The Militia Group]] label. The album was critically praised as being extremely uplifting, and included varied music (for example, a track including a grade 6 girls' choir from [[Colleyville, Texas]]). The album sold well in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].

In [[November 2004]], he began working with producer [[Tim O'Heir]] in [[Brooklyn]] to record his sophomore album ''Hello, Good Friend'' - the album title coming from the song "Never Knew". The Rocket Summer has toured with [[Hellogoodbye]], [[Relient K]] and Maxeen.

He has also signed with [[Island Def Jam Records]], a major label subsidiary, for his next record, which will not be produced until at least after the next tour.
