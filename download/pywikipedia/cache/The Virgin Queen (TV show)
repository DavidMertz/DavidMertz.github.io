'''''The Virgin Queen''''' was a 2005 [[BBC]]/Power co-production based upon the life of Queen [[Elizabeth I]], starring [[Anne-Marie Duff]]. It first aired in the United States in late 2005 on PBS' ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'', and later appeared on UK screens in January 2006 on the BBC. Running nearly four hours in length, it featured a host of well-known British actors and was notable for its high production values and unique soundtrack - containing songs by [[Martin Phipps]] and the [[Mediaeval Baebes]]. As a drama, it focused heavily on the Queen's private life - particularly her relationship with [[Robert Dudley]], and explored the politics of her reign in rather less depth. Its debut coincided with the release of the channel 4 series [[Elizabeth I (TV series)|''Elizabeth I'']], starring [[Helen Mirren]] in the lead role. 

==Themes==
Despite being a biopic of Elizabeth's life and reign, the series presented its main character with particular interest in several themes, most notably Elizabeth's belief in her divine right to rule and also the emotional impact of her mother's execution. Speaking of her character, Anne-Marie Duff said "Her sense of her own divine right is difficult for us to get hold of as human beings nowadays, but I think that's what is so appealing about her - that sense of entitlement and what it does to you." 

The drama was also very ambiguous on the subject of Elizabeth's virginity, it featured a scene where Elizabeth fantasizes about making love to Dudley, and noticeably excluded Elizabeth's near-death confession that nothing improper had ever taken place between them. However, Duff later revealed that the director and scriptwriter explicitly told her to play the Queen as a life-long virgin.

==Historical Accuracy==
Described by its producers as "... [a] regal portrait ... seeped in historical accuracy – passionate, emotional and full of the politics and social mores of the time", the series followed the general flow of history, but deviated from historical truth in numerous ways, such as below:

*In the film, Elizabeth meets with [[Lettice Knollys]] after a long estrangement. In fact, Elizabeth snubbed Lettice, although Essex arranged the meeting.
*Elizabeth died standing up in the movie. In reality, she was persuaded to lie on a pile of cushions.

==Official Story Synopsis==

''The Virgin Queen is an intimate account of Elizabeth I's rule.

''The tale begins when Elizabeth is a teenage princess imprisoned in the Tower of London by her half-sister Bloody Mary, charged with conspiracy and treason. Scared but determined the young Elizabeth fights for her life and for what she believes, as the protestant daughter of Henry VIII, is rightfully hers -- England's throne.''

''After Mary's death, Elizabeth plunges into her role as queen, discovering the harsh realities of ruling a country divided by faith and under threat from abroad. Convinced of her feminine weakness, the all-male Privy Council clamors to advise their inexperienced queen. Yet, Elizabeth soon learns how to outwit her enemies and charm those who conspire to their own ends, showing all the strength and resolve of her father.''

''Under constant pressure to marry, the coquettish Elizabeth rejects a string of wealthy European suitors, openly preferring the burning affections of her childhood playmate, the athletic, handsome -- and married -- Robert Dudley. But when Dudley's wife, Amy, is found dead, Elizabeth banishes Dudley, realizing that the scandal surrounding them could rock the very stability of England.''

''Surrounded by intrigue, conspiracy, torture and murder, Elizabeth struggles to balance her personal feelings with the rigors of the monarchy. The increasing clamor from her court and country to secure the throne transform the young queen into a liberated woman increasingly adamant that she will not be forced into a political marriage.''

''The Virgin Queen explores the fears, concerns, distastes and loves of the woman behind the crown, her duty as a monarch always taking precedence over her personal cravings.''

''In Elizabeth's own immortal words: "I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king."''

==Behind the scenes==
Costume creation for ''The Virgin Queen'' began a year in advance. The costume designers consulted a variety of sources, and created costumes that used colours to indicate character's moods and the progression of time.

When choosing locations, the production team wanted to present the full scope of England. The sand dunes near Bamburgh Castle were chosen for the Tilbury speech, whilst many castles and Tudor homes were also included in the project. The impressive State Receiving Chamber was in Middle Temple Hall, London. The gardens at Chastleton House were used for Elizabeth's royal gardens.

Martin Phipps composed the score. He was already well-known for his work on [[North and South|North and South (1854 Novel)]] for the BBC.

It is estimated by imdb that the production cost £9,000,000.
