'''PEN OS''' is an [[operating system]] which uses a [[stylus]] or similar [[pencil]]-shaped tool in place of a [[keyboard]] or [[mouse]].

According to a [http://www.leap-cf.org/oldarchive/2001-March/010100.html post] on a leaplist, [[Microsoft]] apparently took to using stylus-controlled Operating Systems after PenOS had kicked off.
Whether this site is correct or not remains disputed.
