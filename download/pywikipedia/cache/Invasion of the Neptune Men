'''''Invasion of the Neptune Men''''' (宇宙快速船 - ''Uchû Kaisokusen'' - Japanese for "Space Hypership") is a [[tokusatsu]] [[science fiction|SF]]/[[superhero]] film produced by [[Toei Company|Toei Company Ltd.]] (as "New Toei") in [[1961]].  The movie starred then 22-year old [[Sonny Chiba]] as Shinichi Tachibana, a scientist/astronomer who is, in reality, the intergalactic superhero '''Iron-Sharp'''.  (When listed in the credits in the Japanese version, "Iron Sharp" was played by "?", a gimmick often used in many similar Japanese superhero shows at the time!)  This was the only appearance of Iron-Sharp (who's dressed in silver tights, helmet, cape, carries a ray gun and rides a car-like rocketship), who is called "Space Chief" in the US version.  In either case, this film is similar to many a show in the [[Toei Superheroes|Toei Superhero]] genre from the same period, like ''[[Planet Prince]]'' (Toei's movie version).

Tachibana is friends with a group of children, who were almost attacked by a mysterious group of metallic aliens from an unknown planet (they're called "Neptune Men" in the US version), until Iron-Sharp, who drives away the aliens.  Even in human form, Tachibana is resourceful, as he helps the Japanese government invent a protective electric space barrier to block the aliens from entering the Earth.  But when the aliens could stand defeat no more, they announce to the Earth that they will strengthen their invasion, which throws the world into a state of fear and panic.  The invasion begins, and the aliens destroy cities in their awesome mothership (which launches smaller ships from within), but Iron-Sharp rides to the rescue . . .

The US version was titled ''Invasion of the Neptune Men'' and went directly to TV (it wasn't cropped since it was already filmed in fullscreen). It was later featured on the movie-mocking show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

==Trivia==

*The alien mothership prop was actually 6 feet long.  It was designed by veteran [[Toru Narita]], best known for his design work on ''[[Ultra Q]]'', ''[[Ultraman]]'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' and ''[[War of the Gargantuas]]''.  At the same period, he was an art director for the Toei superhero series, ''[[National Kid]]''.
*Actual [[World War II]] stock footage was used for some of the destruction of [[Tokyo]] scenes, most obvious when a multi-story picture of [[Adolf Hitler]] with some Japanese writing is clearly visible on the side of one building before it is destroyed.
