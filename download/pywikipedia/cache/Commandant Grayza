'''Commandant Mele-on Grayza''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[television]] series ''[[Farscape]]'', played by [[Rebecca Riggs]].

Grayza is a [[Sebacean]] female (although her pale white/grey countenance and dark lips may suggest some [[Nebari]] heritage) who has risen through the [[Peacekeeper]] ranks to achieve the status of [[Commandant]]. Politically astute and ruthlessly ambitious, she will use anyone or anything at her disposal to achieve her goals. To this end, she has had a gland implanted in her chest that secretes a substance known as Heppel oil, which she uses to bend her (male) victims to her will. A drawback to the gland is that it severely lowers her lifespan. To what degree it is lowered is not explored.

{{spoiler}}

Grayza is first seen towards the end of season three of the series, when she arrives aboard [[Scorpius (Farscape)|Scorpius]]' Command Carrier to put a stop to his [[wormhole]] research, considering it to be a threat to her efforts to negotiate a truce between the Sebaceans and the [[Scarran]] race. 

However, she becomes intrigued by [[John Crichton]] and his wormhole knowledge, believing it to be a potential bargaining chip in her dealings with the Scarrans and sets out to capture [[Moya]]. She is successful in tracking the crew down, and early in season 4, drugged and slept with Crichton: at the time it was to gain access - using more pleasurable interrogation methods - to his wormhole knowledge; the plan failed. Humiliated, Grayza directs Braca to keep searching for Moya - word spreads quickly to bounty-hunters of the price she puts on Crichton's head - but this also fails. Finally, when her bid for peace is lost, Grayza orders her Command Carrier to engage the Scarrans in conflict, only to be stopped by her subordinate Captain Meeklo [[Braca]], who assumes command. 

Although reported by Braca to be under sedation in the brig at the end of the series, by the time of [[Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars]], Grayza is seen as an advisor to the Peacekeeper Grand Chancellor, whilst also pregnant. The child's father is not explained: it could very well be the Chancellor or John Crichton. If the latter, Grayza's pregnacy could have been planned by her to get the wormhole knowledge from the child. The Scarran race had developed the science to remove knowledge from DNA, attempting to do just that from Crichton's unborn child with [[Aeryn Sun]]: it may well be assumed the Peacekeepers could do the same.

Grayza eventually kills the Chancellor when he tells her of his intentions to surrender to the Scarrans, and takes command of the Peacekeeper forces herself. When Crichton finally demonstrates the destructive powers of a wormhole weapon, she proposes a truce with the Scarrans "for the sake of our children". She is last seen aboard Moya, signing the peace treaty alongside [[Emperor Staleek]], overseen by the Eidelons.
