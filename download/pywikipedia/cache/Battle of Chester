The '''Battle of Chester''' or, in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the '''Battle of Caerlleon''', is generally agreed to have taken place in [[616]], as first argued by [[Charles Plummer]], although near contemporary annals give a variety of dates. It was fought between the Northumbrians of [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria|King Æthelfrith]] and a number of Northern [[Welsh people|Welsh]] kingdoms, certainly including [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Rhôs]]. Northumbria was victorious and Kings [[Selyf Sarffgadau]] of Powys and [[Cadwal Crysban]] of Rhôs were both killed in the slaughter. Circumstantial evidence suggests that [[Iago ap Beli|King Iago]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] may also have been amongst the dead.

[[Bede]] records that a large number of monks from [[Bangor-on-Dee]] "resorted...to pray at the...battle...King Ethelfrid being informed [of this]...said, "If then they cry to their God against us, in truth, though they do not bear arms, yet they fight against us, because they oppose us by their prayers." He, therefore, commanded them to be attacked first ... About twelve hundred of those that came to pray are said to have been killed". Bede thought this was divine retribution for the Welsh bishops having refused to submit to [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]].

The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] says, for year [[605]] in one version and year [[606]] in another version:-
:''And her Æðelfrið lædde his færde to Legercyestre, 7 ðar ofsloh unrim Walena. 7 swa wearþ gefyld Augustinus witegunge. þe he cwæþ. Gif Wealas nellað sibbe wið us. hi sculan æt Seaxana handa farwurþan. Þar man sloh eac .cc. preosta ða comon ðyder þæt hi scoldon gebiddan for Walena here. Scrocmail was gehaten heora ealdormann. se atbærst ðanon fiftiga sum.''
:And here Æðelfrið led his army to Chester, and there slew countless Welsh. And came about Augustinus's prophesy, that he said "If they do not have peace with us, they will die at the hands of the Saxons.". There also were slain 200 priests who came there to pray for the Welsh army. Scrocmail was called their leader, and he escaped as one of fifty."

In the 'Cleopatra' version of the [[Old Welsh|Welsh]] ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', this conflict is called the '''Battle of Perllan Fangor''' (Bangor Orchard), perhaps indicating that it took place nearer Bangor than [[Chester]]. However, archaeological excavations at [[Heronbridge]], just south of Chester, have discovered [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[grave (burial)|graves]] buried beneath a defensive earthwork over an old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement. They may possibly be the bodies of Northumbrian casualties lying beneath a fortress built by their fellows subsequent to the [[Angles|Anglian]] victory. 

The reasons behind the battle are unclear. Welsh tradition, chiefly expounded by the unreliable [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] says that [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria|King Æthelfrith]]'s political rival, [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin of Deira]] was living in exile in Gwynedd around this time. Oblique references in the writings of [[Reginald of Durham]] and the [[Welsh Triads]] may indicate that this was indeed the case. However, there is no evidence that Æthelfrith was in pursuit of this man, as historians such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] suggest. It has also been claimed that this battle finally severed the land connection between [[Wales]] and the [[Y Gogledd Hen|old northern]] [[Brython|Brythonic]] kingdoms of [[Rheged]] and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Alt Clut]] where the [[Cumbric]] language was spoken. However, whether this was by design or simply an accidental consequence is undetermined.

Some historians believe that [[King Arthur]]'s "ninth battle...in the City of the Legion", as recorded by [[Nennius]], is a misplaced reference to this later battle.
