'''Hillcrest''' is a neighborhood in [[Washington, D.C. (southeast)|southeast]] [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. Hillcrest is located in Ward 7, east of the Anacostia River--a section of Washington that is generally blighted, poor, and populated by working-class [[African Americans]]. Hillcrest, however, is a rather tony and well-kept neighborhood of affluent African Americans.

Hillcrest is bounded by [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] SE to the northeast, Southern Avenue to the southeast, and Fort Stanton Park to the west. Its main thoroughfare is Branch Avenue. Hillcrest is a residential neighborhood, although about one third of its area is occupied by Fort Davis Park.
