'''Gene Anderson''' (born [[1933]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] - [[October 31]], [[1991]]) was a [[professional wrestler]] famous for his days of teaming with his "brother" [[Ole Anderson]].

==Career==
Gene Anderson started wrestling in 1961 after being trained by [[Verne Gagne]]. In the late 1965, he formed the [[Minnesota Wrecking Crew]] with fellow collegian [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]] as his "brother". They wrestled in the [[Florida]] territories and won some tag team titles together.

Gene then reformed the tag team with his "brother" (another fellow collegian) [[Ole Anderson]] in 1969 after Lars left. They became one of the most successful heel tag teams in the history of professional wrestling. They dominated the Southeastern tag team scene until Gene retired to become a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] in 1981.

Gene and Ole would hold tryouts for wanna-be wrestlers during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They would beat the guys who showed up until they were bloodied and beaten. They also charged them for this torture. If anybody made it through that, they really had to want to be a wrestler. [[Allen Sarven|Al Snow]] is one that did.

When Gene quit wrestling, he became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] manager for a few years, before retiring from wrestling in 1984. During his career, he managed [[Oreeal Perras|Ivan Koloff]], [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]] and [[James Reiher|Jimmy Snuka]].

After retiring, Gene became a Deputy [[Sheriff]] in [[North Carolina]] but died of a sudden [[heart attack]] on [[October 31]], [[1991]].

==Trivia==
*Gene's son, [[Brad Anderson (wrestler)|Brad Anderson]], is also a professional wrestler and still competes on the independent circuit.
*Gene was only related to his son Brad. He ''was not'' related to Ole, Lars or Arn Anderson. He has sometimes been portrayed as [[Ric Flair]]'s cousin, but this is not true either. These are all [[kayfabe]] storylines.
