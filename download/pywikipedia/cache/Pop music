'''Pop music''' is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[popular music]] distinguished from [[Classical music|classical]] or Art music and from [[folk music]] <ref>*[[Simon Frith|Frith, Simon]] (2001). ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'', p.94. ISBN 0-521-55660-0 .</ref>. The term indicates specific stylistic traits such as an emotional singing style, lyrics about love or sex, danceable beat, clear melodies, simple harmonies and repetitive structure so that people can catch on and join in. This is not just typical of pop music but a world-wide music tool to engage communal singing. Pop music often includes elements of [[rock music|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dance music|dance]], and [[Country music|country]], making it a flexible category. There have been examples of pop music that break the norm, such as songs about current sports events or with strong ethnic flavours. e.g. Dreadlock Holiday "I don't like cricket" by [[10CC]].  Occasionally a purely instrumental composition makes it into the pop music charts. e.g. [[Music Box dancer]] 1970's by [[Frank Mills]].

The expression "pop music" may also be used to refer to particular subgenres (within the pop music genre) that are in some cases referred to as [[soft rock]] and [[pop/rock]]. The pop music genre also often involves mass [[marketing]] and consumer-driven efforts by major [[record companies]], which makes it an often scorned genre by other musicians. 

As records, CD's and DVD's became cheaper, the age of the average consumer of pop music has dropped dramatically.  In the early years of recordings, artists like Frank Sinatra sang about affairs, champagne and night clubs appealed to the investors, business, and classy market. As records became cheaper, teenagers were able to afford to influence the market especially during the promotion of the worldwide Beatles tours.  

Young people have always been interested in fashions and spend their money on new artists, whereas older people tend to keep to their favorite artists. Young people also conform more to peer pressure.  This conforming creates waves of commercial support for particular artists. Because young people are interest in pop music it an important mediator of [[youth culture]]. Partly because youth culture itself is an object of social concern, pop music has historically been the source of numerous [[moral panics]], especially as many of the styles that influence it trickle up from minority groups (racial, ethnic, sexual or class-based) about which the dominant class holds negative stereotypes. In addition, many parents view explicit lyrics as gateways to [[sin]], blaming pop music for perceived increases in dangerous behaviour within that age group.

The most recent phenomena that has occurred is the emergence of children's music as one of the biggest selling music (not just pop).  The [[Wiggles]] have earned more money that any other domestic artist in Australia. They have even franchised themselves to be able to perform internationally.  This supports that theory that young people, given enough wealth, drive the pop music market.

== History of Pop Music ==
=== 1890s through 1920s ===
The dance music element of western pop music can be traced back to [[Ragtime]], which was initially popular in African American communities, and mainly disseminated through sheet music and player pianos. Ragtime turned into [[Swing]], an early form of [[Jazz]] that was enjoyed as much for its danceability as its mutability. It is important to note that the clarity of the instruments (brass in particular) and punchy nature of the rhythm helped to ensure that these music forms were the first to be recorded and pressed onto primtive record discs. Both of these dance forms originated in African communities, and spread to white communities especially through venues that would hire black performers. Even early Jazz in Paris was influenced by Black and white minstrels performing ragtime music.  
Like Rock’n’roll, widespread popularity in white communities to some extent did not take off until white performers could be found to perform it, and certain stylistic elements of it toned down. The crossing of race-based social boundaries around race, for ragtime, swing, and later Rock’n’Roll, was the source of many moral panics in America inspired by pop music.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
Styles influencing the later development of pop include the [[Blues]], also originating in African-American communities, (for example, electric guitar Blues in Chicago), and [[Country music|Country]] coming also from "hillbilly music" of poor folk, white and black (Sun Records in Tennessee), which blended to become early Rock and Roll.
Leonard Bernstein in 1949 changed the face of popular music with his upbeat West Side Story. Also, the rise of the crying and emotional singers such as Mario Lanza began the pop music vocal style.

=== 1950s ===

Early Western Pop music artists include [[Tommy Steele]], [[Marty Wilde]],  [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]], and [[Peggy Lee]], but other artists like [[Bill Haley and his Comets]], [[Fats Domino]] and [[Elvis Presley]] became popular with the younger generation.  In Australia there was Johnny O'Keife, Col Joy and Bobby Darren.  Italian singers such Mario Lanser sang tunes people would could identify with and sing along.

In Iran, before the emergence in the early 1950s of [[Vigen Derderian]] (known as the "King of pop"), the music industry was dominated by Persian classical singers. He combined Persian melodies and Persian lyrics with Guitar. Compared by some fans to [[Elvis Presley]], Vigen's good looks and tall, fine physique added to his appeal as Iran's first male pop star - especially among women at a time when ideas of emancipation were taking hold in the 1950s and 60s.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/iran/story/0,12858,1093324,00.html Vigen Derderian: Pop idol of a musical revolution in Iran]</ref>
'''Laïkó''' was the pop music of Greece the 1950s and 1960s. Laïkó is similar to [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] [[fantasy music]]. It was criticized from all quarters for its apoliticism and decadence, and its Turkish roots.{{fact}}  The influence of [[Asian music|Oriental music]] on laïkó can be most strongly seen in 1960s [[indoyíftika]], [[India]]n [[filmi]] (popular music for movies) with [[Greek language|Greek]] lyrics. [[Manolis Angelopoulos]] was the most popular indoyíftika performer, while pure laïkó was dominated by superstar [[Stelios Kazantzidis]] and [[Stratos Dionisiou]].

Her recording of twelve songs in Italian and Spanish for the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] in 1973 became an overnight success. She also won  first prize at the Carthage Music Festival in 1972 and was honored with the first medal of arts of Tunisia in the same year.  Her Spanish song titled "Desde Hacies Tiempo" was an immediate hit in [[South America]] in 1973.

[[Image:Mariah Carey13 Edwards Dec 1998.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Mariah Carey]] at Edwards Air Force Base in Dec. 1998]]
The 1990s and 21st century were marked by a resurgence of [[boy band]] and [[girl group]] trends.

[[Image:BritneySpearsOops!...IDidItAgain.jpg|thumb|left|150px| [[Britney Spears]], a [[pop princess]] "born" in the 90's.]]

In the 2000s, [[hip-hop]] blended with pop music, paving the way for the multi-platinum successes of artists like [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Gwen Stefani]],  [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[the Pussycat Dolls]]. 

The divas of the 90s artists, such as [[Mariah Carey]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] presented comeback albums that prolonged their rule of the music charts.

Also coming along in 2006 was another Teen Singer [[Whitney Wolanin]] who scored 4 Hits Songs at radio including "GOOD" #7, "It Takes Two" #9, "Frosty the Snowman" #11, and "Christmas (the Warmest Time of the Year)" #83.

== Sound and themes ==
Pop music generally uses a simple, memorable melody and may use stripped-down rhythms. The songs are often about love or dancing. It is considered to be the most popular genre of music today.

Music videos and live performances are often used for exposure in the media, and artists may have extravagant stage shows and use choreographed dancing.{{Sectstub}}
