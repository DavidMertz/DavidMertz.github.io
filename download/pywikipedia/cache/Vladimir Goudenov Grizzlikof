'''Vladimir Goudenov Grizzlikof''' is a [[fictional character]] featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[animated]] [[television]] series ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''. His middle name is possibly a reference to [[Boris Godunov]], [[List of Russian rulers|Tsar of Russia]] from [[1598]] to [[1605]] or perhaps simply a Russian-ized version of "good enough".

Grizzlikof is the [[Russian language|Russian]]-accented [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[bear]] who is the chief agent of [[S.H.U.S.H.]], answering directly to director [[J. Gander Hooter]]. A tall and stocky, no-nonsense, by-the-book individual, Grizzlikof adheres slavishly to S.H.U.S.H. standard procedure regarding pretty much everything, and has clashed on numerous occasions with the well-meaning but ultimately egotistical [[Darkwing Duck]], whom he feels is a bad influence on S.H.U.S.H.'s agents.  He is extremely strong.  [[Launchpad McQuack]] once noted (probably exaggeratingly) that Grizzlikof "picks his teeth with a crow bar".  However in the same episode he did tear apart a briefcase with his teeth (not realizing it belonged to director Hooter).

However, for all his faults Grizzlikof is, deep down, a good person (or bear, rather), and very loyal to S.H.U.S.H., a fact revealed when he went so far as to feign letting [[Steelbeak]] persuade him to join [[F.O.W.L.]] in order to try and destroy the Fiendish Organization of World Larceny from within; even Darkwing has admitted that he likes "Grizz" on at least one occasion, after Grizzlikof had left the room.
