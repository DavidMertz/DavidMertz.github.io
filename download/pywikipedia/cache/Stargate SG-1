In the [[Stargate]] [[science fiction]] [[fictional universe|universe]], a network of ancient [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]] connect the far reaches of the Milky Way galaxy opening the door of instantaneous interplanetary travel. <!-- the workings of the stargate should be detailing elsewhere --> ''Stargate SG-1'' chronicles the exploits of [[SG-1]], one of at least twenty elite SG teams tasked with exploring the galaxy and defending Earth from the [[Goa'uld]].  
 
== Show summary ==

The original members of [[SG-1]] are [[Jack O'Neill|Col. Jack O'Neill]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]]), [[Daniel Jackson|Dr. Daniel Jackson]] ([[Michael Shanks|Shanks]]), [[Samantha Carter|Capt. Samantha Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping|Tapping]]) and [[Teal'c]] ([[Christopher Judge|Judge]]).<!-- please do not add information about how this has changed - that's explained below. --> The Earth stargate, found at a dig site near Giza in 1928, is housed in a [[Classified Information|top-secret]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[military base]] known as the [[SGC]] (Stargate Command) underneath Cheyenne Mountain. From there SG-1 and other SG teams journey to distant planets in search of defenses from the [[Goa'uld]].  The parasitic Goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship.

The primary goal of the [[SG teams]] is established in the pilot episode of SG-1: travel to other worlds through the Stargate and procure alien technology to help defend Earth against the [[Goa'uld]]. Throughout the first eight seasons, the [[Goa'uld]] are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race was the [[System Lord]] [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] ([[Peter Williams (actor)|Peter Williams]].  Other system lords such as [[Baal (Stargate)|Baal]] and [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] play pivotal roles as the seasons progress. In the ninth season, a new villain is introduced in the form of the [[Ori]], advanced beings from another galaxy with unfathomable technology.  The introduction of the [[Ori]] accompanies an exploration of the [[Arthurian]] mythology surrounding them, their followers, and their enemies - the [[Ancients]].

Human civilizations at varying stages of development exist on numerous planets as a result of human enslavement by the Goa'uld for thousands of years. [[''Stargate SG-1'']] follows and expands upon the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] mythologies presented in [[Stargate]], while also incorporating other Earth cultures such as those of the [[Aztec]]s, [[Mayan]]s, [[Briton]]s, the [[Nordic countries|Norse]], [[Mongol]]s, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]s, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s. Many famous mythical locations such as [[Avalon (Stargate)|Avalon]], [[Camelot (Stargare)|Camelot]], and [[Atlantis (Stargate Atlantis)|Atlantis]] have been found either existent or to have existed. Additionally, fictional origins are presented for real religions and mythologies.

Typically, the show opens with SG-1 exploring a new planet for potential technology and allies.  Upon discovery of civilized settlements Daniel Jackson, the [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[history|historian]], often takes further interest in [[anthropology]], alien [[society]], [[culture]], and even [[morality|moral]] issues encountered, thereby examining philosophical, moral, and ethical dillemas.  

Human curiosity is often depicted as a double edged sword, and major events - including the introduction of new villains - often result from this:  
* After ignoring it for almost five thousand years, the [[Goa'uld]] come to realize Earth is a threat only after humanity re-activates the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] and defeats the [[System Lord]] [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]].
* The [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]] are a product of an [[android]] who was created by a human (most probably [[Ancients (Stargate)|Alteran]]) scientist.
* The [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] became aware of the Milky Way galaxy after [[Daniel Jackson]] and [[Vala Mal Doran]] activate an [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancient]] communication device that sends their consciousnesses to the Ori galaxy.
* Physical and biological threats to Earth are brought through the gate.
{{see also|Stargate Atlantis}}

The series frequently references other television and film productions such as [[Star Wars]], [[Star Trek]], [[The Wizard of Oz]], and [[The Simpsons]]. A recurring motif is the way in which human characters from Earth speak in naturalistic, everyday language, while most characters from other planets use a more eloquent, archaic variant of English. This is also present in ''Stargate Atlantis'' and is typically played for humor, especially when characters such as Teal'c attempt to use human slang terms. There are, however, exceptions to this rule such as Jonas Quinn and Vala Mal Doran.

The decade-old show remains popular; in 2004, ''[[TV Guide]]'' suggested that its popularity may be exceeding that of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. Testifying to its vigor, [[Stargate SG-1]] broke [[Nielsen Ratings]] records for the U.S. [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] throughout its eighth season, whose two-part episode "[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]" was widely regarded by fans as one of the show's five best episodes,<ref name="popularity">{{cite web|url=http://www.geos.tv/index.php/topten/stg |title=Stargate SG-1 Top 10 episodes| publisher=Global Episode Opinion Survey (GEOS)| accessdate= 2006-07-30}}</ref>. Although Richard Dean Anderson departed as a regular after season 8, he made guest appearances in several episodes of seasons 9 and 10 of SG-1 and season 3 of [[Stargate Atlantis]].

{{Main|List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Timeline of Stargate}}

[[Image:stargatesg1season1title.jpg|thumb|[[Children of the Gods (Stargate SG-1)|The pilot episode's]] opening title]] 
{{sgspoiler|1}}

When [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] attacks Earth at the beginning of the series (which is set one year after the events of the [[Stargate (film)|original film]]), the [[SGC]] military base is brought back into action, and [[SG teams]] are created, the prime of which is [[SG-1]], to help defend Earth from the new threat. It is quickly revealed that Apophis is but one of many [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s who battle for power in the galaxy. The Stargate itself is also revealed to connect not only Earth and [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]] but to be one of many gates forming an enormous network connecting countless planets. The [[Goa'uld]] are parasitic beings that take control of other bodies (usually humans). The [[System Lords]] are shown to possess Intergalactic pyramid shaped warships and vast armies of footsoldiers, the bulk of these forces consisting of modified humans known as [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]].

The lives of SG-1 are saved by [[Teal'c]], the first prime of [[Apophis]], who defects in hopes the [[Tau'ri]]  can defeat the Goa'uld.  Earth has become exposed as a threat to Goa'uld power, and comes under attack.

{{sgspoiler|2}}

[[SG-1]] and the [[SGC]] forge several alliances with other races in the galaxy, such as the [[Tok'ra]]. The Tok'ra are the same species as the [[Goa'uld]], but are opposed to the [[System Lord]]s, and blend with their hosts willingly to ''share'' their bodies. Other races depicted include the [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]] and other advanced human civilizations. They also encounter races that have been surviving in the galaxy for millennia, such as the [[Nox (Stargate)|Nox]], the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]], and the remnants of an extinct race that comes to be known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. It is later discovered that the Ancients had been the most advanced race in history, and were themselves the builders of the Stargates.

In the background of the show, there is a constant attempt by forces on Earth to take control of the Stargate. In particular, rogue [[NID (Stargate)|NID]] agents, which eventually become the elite syndicate known as [[Trust (Stargate)|The Trust]], constantly try to steal the Stargate or use alien technology for their own ends. The political powers on Earth are often at odds over the Stargate, particularly after the program is revealed to ambassadors from the other main powers of Earth.

{{sgspoiler|3}}

Besides the Goa'uld, another threat arises in Season 3, namely a race of non-sentient machines called [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s. These Replicators had rarely posed a direct threat to the Milky Way galaxy, but were revealed as being on the verge of wiping out the Asgard.

{{sgspoiler|4}}

Engaging with Replicators in the premiere of Season 4, the show begins to spread away from its Goa'uld-orientated roots, instead focusing on stand-alone episodes and explores alternative concepts for episodes. Throughout the season, SG-1 encounters everything from genocidal civilizations, to advanced strength-enhancing gauntlets, to a newly recurring species, the [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]]. The season ends with a large battle against the Goa'uld System Lord [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]].

{{sgspoiler|5}}

After Apophis is conquered in Season 5, another Goa'uld System Lord takes his place as the show's main villain, [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]]. Anubis is considerably more evil than Apophis, and has much knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. The theme of [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascension]] is introduced fully, explaining that the Ancients survived extinction by Ascending to a higher plane of existence. Anubis tried to do this as well, to harvest the vast knowledge and power in that plane, but was cast down again, leaving him in a dangerous half-Ascended state. Anubis gains great power by using Ancient technology and stealing Asgard technology.  [[Daniel Jackson]] sacrifices his life to prevent disaster on another plantet. With help from [[Oma Desala]], an ascended Ancient, Daniel too ascends to a higher plane of existance.

[[Image:Stargate SG-1 Season 8 Title.jpg|thumb|[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Season 6]]'s opening title]]
{{sgspoiler|6}}

The death of Daniel Jackson leaves an open position with SG-1.  In Season 6 [[Jonas Quinn]] fills Daniel's role as Dr. Jackson is now engaged in cosmic affairs on a higher plane. Occasionally, he appears to his friends to help them out, but only appears to them individually, often causing them to think that they are hallucinating. However, in the Season 6 finale, Anubis threatens to destroy [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]], the planet most dear to Daniel apart from Earth, and Daniel promises to stop Anubis.

{{sgspoiler|7}}

Daniel is ultimately unable to keep Anubis from destroying Abydos as the other Ascended beings have a rule against interfering in the affairs of mortal beings and stop him from using his abilities to intervene. His transgression results in his return to the mortal plane of existence, allowing him to re-join SG-1 again. Soon after Daniel's return, Jonas Quinn is finally accepted back on his home world and leaves the SGC. Throughout Season 7, Anubis consolidates his power by wiping out other System Lords, whilst Daniel and the SGC search for the [[Lost City (Stargate)|Lost City]] of the Ancients wherein powerful technology capable of defeating Anubis lays dormant. In the Season 7 finale, an Ancient Outpost is located in Antarctica, and Jack O'Neill is able to use the weapons there to annihilate Anubis's entire fleet.

{{sgspoiler|8}}

In Season 8, the System Lord [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] subsumes much of Anubis's power, but Anubis is discovered to remain alive, due to his half-Ascended state. He eventually comes to rule secretly over Ba'al as well. Alongside this, the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s escape and begin to conquer the System Lords. A human-form Replicator ("[[RepliCarter]]") is created in the image of [[Samantha Carter]], and this Replicator becomes the most powerful force in the galaxy.

Towards the end of Season 8, Anubis seeks to destroy all life in the galaxy so he can remake it as he sees fit. He seeks to do this using the [[Dakara Superweapon]]. However, [[SG-1]] reaches the weapon first and realigns it to destroy only the Replicators throughout the galaxy. They achieve this end, but not before Daniel is killed by RepliCarter. Once again, he finds himself in the Ascended plane (again Oma has helped him). There he learns Oma assisted Anubis in ascending.  Daniel is able to convince Oma of the danger posed by Anubis and she stops him once and for all. Daniel Jackson then returns once more to the mortal plane and arrives at the SGC. Ba'al is forced by the Jaffa Rebellion to flee.  The System Lords have been decimated, the Replicators annihilated, and the Jaffa have won their freedom.

{{sgspoiler|9}}

In Season 9, [[Jack O'Neill]] leaves the SGC and [[SG-1]] to be replaced by [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] ([[Ben Browder]]), with [[Hank Landry]] ([[Beau Bridges]]) taking control of the [[SGC]] itself. It is discovered that Ba'al fled to Earth and is rebuilding his power from there, whilst the [[Goa'uld]] have infiltrated The Trust.

An accidental visit to a distant galaxy by Daniel Jackson and [[Vala Mal Doran]] draws the attention of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way. The [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] influence the mortal plane through commanding [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]], mortals that they evolved and enhanced. These [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]] spread and uphold a religion called [[Origin (Stargate)|Origin]]. Followers of this religion are falsely promised Ascension, and unknowingly augment the power of the Ori, who begin to make incursions into the Milky Way, with the ultimate goal of converting all sentient species and destroying the Ancients. Vala joins SG-1.  

When SG-1 learns [[Ancient characters in Stargate#Moros.2FMerlin.2FMyrddin|Merlin]], a formerly Ascended Ancient and founder of the Arthurian legends, had been secretly working on [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Holy Grail|a weapon]] to incapacitate or destroy Ascended beings as a means of defense against the Ori, they travel to the planet where he was said to have left it. There they find a village, Camelot, with a [[King Arthur|sword in a stone]] and discover the "weapon" is no less than the origin of the [[Holy Grail]] myth, and is long lost. The Ori attempt to establish a beachead in the Milky Way galaxy by creating a giant Supergate through which they shall launch their crusade. Vala Mal Doran is accidently transported to the Ori galaxy where she finds herself pregnant with a child apparently immaculately concieved. The Ori manage to open a [[Supergate (Stargate)|Supergate]] into the Milky Way and send four [[Ori battlecruiser]]s to begin their evangelical crusade; they effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of Asgard, Earth, Jaffa, and Lucian Alliance ships.

[[Image:Sg1 cast1-1-.jpg|thumb|[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Season 10]] cast of SG-1]]
{{sgspoiler|10}}

In Season 10, [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]], the daughter of [[Vala Mal Doran|Vala]], is born and ages rapidly.  She is the [[Orici (Stargate)|Orici]], the leader of Ori forces in the Milky Way. As the Ori invade, SG-1 continues its search for Merlin's anti ascended-being weapon, the Sangraal (Holy Grail). However, they must now contend with [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] and his [[cloning|clones]], who are attempting to find and use the weapon for their own purposes.

Following a visit to [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], Daniel learns of two planets that may contain the weapon. The information came to him via an ascended ancient known throughout history as [[Ancient characters in Stargate#Morgan le Fay|Morgan Le Fay]]. Before helping Daniel further, she is punished for interfering in mortal affairs. The Jaffa attempt to use the [[Dakara superweapon]] to wipe out the crew of an Ori ship allowing for its capture.  Adria survives and destroys the weapon at Dakara.  [[Langara]], home world of Jonas Quinn falls to the Ori.  Episode three of season 10 marks the first visit of SG-1 to the Pegasus galaxy and [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], [[Teal'c]] does not make the journey. Season 10 also features the first joint mission between SG-1 and Atlantis. The 200th episode was aired during this season.

On [[August 21]], [[2006]], the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] confirmed that ''Stargate SG-1'' has been canceled after ten seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=37607|title=SG-1 Ends Run; Atlantis Back| publisher=GateWorld| date=2006-08-22| accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> However, Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told [[GateWorld]] that they are hard at work looking for a new outlet for the story to continue.

<blockquote>"As far as the future, I can't comment yet because nothing has been confirmed," Cooper said. "What we want to emphasize is that the franchise is not dying. ''SG-1'' will go on in some way. We're just not ready to announce how."  Cooper also emphasizes that, though emotions are running high among Stargate fans who have just learned the news, it is important to keep the show's ratings strong throughout the remainder of its run on SciFi. "What's most important is that fans don't take out their frustration with SciFi by not watching", he said. "In fact, what they need to do is watch both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis LIVE'' and make sure the ratings stay strong. That helps prove to other outlets that might be interested in ''SG-1'' that the show is still as strong as we think it is."<ref name="coopersg1">{{cite web |author=Darren Sumner |authorlink=GateWorld |publisher=GateWorld |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/cooper_isg-1i_will_go_on.shtml |title=Cooper: SG-1 will go on|date=2006-08-21| accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref></blockquote>

Mark Stern, executive VP of original programming for the Sci Fi Channel stated that the cancellation "was not a ratings-based decision", adding that the production staff have been given enough time to tie up all the loose ends and to create a good ending for the show.  Stern has also said that SciFi plans to use some ''SG-1'' members on the still-continuing spin-off ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Dempsey, Ben Fritz|authorlink=|work=Variety News|publisher=Reed Business Information|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117948764?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Sci Fi's 'Stargate' swinging closed|date=2006-08-21|accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>  However, the term "''cancellation''", as applied by Sci Fi Channel, are orders for ''SG-1'' episodes from MGM/Sony.  They have merely cancelled their order for new episodes. MGM, the rights holder, has expressed a desire to continue ''SG-1'' through another outlet, suggesting that another network may pick up the series. This means that the series is not actually cancelled, but simply on hold.  MGM announced that they wish to continue the SG-1 series, either as a movie, mini-series or an eleventh season on some other network, suggesting that G4 and Showtime have presented interest in such an option. However, the Sci Fi Channel is attempting to block the action, citing their contract with MGM.<ref>{{cite web |author=Darren Sumner |authorlink=GateWorld |publisher=GateWorld |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/mgm_considers_isg-1is_future.shtml|title= MGM considers SG-1's future|date=2006-08-26| accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>.
On Tuesday September 26 gateworld.net released news that IGN had reported that there will not be an eleventh season but rather that there will be a series of SG-1 TV Movies, the report cites an unnamed cast member.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/09/studio_planning_isg-1i_tv_movies.shtml Studio planning SG-1 TV movies?], by Darren Sumner, GateWorld, ''September 26, 2006''</ref>

[[December 14]], [[2006]], Production sources have informed GateWorld that a new spin off series is in the idea stage, and is being actively worked on by the same creative minds behind Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. There has not been any plotlines released as of this time.
Going off of previous releases of SG-1 and Atlantis people should not expect a release until 2008

On [[December 20]], [[2006]], confirmed reports from GateWorld confirmed the production of two movies, with filming expected to begin in late April of 2007. The regular cast of Stargate would be part of the cast. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper will both write and direct the first movie. The first movie "has to do with wrapping up the Ori storyline, which is the storyline that has taken prominence for the last two years of the show," said cast member Michael Shanks. The second movie starts shooting June 1. Executive producer Brad Wright will write the second film, with Martin Wood directing. That story is a time travel story taking SG-1 to the past. "It has something to do with our main villain Ba'al [[Cliff Simon]] doing something in the past," Shanks said. "He basically finds a way to lift the Stargate from Earth so the Stargate Program never happens, and I imagine the characters will have to go through some process to reset the clock and fix everything."

[[December 22]], [[2006]], Gateworld reports with M.G.M. beginning production of the first direct to DVD movie, '''MGM and the show's Vancouver-based producers are no longer pursuing an eleventh season.''' Both of the expected direct to DVD films are most likely going to be released in the Fall of 2007, and the possibility of future films remains high.

== Show history ==

Developed for television by [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]], the series is produced by [[MGM]] and filmed at [[Bridge Studios]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The first episode was broadcast on [[July 27]], [[1997]] on [[Showtime]] in the US and [[December 3]], [[1997]] on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia. Showtime produced and aired the series' first five seasons. Since season six, it has been produced and aired by the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]]. ''SG-1'' became the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, surpassing the nine seasons and 202 episodes of the ''[[The X-Files]]''. It is also listed in the 2007 [[Guinness World Records]] as the "longest running science fiction show (consecutive)";  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm |title= Dr Who 'longest-running sci-fi', Stargate 'longest-running sci-fi(consecutive)'| publisher=BBC News| accessdate= 2006-09-29}}</ref> [[Doctor Who]] fans dispute this claim, as over 600 episodes of the British show were produced and shown consecutively between 1963 and 1989. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/09/23/36558.shtml] A [[spin-off]] series, ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', began airing in 2004. The two shows now run in tandem, with plots that are occasionally interconnected, and story timelines that are simultaneous.

On [[August 21]], [[2006]] the Sci-Fi channel announced that it would not be renewing the show for an eleventh season; however, executive producer [[Robert C. Cooper]] has said that ''SG-1''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story will continue in a yet-to-be-announced form.<ref name="coopersg1" /> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] has announced that they are very keen to carry on the Stargate SG-1 story, and that they "intend to vigorously find a way to extend the franchise." The last day of shooting for season 10 was on [[October 5]], [[2006]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/blogs/bartok/2006/10/last-day-of-shooting-wow.shtml|title= Last day of shooting wow| publisher=Ivon Bartok| work=GateWorld| accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref>

In December 2006, there were suggestions that a third Stargate series was being developed by the team behind Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml|title= Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development| publisher=Darren Sumner| work=GateWorld| accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

In ''[[Children of the Gods (Stargate SG-1)|Children of the Gods]]'', the pilot episode for the series, when Samantha Carter sees a [[Dial-Home Device|DHD]] for the first time, she comments on how it took "fifteen years and three supercomputers to [[MacGyver#MacGyverisms|MacGyver]] a system for the gate on Earth." This is a reference to Anderson's well-known portrayal of the TV character [[MacGyver]].
{{wikiquote|Stargate_SG-1#Oz_references|Oz references in Stargate SG-1}} 
Throughout the show, there are many references to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', mainly by Col. O'Neill, as well as many references to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as Jack O'Neill's favorite television series &mdash; It is, in fact, Richard Dean Anderson's as well. In ''[[Citizen Joe (Stargate SG-1)|Citizen Joe]]'', [[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of [[Homer Simpson]], made a guest appearance as Joe Spencer. In turn, Richard Dean Anderson later made a guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'' in the seventeenth season episode ''[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]'' as himself.

The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] cooperates closely with the makers of the program. Two successive [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chiefs of Staff of the USAF]], Generals [[Michael E. Ryan]] and [[John P. Jumper]], have appeared in the show, playing themselves. Ryan appeared in the episode "[[Prodigy (Stargate SG-1)|Prodigy]]" because of his fascination with science fiction, especially space exploration. Jumper made a cameo appearance in "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", the episode that was originally slated to be the show's last.

=== Literature ===
{{main|Stargate literature#Stargate SG-1}}

Several novels has been published based in ''Stargate SG-1''. From 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in  [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

===Comics===
{{main|Stargate Comics}}
A series of comics has also been published by [[Avatar Press]].

== Differences between the film and series ==
The original film did not develop as much of the setting's depth as would be needed in a television series. [[MGM]], which owned the rights, took Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's product and handed the reins to a new team of creators (Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner). This new team introduced many new concepts to make the Stargate universe into a workable weekly science fiction show. Also, certain details were changed.

For example, in the film:
* [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]'s species was not named, and Ra was presented as using a sort of incorporeal "possession" of a human host instead of direct biological parasitism.
*The symbols on the Abydos Stargate in the film were different from the symbols from Earth's Stargate. (In the series all the symbols are the same)
* A few names were spelled differently or changed, which has been a source of in-jokes and pedanticism ever since:
** Colonel Jack O'Neill's name was spelled ''O'Neil''.
** Colonel Jack O'Neill's wife/ex-wife was named ''Sarah'' rather than ''Sara''.
** Colonel Jack O'Neil's son was named ''Tyler'' rather than ''Charlie''.
** Dr. Jackson's wife's name was ''Sha'uri'', rather than ''Sha're''.
* A Goa'uld shown briefly in the movie was humanoid instead of snakelike.
* According to the film, Abydos was located in the [[Kaliem galaxy]], "on the far side of the known universe", but in the series it is one of the closest Stargates to Earth, in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].
* The Air Force base was under Creek Mountain in the film, but in the series it is [[Cheyenne Mountain]].
* The first time Daniel Jackson sees the Stargate is after he figures out the seven-coordinate address system, but in the TV episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", he tells [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] that "I remember when we were first trying to get the Stargate to work, I would just come here, and stare at it for hours." 
* In the episode "[[The Torment of Tantalus (Stargate SG-1)|The Torment of Tantalus]]", it was clearly stated [[Catherine Langford]] was twenty-one in 1945, which would make her about four years old in 1928. However, she is much older in the opening sequence of the film, which is set in that year.
* In the episode "[[Children of the Gods (Stargate SG-1)|Children of the Gods]]", O'Neill told General Hammond that their "first clue" Ra was an alien was the fact that his eyes glowed. In the film, O'Neill did not encouter Ra until after Daniel Jackson had discovered he was an alien. It is likely that O'Neill was merely using a figure of speech.

Several of these differences were simply ignored by the TV series, but others have been addressed in various episodes of ''Stargate SG-1''. For example, it was sarcastically mentioned at one point that there is another Colonel named Jack O'Neil whose name is often mixed up with Jack O'Neil'''l''''s (and who "has no sense of humor"). Other changes have been explained as advances in technology, such as more precise "aiming" by Earth's dialing computer (to compensate for the drift of the planets in 10,000 years) that prevents the frost effect seen in the movie. Others are most likely just oversights.

Because of these differences, some fans of the film consider the television series as its own separate entity, rather than a proper sequel to the film.{{fact}} Using some of Emmerich's notes, Bill McCay wrote a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned. However, recently Dean Devlin stated that there was an interest in creating the original sequels and that the McCay books were not correct.<ref>[http://gateworld.net/news/2006/07/devlin_optimistic_about_stargate.shtml Devlin optimistic about 'Stargate' sequels], by Darren Sumner, GateWorld, ''July 21, 2006''</ref>
