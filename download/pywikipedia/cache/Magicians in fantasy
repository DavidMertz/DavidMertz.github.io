A '''magician''', or '''wizard''' or '''sorcerer''' or several other possible names (see Names and terminology), is someone who uses or practices magic that derives from [[supernatural]] or [[occult]] sources.<ref>[[Patricia A. McKillip]], "Writing High Fantasy", p 54, Philip Martin, ed., ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', ISBN 0-87116-195-8</ref> Magicians are most commonly found in works of [[fantasy]], such as [[mythology]], [[legends]], [[folklore]], [[fantasy fiction|fantasy-themed works of fiction]], and [[role-playing games]].  Although occasional practitioners of  [[Sleight of hand|sleight-of-hand]] appear in modern fantasy, they are simulating the magic that others perform -- or sometimes concealing their actual magic.

The magicians discussed in this article, as is usual in fantasy, have powers arising from their study, possibly based on innate talent, rather than have their magical abilities occur entirely spontaneously, or be granted by another source.  (See [[Magic (fantasy)]] for the general case.)

==History of fantasy wizards==
Historically, many writers who have written about fictional magicians, and many readers of such works, have believed that such magic is possible -- in [[William Shakespeare]]'s time, witches like the Weird Sisters in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and wizards like Prospero in ''[[The Tempest]]'' (or [[Doctor Faustus]] in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play) were widely considered to be real -- and many noted scholars, such as [[Virgil]], acquired legends of being wizards.<ref name="grant-wizards">[[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Wizards", p 1027 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

Modern writers, and readers, usually deal with magic as imaginary, as part of the imaginary worlds in which they work.<ref name="grant-magic">[[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Magic", p 616 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

Still, such historical figures and beliefs have played a large role in the development of the fantasy figure.<ref name="atwood">[[Margaret Atwood]], ''Negotiating With the Dead'', p 114-5, ISBN 0-521-66260-5</ref>

==Character function==
In medieval chivalric [[Romance (genre)|romance]], the wizard often appears as a [[wise old man]] and acts as a mentor<ref>[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 195, ISBN 0-691-01298-9</ref>.  Other witches and magicians can appear as villains, as hostile to the hero as ogres and other monsters. <ref>[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 193, ISBN 0-691-01298-9</ref>

This role was taken up into fantasy.  [[Ursula K. LeGuin]], considering the work that was to become ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'', noted that wizards were usually elderly or ageless, which she considered proper, but her own work stemmed from question of how wizards learned their art.<ref>Ursula K. LeGuin, "Dreams Must Explain Themselves", p 41, ''The Language of the the Night: Essays On Fantasy and Science Fiction'', ISBN 0-425-05205-2</ref>  This theme has been further developed in modern fantasy, often leading to wizards as heroes on their own quests, alongside works where the wizard appears as a mentor figure, or a villain.<ref>Justin Fike, [http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/fike14.html "The Role of Wizards in Fantasy Literature"]</ref>

Wizards can act the part of the [[absent-minded professor]], being foolish, prone to misconjuring, and generally less than dangerous; they can also be terrible forces, capable of great magics that work good or evil.<ref>Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 140-1, ISBN 0-87116-195-8</ref>

(See "Use of Magic", below, for their place in world-building.)

==Names and terminology==
People who work magic are called by many names in works of fantasy, and the terminology differs widely from one [[fantasy world]] to another.  While derived from real world vocabulary, "wizard", "[[witch]]", "[[warlock]]", "[[Incantation|enchanter]]/enchantress", "sorcerer/sorceress", "[[magician]]", "mage", or "[[Magi|magus]]"  have within a work of fantasy the meaning the writer invests in them.  The term [[archmage]], with "arch" indicating "pre-eminent", may be used to indicate a powerful magician, or a leader of magicians.<ref name="grant-wizards"/>

When a writer uses more than one term for reasons other than gender-based titles, except in the rarest of cases, it is to sharply distinguish between two types of magic.  The precise nature of what the distinction is differs from writer to writer, and the usage can flip-flop between works.  In the [[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]], [[Patricia Wrede]] depicts wizards who use magic based on their staffs, and magicians who practice many kinds of magic, including the wizards'; in the [[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Regency fantasies]] she and [[Caroline Stevermer]] depict magicians as identical to wizards except for being inferior in skill and training.

Within a given work, such distinctions can be all important, as the writer defined them.  [[Steve Pemberton]]'s ''The Times & Life of Lucifer Jones'' describes the distinction thus: "The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten."

In role-playing games, the types of practitioners of magic are far more clearly delineated, and named, in order that players and game masters may know the rules by which they are played.  In the original edition of [[Dungeons and Dragons]], [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] invented the term "[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)#Magic-user|magic-user]]" as a generic term for a practioner of magic (in order to avoid cultural connotations of terms such as "wizard" or "warlock"); this lasted until the second edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, where it was replaced with "mage" (later to become "wizard"). 

Some names, distinctions, or aspects may have more of a negative [[connotation]], than others, depending on the setting and the context. (See also [[Magic (paranormal)#In Judaism and Christianity|Magic]] and [[Magic and religion#Magic and Abrahamic religion|Magic and religion]], for some examples.)  

===Gender-based titles===
[[Image:John William Waterhouse - Circe (The Sorceress).JPG|250px|right|thumb|"The Sorceress" by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
The term "[[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]" is more often applied to a male magic-user, as in [[Ursula K. LeGuin]]'s ''[[Earthsea]]'', just as a "witch" is more often female, as in [[Andre Norton]]'s ''[[Witch World]]''. In ''Witch World'', a man who, anomolously, showed the same abilities as the witches was termed a warlock. The term "warlock" is sometimes used to indicate a male witch in fiction.

However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title.  If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practicers of identical magic, such as in [[Harry Potter]], or it can indicate that the two sexes practice different types of magic, as in [[Discworld]].<ref name="grant-wizards"/>

While "enchantress" is the feminine of "enchanter," "sorceress" may be the feminine, not only of "sorcerer" but of "wizard" or "magician", which terms have no precise feminine equivalent.  [[Piers Anthony]], in the comic [[Xanth]] series, describes "sorceress" as "sexist for magician."

===Types of magic===
While the terms are used loosely, some patterns of naming are more common than others.

Enchanters often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target, creating illusions.  Enchantresses, in particular, practice this form of magic, often to seduce.<ref>[[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Enchantress", p 318 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

Sorcerer is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil.  This may derive from its use in [[sword and sorcery]], where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent.<ref>[[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Sorcery", p 885 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

[[Hedge wizard]] or hedge witch is a widely used contemptuous term for a magician whose magic is unable to win him enough of a living to keep him from poverty or even vagrancy.  Herb witch is less contemptuous, and generally indicates skill with plants (whether magically making them grow or using them magically), but generally also indicates a low level of education, and possibly skill.  Such characters are often taught informally, by another hedge wizard, rather than receive a formal apprenticeship or education at a school.

Terms derived from more specific magics, such as voodoo, alchemy, or [[Necromancy in fiction|necromancy]], generally remain closer to their real-world inspirations.  Fantasy necromancers often work magic that has something to do with death, although the exact connections vary widely from work to work.

==Traits of Magicians==
A common motif in fictional magic is that the ability to use it is innate and often rare.<ref name="grant-magic"/>  In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], it was limited to non-humans — even [[Aragorn]], whose hands heal, has some [[elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] blood — but in many writers, it is reserved to a select group of humans, as in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books, [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s ''[[Deryni novels]]'', or [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' universe.  This is often a secretive or persecuted group.  In these settings, non-magician characters, no matter how learned, cannot actually cast spells.  In such instances, magic could be inherited, or perhaps it is a random ability appearing in some children, or the result of some other unique effect or situation.  Inherited powers may be a simple genetic trait -- for Katherine Kurtz's Deryni, a sex-linked trait -- or appear apparently at random in lines that have the blood, as in [[Patricia A. McKillip]]'s ''[[The Riddle Master Trilogy]]'', where the [[shapeshifting]] Earthmasters attempt to get their blood into royal houses, but fail because although one succeeds in getting the king's wife pregnant, the child's descendants rarely have the powers.

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] are more likely the most magicians to have their powers be the result of study.  For them, and most other practitioners of magic that is not innate, the study is long and hard.  This can produce a lack of magicians even when anyone could in theory learn the art.

Magical practicioners on the Disc (of the [[Discword]] series) are rare, and often innate (with exceptions - the eight son of an eight son must become a wizard, even if the son is a daughter), and do require some form of training (again, with exceptions - see ''[[Sourcery]]''). Also, magical practicioners on the Disc treat the use of magic not unlike the use of nuclear weaponry - it's okay for people to know that you have it, but ''everyone'' will be in trouble if it gets used.

==Education==
[[Image:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|right|thumb|"The Alchemist" by [[William Fettes Douglas]]:  studying for arcane knowledge]]

A common trait of magicians is that, no matter how spontaneously their abilities manifest, they must learn to use them.  Occasionally these terms are used for people with innate abilities, but the typical magician is surrounded by books in his tower owing to his studies.  Fictionally, it provides a way for the writer to ensure that his wizard characters can not do everything, thus eliminating conflict from the story.<ref name="kern">Michael Kern, "[http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/kern14.html The Limits of Magic]"</ref>

When the magician is not the main character, this may not be visible, but magician protagonists from [[Ursula K. LeGuin]]'s Ged in ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' to [[Harry Potter]] have gone to wizardry schools.  Others have taken on the roles of apprentices.

Another means of learning can be books -- weighty, ancient tomes, often called [[grimoire]]s.  [[Conan the Barbarian]]'s sorcerer foes often gained powers from such books, whose strangeness was often underscored by their strange bindings.  In worlds where wizardry is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a factor; in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'', Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician [[Prospero]] to learn magic.

It may be impossible, in a given work, to determine whether a given practice of magic is innate, because the length of time needed for the study, the scarcity of the books or teachers, or the preciousness of the materials required mean that most characters are necessarily excluded.

==Magicial materials==
[[Image:John William Waterhouse - Jason and Medea (1907).jpg|right|thumb|"Jason and Medea" by [[John William Waterhouse]]:  brewing a magic potion]]
Historically, many magicians have required rare and precious materials for their spells.  Crystals balls, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and chemicals such as mercury are common.

This is less common in fantasy.  Many magicians require nothing material at all; those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials.  Role-playing games are more likely to require such material for at least some spells, to prevent characters from casting them too easily.

One factor in this development has been the increasing tendencies of wizards to go on quests; the wizard who is merely consulted in his tower may be surrounded by useful equipment and substances, even in a fantasy work, but the questing wizard must carry what he needs.  

[[Wands#Wands in fiction|Wands]] and [[Staff (stick)|staffs]] are a common piece of property, long used in tales involving wizards.<ref>[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 152, ISBN 0-691-01298-9</ref>  [[Gandalf]] refused to surrender his in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and breaking [[Saruman]]'s broke his power.  Magical wands are used from Andre Norton's Witch World to Harry Potter.  One element of this is the need to limit a wizard, so that opposition to him (necessary for a story) is feasible; if the wizard loses his staff or wand (or other magic item on which he is dependant), he is weakened if not magically helpless.<ref name="kern"/>

==Use of magic==
[[Larry Niven]] once urged, in a twist on [[Clarke's three laws|Clarke's third law]], that "any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology," and many other writers have observed that functional magic could replace technology in many situations.

Nevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval setting in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors (especially if they are [[wise old man|wise old men]]), or act as quest companions, or even go on a [[quest]] themselves,<ref name="grant-wizards"/> but their magic does not build roads or buildings, or provide immunizations, or construct indoor plumbing or printing presses, or any of the other functions that it could be put to; their worlds are and remain at a medieval level of technology.<ref>[[David Brin]], "Science versus Magic", p261, ''Otherness'', ISBN 0-553-29528-4</ref>  The magicians themselves often live like [[hermit]]s, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness.  In many, perhaps most, [[high fantasy]] works, this is treated as an intrinsic feature of the world, requiring no explanation.

Sometimes this is justified by the use of magic bringing about worse things than it can alleviate, and the need of wizards to learn restraint<ref>Philip Martin,  ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 8, ISBN 0-87116-195-8</ref> In Barbara Hambley's [[Barbara Hambley#The Windrose Chronicles|Windrose Chronicles]], the wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do.  In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the importance of [[Wizards (Discworld)|wizards]] is that they do not do magic.  This may be direct effect, or the danger of a miscast spell wrecking terrible harm if anything goes work. <ref>Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 142, ISBN 0-87116-195-8</ref>

In other works, developing magic is difficult.  In [[Rick Cook]]'s [[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry series]], the extreme danger of missteps with magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic has stymied magic, and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous elves, until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] -- ours -- to apply the skills he learned here to magic.<ref name="kern"/>

At other times, a parallel development of magic does occur.  This is commonest in [[Alternate history (fiction)#Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre|alternate history]] genre.  Patricia Wrede's [[Patricia Wrede#Regency fantasy|Regency fantasies]] include a Royal Society of Wizards, and a technologica level equivalent to the actual Regency; [[Randall Garrett]]'s [[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]] series, [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Magic, Incorporated'', and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' all depicted modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology.  In [[Harry Potter]], the wizards have magic equivalent or superior to Muggle technology; sometimes they duplicate it, as in the train that brings students to Hogwarts.

==In fantasy role-playing games==
Because of the need for clear adjucation on rules, practitioners of magic in role-playing games are more  clearly defined than in many movies or works of literature.
===Dungeons & Dragons===
====Wizard====
{{main|Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)}}
In the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], the wizard is one of the base [[character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]]. A wizard is an [[Arcane magic (Dungeons & Dragons)|arcane magic]] user, and weak in [[mêlée]] combat. Wizards spend several years studying magic.

The magic system--where wizards memorize spells which they then forget when they cast them--was heavily influenced by the ''[[Dying Earth|The Dying Earth]]'' stories and novels of [[Jack Vance]].

====Other practitioners of magic====
Other types include:
*[[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)]]
*[[Beguiler (Dungeons & Dragons)]]
*[[Shadowcaster (Dungeons & Dragons)]]
*[[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)]]

==Wizards, magicians, and others specific to a work==
