== Technical & Cultural Symposia ==
Every year in February, CEG plays host to [[Techofes]], an eagerly anticipated and keenly contested five-day inter-collegiate cultural festival.

During the months of January and March, various departments of the college conduct individual technical symposia. Notable among these are 
* [http://www.surang2k6.org Surang], , organised by the Department of Mining Engineering,
*Manusys, organised by the Department of Manufacturing Engineering,
* INDCON, organised by the Department of Industrial Engineering,
* Pinnacle conducted by department of Mechanical engineering, 
* [http://www.abacus2k6.org aBacus], conducted by the Department of Computer Science, 
* Vision, conducted by the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, 
* [http://www.seeeofceg.org Waves], of the School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and 
* Civilization, by the Civil Engineering Department

The most popular of the technical symposia are Civilization and [[Colloquium (College of Engineering, Guindy)|Colloquium]] organised by the Department of Mathematics. Civilization of annauniversity attracts the civilengineers from all over India. The Highlight of this is the innovative competition called Rotortreasure survey which tests the surveying capabilities of students.

In other activities also, CEG has earned a reputation worthy of emulation. Teams from CEG often excel in sports and extra curricular activities with participation in national contests like [[University Challenge]]

'''Colloquium''' is the annual technical symposium conducted by the Department of [[Mathematics]] of the college. It aims to collect and disseminate the latest trends in the field of Mathematics through a variety of ways including paper presentations and technical talks by eminent [[Indian mathematicians]] and research scholars.

The highlight of the Colloquium is the Mathematics Quiz, the winner of which is awarded the prestigious Ramanujan Rolling Shield, instituted in the name of the famous Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In recent years, the shield has stayed with teams from the [[College of Engineering, Guindy]] itself. Most notably, a team comprising of Makesh Pravin and Vijay Krishna, both students of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, won the Rolling Shield for three years in succession.

== Rotaract Club of CEG ==
Established in the late 1980s, the [http://www.rotaractceg.co.nr Rotaract Club of CEG] (RCEG) has grown to become one of the largest [[Rotaract]] clubs in Asia. The club, which draws its members from the student body, functions independently, but under the guidance of the Deans and the parent Rotaract club. RCEG in involved in a lot of community service initiatives and raises funds through charity shows and individual contributions. The club has started its official blog recently, and it can be found [http://rotaractceg.blogspot.com here].
