==Biography==
===Early life===
Douglas Alexander Warner III was born on June 9, [[1946]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] as the eldest son to Douglas Alexander Warner Jr. and Eleanor (Wright) W. Warner. <ref>[[Marquis Who's Who | Marquis Who's Who in America.]]  2000.  ''[http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/ Warner, Douglas Alexander , III.]''</ref>  Warner came from money, growing up in the high-toned suburb of [[Indian Hill, Ohio | Indian Hills]] in a family with a certain social standing locally.  For example, Warner's father served as a trustee of the [[Music Hall (Cincinnati) | Cincinnati Music Hall Association]] and [[Cincinnati Art Museum | Art Museum]] and chaired the United Appeal one year.  Warner's grandfather (and namesake) ran his own insurance firm and was active in local golfing circles.  Grandmother Warner was the daughter of a wealthy Cincinnati [[entrepreneur]] named [[J. Stacey Hill]], who was the president of a then- prominent thousand room Cincinnati hotel named [[Hotel Gibson]].<ref>Teitelman, Robert.  (March 1996).

In [[1960]] at the tender age of 14, Warner's family shipped Warner a thousand miles away from his home in Ohio to [[The Hill School]] - an American boarding school for boys and girls in grades nine through twelve in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]].  The Hill School is the same school Warner's father graduated from in [[1937]]. <ref> The Hill School - private college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.

===Education and career===
From The Hill School, Warner applied to [[Yale University]].  Coming from a wealthy family and a prestigious boarding school and having [[genes]] that give stature merely from being tall, Warner additionally had another unearned advantage over other Yale applicants as Yale was the same school attended by Warner's father and uncle. <ref>Teitelman, Robert.  (March 1996).  [[Institutional Investor magazine | Institutional Investor.]]  ''[http://www.e-ii.com/pdfarchive/11484/iinews-dom-1996-C15FC4E1-4779mar.pdf Morgan enters the Warner era.  (J.P.

(Note: This article has a most in-depth information on Warner.)</ref>  In [[1964]], Warner enter [[Yale University]] at the age of 18 as a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student. <ref>Moyer, Liz.

Pg. 2</ref>  At age 18, Warner was of [[Conscription_in_the_United_States#Vietnam_War | draft age]] but most likely held a 2-S (college deferment) [[Selective Service System | Selective Service System classification]] as a student at Yale University.  During his time at Yale, Warner became friends with the future [[George W. Bush | President George W. Bush]] through then-Yale ice hockey player [[Roland W. Betts]] - now owner of the multimillion dollar [[Chelsea Piers |Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex.]]<ref>Blackwell, Rob.  (Jan. 3, 2001).  [[American Banker | American Banker (USA)]].

D2.</ref>  This friendship would prove valuable as President Bush later named Warner as a financial adviser to [[President-elect]] Bush's transition team in [[2000]].<ref> Blackwell, Rob.

At the peak of the [[Vietnam war]] upheaval in the United States in May [[1968]], Warner graduated from [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) degree and intended to go to [[Yale medical school]] after leaving Yale undergraduate.  Without a college deferment, Warner most likely would have been classified as [[Selective_Service_System#Classifications | 1-A]], that is to say, classified as available immediately for military service.  For example, [[George W. Bush | President Bush]] was classified as 1-A on Bush's graduation from Yale in May 1968 and was accepted into the [[Texas Air National Guard]] at the height of the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].  

With the Vietnam war and Yale medical school choices facing Warner, Warner looked to a third option based on advice from his father, an insurance man from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  Warner's father advised Warner to go into business to develop some "breadth"<ref>Leaders - financial - sandy Warner.  (19 April 2000),  [http://www.justpeople.com/ContentNew/People/Leaders/leaderdb/SandyWarner.asp Douglas 'Sandy' Warner III.]</ref> and subsequently Warner entered the management training program at [[Morgan Guaranty Trust Company]] in [[New York City]].<ref>Yale University.

Morgan Chase & Co.]] (formerly [[J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. | J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated]]).  Over the next seven years, Warner rapidly advanced from officer's assistant (1968-1970), through assistant treasurer (1970-1972) and assistant Vice President (1972-1975), to Vice President in [[1975]]. <ref>[[Marquis Who's Who | Marquis Who's Who in America.]]  2000.

== Business legacy ==
Analysts say that Mr. Warner was a key figure throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the transformation of J.P. Morgan from a commercial bank to an investment banking firm.  For example, J.P. Morgan was the first commercial bank since the 1930s to be granted the power to [[Underwriting | underwrite]] [[Secured debt | debt]] and [[equity securities]].  Under Warner, the firm ended lifelong job security as a result of a 1998 restructuring. One of his biggest cultural marks on J.P. Morgan was the creation of the "House Arrest" group, a dozen or so senior executives who met monthly to discuss management issues. <ref>Moyer, Liz.
