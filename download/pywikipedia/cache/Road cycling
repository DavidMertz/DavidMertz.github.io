'''Road cycling''' is the most widespread and popular form of [[bicycle]] riding. It is done on paved surfaces. It is the main form of utility cycling. Cyclists who act like vehicle drivers when traveling on roads are often referred to as [[vehicular cycling|vehicular cyclist]]s.

In the context of utility cycling road cycling fulfils various purposes including commuting and also general transport for work e.g. [[bicycle messenger]]ing and leisure. There are many types of bikes that are used on the roads, from [[BMX]] bikes through to high end [[road bike]]s. 

Bikes are usually made from one of four different materials (or a combination of two or more of these materials). These are [[steel]], [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], and [[carbon fiber]]. Throughout the world the most commonly used material is steel as it is relatively cheap, strong and is much easier to repair than the other materials that can be used.
