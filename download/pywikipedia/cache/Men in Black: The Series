'''''Men In Black: The Series''''' (informally '''MIB: The Series''') was an [[animated]] television series that aired on the [[Kids WB]] for four seasons from [[1997]] through [[2001]]. Reruns ran briefly on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s SLAM! block in [[2004]].

The show featured the characters from 1997's [[science fiction]] [[film]] ''[[Men in Black (movie)|Men in Black]]'' Agents Kay and Jay. The show also featured Agent Elle (L) who was formerly known as Dr. Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner. 

MIB: The Series was made by [[Adelaide Productions|Adelaide Productions Inc.]] as a half-hour series airing on Saturday mornings originally and then moving to weekdays.

== Premise ==
MIB: The Series was based on the 1997 blockbuster ''Men In Black'' and continued where the film left off. This was not without some minor changes. Agent Kay remained an agent and partner to Agent Jay. Agent Elle was moved to the lab inside Men In Black Headquarters. The headquarters itself was no longer under the ventilaor building of the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]], but now at what looked like a disused area under LaGuardia airport. These differences are possibly addressed in one episode of the series, where it is revealed that every so often some writer or Hollywood-type learns of the MIB and makes a movie about them. (In the "movie" shown in this episode, the actors playing Kay and Jay much more closely resemble Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.)

The show had varied writing in its episodes. Some episodes were based on the plot to the film, and brought back characters like the Bug, and Arquillian aliens. MIB: The Series itself had a long running plot where the Men In Black fought Alpha, a former MIB chief who had turned evil with greed. He returned numerous times and his appearance grew grislier each time with the help of the 'Cosmic Integrator', a device that let him combine alien appendages to his own body. 

Some plots, like the plots with Alpha were sometimes more serious, while others were more whimsical in nature. This included a Halloween episode with alien phantoms on another plane of existence, and a holiday episode where criminal Drekk kidnapped Santa Claus (the elves were really aliens). 

Ultimately, the basic plot was for the MIB to protect the Earth from harm, and this extended into keeping galactic peace throughout the galaxy. Technology, as well as intergalactic politics and peacekeeping were a focus, along with common criminal activity on a science fiction level.
