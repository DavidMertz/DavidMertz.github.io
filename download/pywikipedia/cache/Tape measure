A '''tape measure''' or '''measuring tape''' is a ribbon of cloth, plastic, or metal with
linear-measure markings, often in both [[imperial unit|imperial]] and [[SI|metric units]]. [[Surveyor]]s use tape measures in lengths on the order of [[hectometre]]s. It is a convenient measuring tool. Its flexibility allows for a measure of great length to be easily carried in pocket or toolkit and permits one to measure around curves or corners.

Tape measures intended for use in [[sewing|tailoring]] or dressmaking are typically made of flexible cloth or plastic, while those designed for [[carpenter|carpentry]] or [[construction]] often use a stiff, curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended, but retracts into a coil for convenient storage. This type of tape measure will have a floating tang on the end to aid measuring. The tang will float a distance equal to its thickness, to allow accurate measurement whether the tape is in tension or compression. A tape measure of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container.

For many purposes tape measures are indispensable. Almost any home or shop can be expected to have several of one sort or another.

Metal tape measures, usually [[Stanley Works]] brand, are also convenient for use as directional antennas for both robotic and satellite communications because of their parabolic shape, low cost, and simple conversion into motorized extensible and retractable format.

The design on which most modern spring tape measures are built on was [[patent]]ed by [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] resident Alvin J. Fellows on [[14 July]], 1868. According to the text of his patent, Alvin's tape measure was only an improvement on other versions priorly designed.<ref>Letters Patent No. 79,965.
