The '''Shebaa Farms''' ({{lang-ar|[[مزارع شبعا]]}}, ''{{ArabDIN|[[Mazāri‘ Šib‘ā]]}}''; {{lang-he|[[חוות שבעא]]}}, ''[[Havot Sheba'a]]'') is a small area of disputed ownership located at the junction of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Israel]]. The area is located between the Lebanese village of Shebaa on the northwestern slopes of [[Mount Hermon]], the [[Druze]] village of [[Majdal Shams]] on the slopes of the [[Golan Heights]] (about 7 [[kilometers]] (4&nbsp;[[mile]]s) away), and Israeli towns and settlements that it overlooks below, such as [[Qiryat Shemona]]. 
 
The area is 14 km (9&nbsp;miles) in length, and averages 2.5 km (2&nbsp;miles) in width, coming to about 25 square km (10 square miles).  Altitudes range from 150 to 1,880 [[meter]]s (490&ndash;6,170&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|feet]]).  

==Summary of the current dispute==
The area referred to as 'Shebaa Farms' was captured by [[Israel]] from Syria during the [[Six Day War]] in [[1967]], which did not involve Lebanon.  Israel considers the Shebaa Farms to be part of the Golan Heights,<ref> {{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/about%20the%20ministry/mfa%20spokesman/2002/the%20legal%20status%20of%20the%20shabaa%20farms%20-%208-apr-2002|

The controversy over the Farms first arose in [[2000]], as the [[United Nations]] certified that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon was complete.  Israel's annexation of the Shebaa Farms has been contested by [[Hezbollah]] (since May 2000), and advanced as a reason for its continued attacks on Israel after Israel's [[Liberation Day (Lebanon)|unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon]].  On a fact-finding visit to the region [[Terje Rød-Larsen]], the UN special envoy to the Middle East, cast doubt on the validity of the assertion that the Shebaa Farms were Lebanese territory seized by Israel during the 1967 war, pointing out that Lebanon was not a party to the 1967 war and that the 1923 Anglo-French demarcation and the 1949 Armistice line clearly designated the area as Syrian territory.<ref name="meib-vol3nr5hezb">{{cite journal | last=Gambill | first=Gary C | title=Syria and the Shebaa Farms Dispute | journal=[[Middle East Forum|Middle East Intelligence Bulletin]] | date=May 2001 | issue=Vol. 3, No. 5 | url=http://www.meib.org/articles/0105_l1.htm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

Members of the international diplomatic community have repeatedly requested that Syria and Lebanon take steps to determine the exact boundary between them in the Shebaa Farms region and elsewhere, including officially registering the demarcated border with the United Nations. President Assad of Syria has refused, however, to do so until Israeli troops withdraw.

==Background (1923-2000)==
===The French Mandate through the Six Day War (1923–67)===
The dispute over the sovereignty of the Shebaa Farms resulted in part from the failure of the French [[Mandate]] administrations, and subsequently the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to properly [[demarcate]] the border between Lebanon and Syria, though there is a long history of the area having been designated as Syrian by France, Lebanon, and Syria from [[1923]] onward.  

In the [[1923]] Anglo-French [[Demarcation]] Agreement, which set the borders between the British and French mandates in [[Palestine]], Syria, and Lebanon, the area was included in Syria.<ref name="UN-S-2000-460">{{cite web | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/97bad2289146f58a852568e9006d99bd!OpenDocument |  title=Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) | date=[[2000-05-22]] | publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]]| accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref> 

Documents from the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] indicate that some local inhabitants, however, regarded themselves as part of Lebanon, for example paying taxes to the Lebanese government.  But French officials at times expressed confusion as to the actual location of the border.<ref name="Kaufman-pij">{{cite journal | title=Understanding the Sheeba Farms dispute | url=http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=9 | first=Asher | last=Kaufman | journal=Palestine-Israel Journal | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=2004 | accessdate=2006-07-22}}</ref> One French official in [[1939]] expressed the belief that the uncertainty was sure to cause trouble in the future. 

The region continued to be represented in the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]] as Syrian territory, under the French Mandate.  Detailed maps showing the border were produced by the French in [[1933]], and again in [[1945]].<ref>"[[Beyrouth]]" 1:200,000 sheet NI36-XII available in the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] and French archives.</ref> They clearly showed the region to be in Syria.  

Following France's exit from the region, the land was administered by Syria, and represented as such in all maps of the time.<ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590">{{cite journal | title=Who owns the Shebaa Farms? Chronicle of a territorial dispute | first=Asher | last=Kaufman | journal=[[Middle East Journal]] | publisher=[[Middle East Institute]] | volume=56 | issue=4 | date=Autumn 2002 | pages=576–596}}</ref> 
But a commission responsible for demarcating the border in the decades after the French Mandate ended in [[1946]] did not act decisively to delimit or demarcate the area.  

The maps of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Syria and Israel also designated the area as Syrian. 

Border disputes arose at times, however.  Shebaa Farms was not unique; several other border villages had similar discrepancies of borders versus land ownership.  Syria and Lebanon formed a joint Syrian-Lebanese border committee in the late [[1950s]] to determine a proper border between the two nations.  In [[1964]], concluding its work, the committee suggested to the two governments that the area be deemed the property of Lebanon, and recommended that the international border be reestablished consistent with its suggestion.  However, neither Syria nor Lebanon adopted the committee's suggestion, and neither country took any action along the suggested lines.  Thus, maps of the area continued to reflect the Farms as being in Syria.<ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/>  Even maps of both the Syrian and Lebanese armies continued to demarcate the region within Syrian territory.<ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/> 

[[Image:Shebaafarms.png|thumb|250px|right|A Lebanese military map, published in 1966, showing the Shebaa Farms as being on the Syrian side of the border.]]
A number of local residents regarded themselves as Lebanese, however.  The Lebanese government showed little interest in their views.  The Syrian government administered the region, and on the eve of the [[1967]] war, the region was under effective Syrian control.

In [[1967]] most Shebaa Farms landowners and farmers (Lebanese) lived outside the Syrian-controlled region, across the Lebanon-Syrian border, in the Lebanese village of Shebaa.  During the [[Six Day War]], [[Israel]] captured the Farms from [[Syria]].  After Syria lost the land (to the Israelis) in 1967, the Lebanese landowners were no longer able to farm it.<ref name=modelUN>{{cite paper | title=Shebaa Farms | url=http://www.munuc.org/pdfs/SC_B.pdf | author=Model United Nations of the University of Chicago | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=The key to Shebaa | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/717FD283-592E-44BA-8A22-9D46B441C304.htm | date=25 April 2005 | last=Nasser | first=Cilina | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>

===UN Resolution 242 (1967)===

In 1967, following the termination of the [[Six Day War]], the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242 (1967)]],<ref>{{cite web | date=[[1967-11-22]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/7d35e1f729df491c85256ee700686136!OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> later reaffirmed by [[UN Security Council Resolution 338]] (1973),<ref>{{cite web | date=[[1973-10-22]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Resolution 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/7fb7c26fcbe80a31852560c50065f878!OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> calling for all four of the following: 
#The "withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict." Some dispute whether the language requires withdrawal from "all" occupied territories.  The drafting process was in English, and the version of the text that was voted on was the English text.  The UN practice is that the binding version of any resolution is the one voted upon.   (See statement by [[Arthur Goldberg]], US [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] at that time, and an author of the Resolution:  "The notable omissions in regard to withdrawal... are the words 'all,' 'the' and 'the June 5, 1967 lines'... There is lacking a declaration requiring Israel to withdraw from all of the territories occupied by it on, and after, June 5, 1967... On certain aspects, the Resolution is less ambiguous than its withdrawal language. Resolution 242 (1967) specifically calls for termination of all claims or states of belligerency..."  ([[Columbia Law School|Columbia]] Journal of [[International Law]], Vol. 12, no. 2, 1973)).  Still, an innacurate translation in the French text, which was supposed to be a translation of the authoritative English text, has spawned some contoversy.  The French text uses "des territoires occupés," meaning "from '''the''' occupied territories."  The authoritative English text deliberately omits "'''the'''."  In any event, the UN regards Shebaa Farms as Syrian territory occupied by Israel, not Lebanese territory subject to Resolution 242.
#The recognition by Israel, [[Egypt]], Syria, and [[Jordan]] of each other.
#The termination of all claims or states of belligerency. 
#The establishment of defensible boundaries for all parties.

All of the involved states, arguably, have failed to satisfy one or more of the four cornerstones of the resolution. 

In [[1981]], the area was officially [[annexed]] by Israel, as part of the Golan Heights.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bard | first=Mitchell G | authorlink=Mitchell Bard | title=Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict | publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]] | id=ISBN 0-9712945-4-2 | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths2/myths2006.pdf | format=PDF | edition=3rd edition | date=[[2006-03-13]]}}</ref> This unilateral annexation is not recognised by the UN or international community.

===Coastal Road massacre, Operation Litani, and UN Resolution 425 (1978–2000)===

From [[1968]], the [[PLO|Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)]] established a quasi-state in [[southern Lebanon]].  On [[March 11]], [[1978]], [[PLO]] members infiltrated Israel from Lebanon, and killed 37 Israeli civilians riding in a bus in the [[Tel Aviv]] area, as well as an American nature photographer on an Israeli beach.  In addition, they injured 76 Israelis.  See [[Coastal Road massacre]].  The attack was the most deadly in a [[Operation Litani #Background|string of attacks]] that the PLO had launched from Lebanon.  It triggered Israel's [[Operation Litani]] against PLO bases in southern Lebanon three days later. 

Five days after Operation Litani began, [[UN Security Council Resolution 425|UN Security Council Resolution 425 (1978)]] called upon Israel to:  "withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory."  The phrase "all territory" was used in Resolution 425, contrasting with the language in Resolution 242 (1967).  

On [[May 22]], [[2000]], [[Israel]] completed its withdrawal from the southern Lebanon in accordance with [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]].<ref>{{cite web | date=[[1978-03-19]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978 | url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/e25dae8e3ce54fb5852560e50079c708!OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> The UN certified the completion of Israel's pullout.<ref name="SC/6878">{{cite web | date=[[2000-06-18]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Security council endorses secretary-genereal's conclusion on Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as of 16 June | url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

==The current dispute==
===Lebanon's claim ===
The disputed territory was not mentioned by the Lebanese government after the [[1967 Six Day War]], or the [[1973 October War]], as an occupation issue.  

In [[2000]], in what appears to be the Lebanese government's first claim to the territory, Lebanon disputed Israel's compliance with UN Resolution 425 (1978).  Lebanon claimed that the Shebaa Farms area was actually Lebanese, and demanded that the Israelis should therefore withdraw from there as well.  Lebanon asserted that the UN certification of the Israeli withdrawal was "invalid," because of Lebanon's claim to the Farms.<ref name=UNreport2>{{cite paper | title=Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) | url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/b86613e7d92097880525672e007227a7/736411af9bc6369585256903004f90c1!OpenDocument | publisher=United Nations | date=16 June 2000 | author=United Nations Secretary-General | version=S/2000/590 | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> 

Lebanese officials point to land [[deed]]s, stamped by the Lebanese government, that were held by a number of area residents in the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]].  

The new Lebanese claim to this area is one reason now asserted by [[Hezbollah]] for its continuing conflict with [[Israel]], and its cross-border attacks after the Israeli withdrawal.<ref>{{cite news | title=Shebaa farmers view Hezbollah as their savior | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/cgi-bin/review/article_full_story.asp?service_id=1128 | date=[[2006-05-27]] | publisher=[[aljazeera.com]] | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> However, Hezbollah's spokesperson Hassan Ezzedin had this to say about the Farms:  "If they go from Sheba'a, we will not stop fighting them. Our goal is to liberate the [[1948]] borders of [[Palestine]]...[post-1948 immigrant Jews] can go back to [[Germany]] or wherever they came from.”<ref name=NewYorker>{{cite journal | title=Are terrorists in Lebanon preparing for a larger war? | issue=[[2002-10-14]] | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/021014fa_fact4 | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=[[2002-10-07]] | authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg | first=Jeffrey | last=Goldberg | accessdate=2006-08-16 }}</ref> 

Lebanese opposition leader [[Walid Jumblatt]] has stated that Lebanon has no valid claim to the Sheba farms area.<ref>{{cite news | last=Waked | first=All | title=Lebanese leader: Mount Dov not ours | publisher=[[Ynetnews]] | date=[[2005-03-15]] | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3058858,00.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

On [[28 August]] [[2006]], Hezbollah fighters withdrew from positions facing Israeli lines in the Shebaa Farms area.<ref>{{cite news | last=Wright | first=Jonathan | title=News analysis: Hezbollah seen surviving UN troop expansion | publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] | date=[[2006-08-29]] | url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=9b36735b-00f8-4035-a43c-bf90c0c017e5&k=58702 | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

====Lebanese media reaction ====

A Lebanese newspaper, however, described the land deed of one Shebaa resident as "handwritten and signed on a yellowing piece of paper in pencil and ink."  Moreover, it is quite common for Lebanese to own land in Syria, and vice versa.<ref name="meib-vol3nr5hezb"/>

According to an Arab newspaper, ''Al-Hayat,'' most Lebanese, in fact, had never heard or read about the Farms, even in their national school curricula.<ref>{{cite news | last=Haydar | first=Hassan | title=Persian Borders | publisher=[http://english.daralhayat.com/ Dar Al Hayat] | date=[[2006-08-10]] | url=http://english.daralhayat.com/opinion/OPED/08-2006/Article-20060810-f83791fe-c0a8-10ed-019d-d97b35ff3b0b/story.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> "The issue over these farms was created to justify resistance operations from Lebanon after the UN had created the Blue Line following Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. The Shebaa farms were placed inside Syrian territory. It should be noted that Syria, which claims that the farms are Lebanese, has not presented a single document to the UN to prove it. More than that, Syria refuses to demarcate its borders with Lebanon."<ref>{{cite news | last=Dergham | first=Raghida | title=Only Constructive Negotiations Can Bring about a Ceasefire | publisher=[http://english.daralhayat.com/ Dar Al Hayat] | date=[[2006-07-28]] | url=http://english.daralhayat.com/opinion/OPED/07-2006/Article-20060728-b49960a1-c0a8-10ed-01ce-4de8b0ca56ad/story.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

The [[BBC]] news website quoted Timur Goskel, spokesman for the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]], as saying that the farms were in an area of undefined sovereignty, but that "on all maps the UN has been able to find, the farms are seen on the Syrian side".<ref>{{cite news | title=In focus: Shebaa farms | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=[[2000-05-25]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/763504.stm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

===Syrian position===

Syria has at times supported Lebanon's claim that the Shebaa Farms are part of Lebanon and not Syrian territory at the UN and in official government press releases.  But at times it has made contrary statements.

In August [[1972]], Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] said, "Syria and Lebanon are a single country."<ref name="rubinm781">{{cite web| url=http://www.meforum.org/article/781 | accessdate=2006-08-11 | title=Lebanon's Tenuous Transformation | publisher=Middle East Form | last=Rubin| first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Rubin (historian)}}</ref> Syria does not maintain an [[embassy]] in Beirut, which would indicate recognition of Lebanese independence.<ref name="rubinm781"/> Similarly, a professor of political science at the [[Hebrew University]], [[Daniel Pipes]] (Editor of [[Middle East Quarterly]]),<ref name="rubinm781"/> and others have written about Syria's failure to establish [[diplomatic relations]] with Lebanon.  In addition, Lebanon does not appear as an [[independent state]] in maps in Syrian textbooks, but rather as part of [[Greater Syria]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.middleeastinfo.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=10404| last=Rabinovich| first=Abraham | authorlink=Abraham Rabinovich | accessdate=2006-08-11 |title=Disputed farms suggested as key to peace |publisher=The Washington Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Jews, Zionism and Israel in Syrian Textbooks | publisher=[http://www.edume.org/ Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace] | chapter=Chapter V: The portrayal of Israel and Israelis | chapterurl=http://www.edume.org/reports/6/5.htm | url=http://www.edume.org/reports/6/toc.htm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Pipes | first=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Pipes | title=Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition | publisher=Oxford University Press | chapter=Introduction: A Neglected Topic |id=ISBN 0195060229 | origdate=[[1992-05-26]] | chapterurl=http://www.danielpipes.org/books/greaterchap.php | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Rabinovich | first=Abraham | title=Seeds of peace in ceding farms | publisher=[[The Australian]] | date=[[2006-07-29]] | url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19947343-2703,00.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Rabinovich | first=Abraham | title=Disputed farms suggested as key to peace | publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=[[2006-07-31]] | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20060730-110033-2439r.htm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Stahl | first=Julie | title='Real American Pressure' Still Needed on Damascus | publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]] | date=[[2005-02-25]] | url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=/ForeignBureaus/archive/200502/FOR20050225b.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Butcher | first=Tim | title=People power brings down Lebanese government | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=[[2005-03-01]] | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/03/01/wleb01.xml | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> 

The Shebaa Farms also appear as part of Syria on the large-scale map on the Syrian Ministry of Tourism's website.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.syriatourism.org/servers/gallery/syria_big_263.jpg| accessdate=2006-08-09| title=Syrian Ministry of Tourism's Map of Syria}}</ref>

In [[2002]] [[Israeli]] officials noted that Syria treated the area as its own over the years. They pointed to the fact, for example, that a Syrian census in [[1960]] included the residents of the Farms.  

On [[May 16]], [[2000]], the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Shara, indicated to Annan in a telephone conversation that Syria supported Lebanon's claim.<ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/> This was made public in the UN Press Release SC/6878 of 18 June 2000 which stated 'Concerning the Shab'a farmlands, both Lebanon and Syria state that this land belongs to Lebanon.'<ref name="SC/6878"/> 

Support for the Lebanese claim was reiterated in January 21, [[2006]], by the President of Syria in a speech before the convention of the Arab Lawyers Union in [[Damascus]] and translated into English  by SANA, the official state news agency of Syria.  President [[Bashar al-Assad]] stated that there are two legal requirements for demarcating the border: first, the complaint must be registered with the UN; and second, engineers must precisely define the border.  As neither Syria nor Lebanon have access to the area, Assad argues that resolution is waiting on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territory.<ref>{{cite web | last=al-Assad | first=Bashar | authorlink=Bashar al-Assad | title=President Bashar Assad's speech before the annual convention of the Arab Lawyers Union, Damascus | publisher=[http://www.cggl.org/ Campaign for Good Governance in Lebanon] | date=[[2006-01-21]] | url=http://www.cggl.org/scripts/document.asp?id=46253 | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> Nevertheless, so far Israel has not idicated that it would refuse to allow an official Lebanese, Syrian or international contingent to enter the Shebaa Farms territory in order to demarcate the border, were an official request to do so be made at some point.

On August 15, [[2006]], however, Syria said it would not object to the deployment in Shabaa of [[UNIFIL]] soldiers, but would not allow the Lebanese Army to patrol or set up positions there. {{citeneeded}}

In an interview with Assad reported by SANA on August 24, 2006, Assad flatly refused demarcation of the Syrian/Lebanese border near Shebaa Farms before a withdrawal of Israeli troops.<ref>{{cite news | title=President Bashar al-Assad Gives an interview to Dubai Satellite TV.

===UN position=== 

The United Nations agreed with Israel that the area is not covered by [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]], which governed the withdrawal from Lebanon, inasmuch as the Farms are not Lebanese territory, and the UN certified Israel's pullout.<ref name="SC/6878"/> At the same time the UN noted that its decision was "without prejudice to future border agreements between the Member States concerned," referring to Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.

The UN stated:
"On [[15 May]] [[2000]], the United Nations received a map, dated 1966, from the Government of Lebanon which reflected the Government's position that these farmlands were located in Lebanon. However, the United Nations is in possession of 10 other maps issued after 1966 by various Lebanese government institutions, including the Ministry of Defense and the army, all of which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic. The United Nations has also examined six maps issued by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, including three maps since 1966, which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic."<ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/>

In a [[June 18]], [[2000]] statement, the [[Security Council]] noted that Israel and Lebanon had confirmed to the Secretary General, that identification of the withdrawal line was solely the responsibility of the UN and that both sides would respect the line as identified. Moreover, the Security Council took note, "with serious concern," of reports of violations - by [[Hezbollah]]<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2000-06-18]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Statement by the President of the Security Council | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/fccb334ac2e1ac6c8525690b0063667e!OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> - that had occurred since June 16, 2000, and called upon the parties to respect the line drawn by the United Nations.

UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], in remarks to the press with U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], Foreign Minister of [[Spain]] Josep [[Pique]], Foreign Minister of Russia [[Igor Ivanov]], and [[European Union]] Senior Official [[Javier Solana]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], on [[April 10]], [[2002]], said:  "With reference to the disturbances along the Blue Line emanating from Lebanese territory, I call on the Government of Lebanon and all relevant parties to condemn and prevent such violations. The Security Council itself confirmed in June 2000 that Israel had withdrawn from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions 425 and 426. Attacks at any point along the Blue Line, including in the Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights, are violations of Security Council resolutions. Respect for decisions of the Security Council is the most basic requirement of international legitimacy."

More recently, the [[January 20]], [[2005]] UN Secretary-General's report on Lebanon stated rather emphatically: "The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the Shab'a farms area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions.  The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978).  The Government of Lebanon should heed the Council’s repeated calls for the parties to respect the Blue Line in its entirety."<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2005-01-28]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Security Council condemns violence along blue line between Israel and Lebanon, extends mandate of UNIFIL until 31 July | url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8299.doc.htm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> Timur Goksel, a spokesman for the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] ([[UNIFIL]]) told the [[BBC]] that: "on all maps the UN has been able to find, the farms are seen on the Syrian side [of the border]."<ref>BBC News (London), [[2000-05-25]].</ref>

On [[May 19]], [[2005]], an off-the-record discussion with an unnamed senior diplomat from an unidentified country at the [[Washington DC]]-based [[Brookings Institution]] luncheon reported that: "in drawing the 'Blue Line' in 2000, the United Nations looked at more than ninety different maps of the region. Only one of them — which was deemed a forgery — showed the Shebaa Farms as Lebanese."<ref>{{cite web | title=Freeing Lebanon | publisher=Saban Center for Middle East Policy | date=[[2005-05-19]] | url=http://www.brookings.edu/fp/saban/events/20050519.htm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

===Israeli position=== 

Israel's position is that the area is not covered by [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]], which governed Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, inasmuch as the Farms were not Lebanese territory.  In support of that view, Israel points to the fact that the UN certified Israel's pullout from Lebanon as having been completed.<ref name="SC/6878"/>  Israel is of the view that the land was Syrian at the time that Israel conquered it during the Six Day War.

===US position===

Along similar lines, [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], the United States [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], said on April 26, 2006: "I think the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence is that Shebaa Farms is Syrian territory."<ref>{{cite interview | last=Bolton | first=John R | subjectlink=John R. Bolton | title=Remarks on UN Reform, Lebanon and Sudan | city=New York | url=http://www.state.gov/p/io/rls/rm/65327.htm | date=2006-04-26}}</ref>

[[Nancy Soderberg]], the former United States [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], made a similar observation on July 21, 2006. She wrote that: "When it was clear the Israelis were going to withdraw fully from Lebanon, Syrian and Lebanese officials fabricated the fiction that this small, sparsely populated area was part of Lebanon. They even produced a crudely fabricated map to back up the dubious claim. I and United Nations officials went into the map room in the United Nations and looked at all the maps of the region in the files for decades. All showed the Shebaa Farms clearly in Syria."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Nancy Soderberg|Soderberg, Nancy]] | title=U.S. must use influence to cool tensions in volatile Middle East | publisher=[[The Florida Times-Union]] | date=[[2006-07-21]] | url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072106/opl_3965102.shtml | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

===Other reactions ===

The [[Arab League]] backed Lebanon's claim with a communique issued at Arab League's 13th session in [[2001]], asking for "complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining occupied Lebanese territory up to the internationally recognized borders, including the Shab`a farmlands".<ref>{{cite web | date=[[2001-04-10]] | publisher=United Nations Security Council | title=Letter dated 6 April 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General | url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/2ee9468747556b2d85256cf60060d2a6/07cd1234c61b141585256a42004e8df2!OpenDocument | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

In [[2002]], a fellow from the [[Harry S. Truman]] Research Instititute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Dr. Asher Kaufman, came across documents in French government [[archives]] while researching the issue.  In one, French litigants in a private dispute, and their arbitrators, entered into a private commercial agreement that suggested that the border should put the Farms in Lebanon.  Two other documents, from [[1937]] and [[1939]], were reports from the administrative councillor of south Lebanon and the head of the Services Speciaux in the Syrian town of [[Quneitra]].  They noted a discrepancy between the border, as determined by the 1:200,000 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] map, and their view of the "reality" in the region.  Collecting "unofficial information" from "various sources," they concluded that in their view the area was Lebanese.  Their conclusion, however, was based on the facts that:  a) some area residents paid taxes to Lebanon; and b) 3 or 4 sheep pens in the Farms belonged to residents of the Lebanese village of Shaba.  After Kaufman published his findings, an editorial in the Lebanese newspaper "the [[Daily Star]]" chided the Lebanese academic community, indicating that it was embarrassing that the discovery had been left to an Israeli researcher.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pearlman | first=Jonathan | title=Long-forgotten papers may offer a new road map for peace | publisher=[[The Age]] | date=[[2006-08-03]] | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/longforgotten-papers-may-offer-a-new-road-map-for-peace/2006/08/02/1154198206054.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

Former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] suggested in the [[Washington Post]] on August 1, 2006, that:  "Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territory, including Shebaa Farms."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Jimmy Carter|Carter, Jimmy]] | title=Stop the Band-Aid Treatment | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=[[2006-08-01]] | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/31/AR2006073100923.html | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

Former Vice President of Syria [[Abdel-Halim Khaddam]], in an interview with the Lebanese [[Future Television]] on [[August 27]], [[2006]], speaking of Syria's most recent comments regarding Shebaa Farms, said: "Saying that the farms are occupied, and hence cannot be demarcated, is nothing but a pretext. The demarcation would not take more than an hour if there was a political will."<ref>{{cite news | title=Khaddam reiterates charge that Damascus killed Hariri | publisher=The Daily Star (Lebanon) | date=[[2006-08-29]] | url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=75088 | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>

[[Israelis]] refer to the area as '''Har Dov''' (''Mount Dov'', ''Bear Mountain'' in [[Hebrew]], named after Captain [[Dov Rodberg]] of the [[IDF]] who was killed there in 1970).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Erlich | first=Reuven | title=Raising the issue of the Sheba’a Farms in the proposed American-French Security Council draft resolution for ending the fighting: background information and significance | publisher=Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies | date=[[2006-08-09]] | url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/sheba_farms_e.pdf | pages=7 | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref>
