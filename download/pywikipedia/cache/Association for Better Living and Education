The '''Association for Better Living and Education''' (ABLE) is "a [[non-profit]], public-benefit organization dedicated to creating a better future for children and communities."<ref>[http://www.able.org ABLE website]</ref> It promotes [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]] doctrine in a semi-secular manner. Located in Hollywood, it was founded in 1988 and acts as an umbrella organization for four Scientology entities: 

*[[Applied Scholastics]], educational programs based on Hubbard's [[Study Tech|study technology]].
*[[Criminon]], a rehabilitation program that brings Hubbard's teachings to prisoners.
*[[Narconon]], controversial drug rehabilitation centers which use Scientology doctrine almost verbatim.
*[[The Way to Happiness]] Foundation, dedicated to disseminating Hubbard's "non-religious moral code", which consists of 21 precepts such as "Don't be promiscuous", "Do not harm a person of good will" and "Respect the religious beliefs of others".

Their main office is located at 7065 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], the former headquarters for the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. [http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/hollywood-ups-and-downs/6981/]

==Criticism==
Although various Scientology groups are registered as legally separate corporations and entities, critics note this has no bearing on whether or not they are controlled by the Church. Studytech.org, a Scientology watchdog site, notes: "Applied Scholastics is indeed a legally separate corporation. However, it has so many ties to the Church of Scientology and its corporate alter ego, the Church of Spiritual Technology, that it cannot be regarded as being anything other than a Scientology subsidiary. [http://studytech.org/asi.php]

Nanette Asimov, reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', in an article critical of ABLE and Narconon, summed it up this way: 
<blockquote>A popular anti-drug program provided free to schools in San Francisco and elsewhere teaches concepts straight out of the Church of Scientology, including medical theories that some addiction experts described as "irresponsible" and "pseudoscience." As a result, students are being introduced to some beliefs and methods of Scientology without their knowledge. ("Scientology link to public schools" by Nanette Asimov, ''San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday, June 9, 2004) </blockquote>
