'''Gaylord Jackson Perry''' (born [[September 15]] [[1938]] in [[Williamston, North Carolina]]) is a former right-handed [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] and a member of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].

Notorious for doctoring baseballs (throwing a [[spitball]]), Perry [[win (baseball)|won]] 314 games over a 22-year career starting in [[1962 in baseball|1962]]. A five-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he was the first pitcher to win the [[Cy Young Award]] in each league, winning it in [[1972 in baseball|1972]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] and in [[1978 in baseball|1978]] with the [[San Diego Padres]]. He is also distinguished, along with his brother [[Jim Perry (baseball)|Jim]], for being the second-winningest brother combination in baseball history--second only to the [[knuckleball]]ing Niekro brothers, [[Phil Niekro|Phil]] and [[Joe Niekro|Joe]]. While pitching for the [[Seattle Mariners]], Perry defeated the [[New York Yankees]] on [[May 6]], [[1982 in baseball|1982]] to become the fifteenth member of the [[300 win club]] for pitchers, but the first since [[Early Wynn]] did it in [[1963 in baseball|1963]]. In [[1983 in baseball|1983]], he became the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime [[strikeout]] king [[Walter Johnson]]'s record of 3,509 strikeouts. [[Steve Carlton]] and [[Nolan Ryan]] were the others.

Despite Perry's notoriety for doctoring baseballs--he even went so far as to title his autobiography ''Me and the Spitter''--(co-authored by Cleveland baseball newspaper writer Bob Sudyk) he wouldn't be ejected for the illegal practice until August 23, 1982, in his 21st season in the majors. Perry also reportedly approached the makers of [[Vaseline]] about endorsing the product and was allegedly rebuffed with a one-line postcard reading, "We soothe babies' backsides, not baseballs."
Like most pitchers, Perry was not renowned for his hitting ability, and in his sophomore season of [[1963 in baseball|1963]], he is said to have joked, "They'll put a man on the moon before I hit a home run."  On [[July 20]] [[1969]], just minutes after the [[Apollo 11]] spacecraft carrying [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed on the moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career.<ref name="moon">[http://www.snopes.com/sports/baseball/perry.htm On the validity of the man on the moon comment]</ref>

Perry retired in 1983 after pitching for eight teams (the [[San Francisco Giants]], Cleveland Indians, [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, [[Atlanta Braves]], Seattle Mariners and [[Kansas City Royals]]).

Despite his admission of illegal pitches, he was elected to the Hall of Fame in [[1991 in baseball|1991]] and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team. In [[1999 in baseball|1999]], ''[[The Sporting News]]'' placed him on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players at number 97.

On [[July 23]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]], the San Francisco Giants retired his uniform number 36.

*At [[Candlestick Park]] on [[September 17]], [[1968 in baseball|1968]], two days after his 30th birthday, Perry, then a Giant, pitched a 1-0 [[no-hitter]] over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Bob Gibson]]. The lone run was on a home run by light-hitting [[Ron Hunt]]â€”only his second of the season. [[Ray Washburn]] returned the favor for the Cardinals against the Giants the very next day with a 2-0 no-hitter of his own.

*Perry was part of a trade where San Diego acquired him from Texas before the 1978 season in exchange for middle reliever [[Dave Tomlin]] and $125,000. The 39-year-old Perry wound up winning the Cy Young Award going 21-6 for San Diego while the 29-year-old Tomlin never pitched for Texas and pitched barely 150 innings the rest of his career.
