'''''Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes''''' (a.k.a. '''''Marvel vs. Capcom 2''''' or '''''MvC2''''') the fourth and final game in the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom series|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series of [[versus fighting game|fighting games]]. With the final installment of the series, [[Capcom]] simplified the engine so that it would be more accessible to casual players, and thus bring in new players, as interest in arcade fighting games had declined.{{verify source}} Changes were made to the air combo system and the button configuration was trimmed down to 4 main buttons and 2 character tag buttons. The game also features 3 on 3 tag, compared to the 2 on 2 tag from previous games in the series. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 was ported to the [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]], [[Xbox]], and [[Playstation 2]].

Marvel vs. Capcom 2 was, at its peak of popularity, perhaps the most successful and ubiquitous arcade fighting game since the early 1990s, when the iconic [[Street Fighter II]] and [[Mortal Kombat]] games were released.

==Story==
When the earth and everything on it begins to die, [[Ruby Heart]] traces the source to an evil being known as [[Abyss (Marvel vs. Capcom 2)|Abyss]]. She summons the greatest heroes to her airship to find the being.  Ultimately, its source of power is revealed to be a mysterious black metal ball within its center.

The ending suggests that the power of Abyss can be given to the person who holds it; Ruby holds it in her hand and regards it briefly before throwing it over her back into the sea. {{verify source}} This is the first ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' game without character-specific endings, as one will get the same end regardless of the characters one uses or how quickly one defeats the final opponent.

==Gameplay==
Players select 3 fighters from either Marvel or Capcom games and fight 1 on 1 until one of the teams have no remaining players.

Each character has at least 1 super combo and the entire team shares a single combo meter.  Once filled, players may attempt super combo and specialized tag combos.

The control scheme consists of 2 punch, 2 kick, and 2 assist buttons.

Much of the gameplay would be considered flawed and unplayable by common competitive standards. However many of the glitches, infinites, and 100% combos by the upper tier of the cast gives the game balance. Some uninitiated players may complain that only around 12 of the 56 characters are tournament worthy and yet most fail to realize that on average most other fighters only have 2-4 characters considered "Tournament Worthy". {{verify source}}

Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has a simple fighting system that even someone who does not have any experience can perform fantastic combos versus the game's [[A.I.]]. Even with this, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has a very steep learning curve, making it an easy game to pick up initially, yet one of the hardest to master. {{fact}}

==Trivia==

*Capcom had originally planned for the Xbox version of the game to have [[Xbox Live]] (online play) capability.  However, Marvel complained that Capcom only held the rights to the game as it was and could not add any new features without purchasing more licensing.  Capcom refused to purchase more licensing from Marvel and Xbox Live was pulled from the game just before it shipped.  Retailers had already begun advertising the game with the Xbox Live logo. <ref>{{cite news

*Although a sequel or upgrade of previous Marvel Comics/Capcom crossovers, Capcom altered their standard "6-Attack" button configuration for MvC2.  With the addition of "3 on 3" fighting, two of the attack buttons used in previous Capcom fighting games were changed to Assist buttons which summoned one of your two teammates, leaving only two punch and two kick attacks. The Medium Punch and Medium Kick can only be used as part of a combo, by pressing the corresponding Light button multiple times.
*The only game in the series to use the [[NAOMI]] system, which is used mostly for 3D games. (Mainly seen in this game in the backgrounds and system effects, as well as Abyss's sphere).
*Because [[Capcom]] is no longer licensed to produce this title (or any joint-[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] productions), the game is no longer in print.  This licensing abnormality, coupled with the resounding and unexpected commercial success of the title, has created an unusually exuberant demand for the game. This phenomenon has in turn culminated in an unprecedentedly resilient and considerable market value, as best evidenced by pricings at Ebay and Amazon. Depending on the home platform, a used copy can go anywhere from $50.00 to over $160.00. {{verify source}}
*During the credits, the voice cast is not revealed. It is rendered as a "SECRET". {{fact}}
*Digging through home versions of the game with hacking tools turns up a few bits hinting that some code is shared between it and [[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]. {{verify source}}
*In the clock tower stage, the clock tower in the back corresponds to the actual console time (i.e. If the Dreamcast console time is set to 3:00 PM, it will show it on the clock tower). {{fact}}
