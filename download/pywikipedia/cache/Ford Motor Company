'''Ford Motor Company''' is an [[United States|American]] [[multinational corporation]] and the world's [[List of automobile manufacturers#World Motor Vehicle Production by Manufacturer|third largest automaker]] based on vehicle sales in [[2005]].  Based in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Metro Detroit]], the automaker was founded by [[Henry Ford]] and incorporated in [[1903]].  Ford now encompasses many global brands, including [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] of the US, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Aston Martin]] and [[Land Rover]] of Great Britain, and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] of Sweden.  Ford also owns a one-third controlling interest in [[Mazda]].  

Ford has also been one of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|ten largest]] corporations by revenue and in [[1999]] ranked as one of the world's most profitable corporations. However, in recent years, it has not fared as well and has not gained market share in North America since [[1995]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Bill Ford: Market share bleed stops now | url = http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/08/news/companies/detroit_taylor_ford/ }}</ref> 

Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce, especially elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving [[assembly line]]s.  [[Henry Ford]]'s combination of highly efficient factories, highly paid workers, and low prices revolutionized manufacturing and came to be known around the world as [[Fordism]] by [[1914]].

==History==
[[Image:Henry ford 1919.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Henry Ford (ca. 1919)]]

===Early development===
Ford was launched from a converted wagon factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors. During its early years, the company produced just a few Alphabet cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue in [[Detroit]]. Groups of two or three men worked on each car from components made to order by other companies. Henry Ford was 40 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, as well as being one of the few to survive the [[Great Depression]]. The largest family-controlled company in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 100 years.

In [[1908]], the Ford Company released the Ford [[Ford Model T|Model T]]. The first Model T's were built at the Piquette Manufacturing Plant. The company moved production to the much larger [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] Plant to keep up with the demand for the Model T. By [[1913]], the company had developed all of the basic techniques of the [[assembly line]] and mass production. Ford introduced the world's first moving assembly line that year, which reduced chassis assembly time from 12Â½ hours in October to 2 hours, 40 minutes. However, these innovations were hard on employees, and turnover of workers was very high.  Turnover meant delays and extra costs of training, and use of slow workers. In January [[1914]], Ford solved the employee turnover problem by doubling pay to $5 a day, cutting shifts from nine hours to an eight hour day for a 5 day work week, and instituting hiring practices that identified the best workers.  Thus, it pioneered the minimum wage and the 40 hour work week in the United States, before the government enacted it. Thus, Henry Ford became an American legend.

Productivity soared and employee turnover plunged, and the cost per vehicle plummeted. Ford cut prices again and again and invented the system of franchised dealers who were loyal to his brand name. Wall Street had disagreed with Ford's generous labor practices when he began paying workers enough to buy the products they made. 

[[Image:AssemblyLine.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Ford assembly line (1913)]]

By the end of 1913, Ford was producing 50 percent of all cars in the [[United States]], and by [[1918]] half of all cars in the country were Model Ts. Henry Ford is reported to have said, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black." This was because black paint was quickest to dry; thus assembly time was cut down.  Earlier models had been available in a variety of colors...

In [[1915]], Henry Ford went on a peace mission to Europe aboard a ship, joining other pacifists in efforts to stop [[World War I]].  This led to an increase in his personal popularity. Ford would subsequently go on to support the war effort with the Model T becoming the underpinnings for allied military vehicles.

===History of the Blue Oval===
The Ford oval trademark was first introduced in 1907. The 1928 Model A was the first vehicle to sport an early version of the Ford script in the oval badge. The dark blue background of the oval is known to designers as Pantone 294C, the same color used in Finland's flag. The Ford script is credited to Childe Harold Wills, Ford's first chief engineer and designer. He created a script in 1903 based on the one he used for his business cards. Today, the oval has evolved into a perfect oval with a width-to-height ratio of 8:3. The current Centennial Oval was introduced on June 17, 2003 as part of the 100th anniversary of Ford Motor Company.<ref>Fall 2006 myFord magazine</ref>

===Post World War I developments===
In [[1919]], [[Edsel Ford]] succeeded his father as president of the company, although Henry Ford still kept a hand in management. Although prices were kept low through highly efficient engineering, the company used an old-fashioned personalized management system, and neglected consumer demand for upscale vehicles. It steadily lost market share to [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], as these and other domestic and foreign competitors began offering fresher automobiles with more innovative features and luxury options.  GM  had a range of models from relatively cheap to luxury, tapping all price points in the spectrum, while less wealthy people purchased used [[Ford Model T|Model T]]s.  The competitors also opened up new markets by extending credit for purchases, so consumers could buy these expensive automobiles with monthly payments. Ford initially resisted that approach, insisting that such debts would ultimately hurt the consumer and the general economy. Ford eventually relented and started offering the same terms in December [[1927]], when Ford unveiled the redesigned [[Ford Model A|Model A]], and retired the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] after producing 15 million of them.

On February 4, 1922 Ford expanded its reach into the luxury auto market through its acquisition of the [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln Motor Company]], named for Abraham Lincoln whom Henry Ford admired, and the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division was established in [[1938]] to serve the mid-price auto market.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ford Motor Company: History | url = http://www.ford.com/en/heritage/history/default.htm }}</ref>.  Ford Motor Company built the largest museum of American History in 1928, The Henry Ford.

Henry Ford would go on to acquire Abraham Lincoln's chair, which he was assainated in, from the owners of the Ford Theatre. [[Washington, D.C.]]  Abraham Lincoln's chair would be displayed along with John F. Kennedy's Lincoln limousine in the Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village in Dearborn, known today as The Henry Ford. John F. Kennedy's Lincoln Limousine was leased to the White House by Ford.

President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] referred to Detroit as the "[[Arsenal of Democracy]]." The Ford Motor Company played a pivotal role in the allied victory during World War I and [[World War II]]. As a pacifist, Henry Ford had expressed that war was a waste of time, Ford did not want to profit from it. Henry Ford was concerned that the Nazis during the 1930's might nationalize his factories in Germany.  During the Great Depression Ford's wages may have seen great to his employees but many of the rules of the factories were very harsh and strict. Those were tense times for American companies doing business in Europe. In the spring of 1939, the Nazis assumed day to day control of Ford factories in Germany. With Europe under siege, Henry Ford's genius would be turned to mass production for the war effort. Specifically, the B-24 Liberator Bomber, still the most produced allied bomber in history,  quickly shifted the balance of power in favor of the allies. The aviation industry could produce, if everything went alright, one Consolidated Aircraft B-24 Bomber a day at an aircraft plant. Ford would show the world how to produce one B-24 an hour at a peak of 600 per month in 24 hour shifts.  Ford's Willow Run factory broke ground in the April of 1941. At the time, it was the largest assembly line in the world, with over 3.5 million sq. ft.  Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's son, under severe stress of running the B-24 bomber facility, died in the Spring of 1943 of stomach cancer prompting his grieving father Henry Ford to re-assume day-to-day control of the Ford Motor Company.  Mass production of the B-24 began by August of 1943. Many pilots slept on cots waiting for takeoff as the B-24 rolled off the assembly line at Ford's Willow Run facility.<ref>{{cite web | last = Nolan | first = Jenny | title = Willow Run and the Arsenal of Democracy | publisher = The Detroit News | url = http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=73&category=locations Willow Run and the Arsenal of Democracy }}</ref>


===Post World War II developments===

At the behest of [[Edsel Ford]]'s widow Eleanor and Henry's wife Clara, [[Henry Ford]] would make his oldest grandson, [[Henry Ford II]], President of Ford Motor Company.
[[Image:Ford Taurus (2005) (photograph by Theo, 2006).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Ford Taurus]], one of Ford's best-selling models. In its 21 year lifespan, it sold 7,000,000 units. It is the 4th best selling car in Ford's history, behind only the [[Ford F-150|F-150]], the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], and the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]].]]
[[Henry Ford II]] served as President from 1945â1960, and as Chairman and CEO from 1960â1980.  "Hank the Deuce" led Ford to become a [[publicly traded]] [[corporation]] in 1956. However, the Ford family maintains about 40 percent controlling interest in the company, through a series of Special Class B [[preferred stock]]s.

In 1947, Henry Ford died. According to A&E Biography, an estimated 7 million people mourned his death.

Ernest Breech was hired in 1946 and became Executive Vice President.  He later in 1955 became Board Chairman.

In 1946 [[Robert McNamara]] joined Ford Motor Company as manager of planning and financial analysis. He advanced rapidly through a series of top-level management positions to the presidency of Ford on [[9 November]] [[1960]], one day after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1960|election]].  The first company head selected outside the Ford family, McNamara had gained the favor of Henry Ford II, and had aided in Ford's expansion and success in the postwar period. Less than five weeks after becoming president at Ford, he accepted Kennedy's invitation to join his [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]], as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].

In the 1950s, Ford introduced the iconic [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] in 1955 and the [[Edsel]] brand automobile line in 1958. Edsel was cancelled after less than 27 months in the marketplace in November 1960. The corporation bounced back from the failure of the Edsel by introducing its compact [[Ford Falcon]] in 1960 and the [[Ford Mustang| Mustang]] in 1964. By 1967, Ford of Europe was established.  

[[Lee Iacocca]] was involved with the design of several successful Ford automobiles, most notably the Ford Mustang. He was also the "moving force," as one court put it, behind the notorious [[Ford Pinto]]. He promoted other ideas which did not reach the marketplace as Ford products. Eventually, he became the president of the Ford Motor Company, but he clashed with Henry Ford II and ultimately, on July 13, 1978, he was famously fired by Henry II, despite Ford posting a $2.2 billion dollar profit for the year.  In 1979 Phil Caldwell became Chairman, succeeded in 1985 by Don Petersen

[[Harold Arthur Poling|Harold Poling]] served as Chairman and CEO from 1990-1993. [[Alexander Trotman, Baron Trotman|Alex Trotman]] was Chairman and CEO from 1993-1998, and [[Jacques Nasser]] served at the helm from 1999-2001. Henry Ford's great-grandson, [[William Clay Ford Jr.]], is the company's current Chairman of the Board and was CEO until [[September 5]], [[2006]], when he named [[Alan Mulally]] from [[Boeing]] as his successor. [[As of 2006]], the Ford family owns about 5 percent of Ford's shares and controls about 40 percent of the voting power through a separate class of stock.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Ford considers going private-USA Today | publisher = Reuters | date = August 24, 2006 | url = http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?view=CN&storyID=2006-08-24T163201Z_01_N24426530_RTRIDST_0_AUTOS-FORD.XML&rpc=66&type=qcna }}</ref>

In November 2006, Ford announced that it would mortgage all its assets including factories, equipment, office property, intellectual property (patents and trademark), and stakes in subsidiaries to raise $18 billion in an effort to overhaul itself. The amount to be raised exceeded Fords market value at that time by $2 billion, and the action was unprecedented in the companies 103 year history. <ref name="fordmortgage"> N.

==New directions for the twenty-first century==
In 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay (Bill) Ford, the Company stunned the industry (and pleased environmentalists) with an
[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=105&STORY=/www/story/07-27-2000/0001276963 announcement] of a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its light truck fleet â including its popular [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s â to be completed by the 2005 calendar year. However, in 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal. Ford did achieve significant progress toward improving fuel efficiency during 2005, with the successful introduction of the [[Ford Escape Hybrid|Hybrid-Electric Escape]]. The Escape's platform mate [[Mercury Mariner]] is also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model yearâa full year ahead of scheduleâdue to high demand. The similar [[Mazda Tribute]] will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line. In 2005, Ford announced its goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, and by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal. Other hybrids to come out will be the [[Ford Fusion]] and [[Mercury Milan]] Hybrid version in 2008. There are also plans for a Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX Hybrid. The Edge and MKX is Ford's new crossover SUVs to come out for the 2007 model year. Ford also continues to study [[Fuel Cell]]-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled [[internal combustion engine]] technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. To the extent Ford is successful in increasing the percentage of [[hybrid vehicle]]s and/or [[fuel cell]] vehicles, there will be a significant decrease not only of [[air pollution]] emissions but also reduced sound levels, with notable favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of [[noise health effects]].


===Economics===
{{NPOV-section}}

In the late 1990s Ford gained market share, with record profits, its stock price soared. The U.S. economy had experienced an increase in savings rates as the stock market rose. 

In 2001 the Ford motor company suffered a severe pension and benefit fund crisis, and the value of their pension funds plummeted. Ford's stock dropped, along with many other American companies. These events led to a widespread bond rating downgrades in the U.S. by the rating agencies, which eventually affected the automakers in 2005.

In May 2005, the recognized bond rating agencies downgraded the bonds of Ford Motor Company to below investment grade.  Stock market jitters brought on by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] combined with high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, higher fuel costs, and reliance by the company on profits from the sales of [[sport utility vehicle]]s led to the downgrades.  Profit margins decreased on large vehicles from increased "incentives" (in the form of rebates or low interest financing) to offset declining demand from high fuel costs.  Foreign manufacturers, not having the truck manufacturing capabilities to form a platform base for similar vehicles, have instead introduced so called [[Crossover SUV|"crossover" SUVs]] â vehicles built on an automobile or minivan platform rather than a truck chassis. These vehicles have proven to be very popular in the market, and Ford has introduced such vehicles as the [[Ford Escape|Escape]] (including a [[Ford Escape Hybrid|Hybrid-Electric]] version), along with the similar [[Mercury Mariner]], [[Mazda Tribute]], the [[Ford Freestyle|Freestyle]], [[Volvo XC70]], and [[Volvo XC90]] crossover SUVs. In the fall of 2006, Ford is scheduled to introduce the 2007 [[Ford Edge]], [[Lincoln MKX]], and [[Mazda CX-7]]. These vehicles were revealed at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] and other car shows. 

The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] delayed Ford's introduction of new product, and cost the company market share. In some ways, this has bolstered the false perceptions generated by Ford's long-time adversaries and critics.  Ford's new products have been well received by the public. The 2005 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] has had strong sales. Ford hopes to reverse its sales trend with the introduction of the new 2006 [[Ford Fusion (North American)|Ford Fusion]], [[Mercury Milan]], and [[Lincoln Zephyr]] mid-size cars, which are expected to compete well in this segment.
 
While rebates and reduced interest financing may be popular with the public, they have the tendency to erode residual value on paper, unless the residual value is calculated from the actual purchase price instead of the manufacturers suggested retail. Foreign manufacturers have used this to their advantage to generate the perception that their products 'hold value'. In fact, the consumer has saved money by purchasing the heavily incentivized domestically produced vehicle, while the buyer of the vehicle from the foreign manufacturer has actually paid higher interest charges.  

Ford continues to respond to false perceptions. Media critics claim that heavy incentives have an effect for owners who frequently trade-in and for those who lease their vehicles; the resale values are reflected in substantial cost differences, with domestic vehicles costing more in overall costs.  However, owners who frequently trade are typically from higher income brackets, are less influenced by the remaining balance on their loan or the residual value. Higher income buyers are more likely to trade to simply keep up with the latest trends. There is little evidence that these buyers from higher income brackets who frequently trade are deterred from buying a new car by value or loan balance. Middle income buyers are more likely to keep their vehicle until it is paid in full, and stand to benefit from heavy incentives and reduced rate financing the most.

==="The Way Forward"===
{{main|The Way Forward}}
Ford responded to the circumstances that led to the bond downgrade by creating a plan to reduce the company's fixed capital costs while maintaining a special focus on cars and car-based crossover vehicles. Over time, it hopes to make more of its product line profitable instead of relying on a limited portion of the products for profit. Making good profits across the product line requires that the company reduce the costs of development and production, while introducing new products that connect with consumers.

In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly-appointed Ford Americas Division President [[Mark Fields (businessman)|Mark Fields]] to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the Plan, dubbed ''The Way Forward'', at the [[December 7]], [[2005]] board meeting of the company; and it was unveiled to the public on [[January 23]], [[2006]]. "[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22465 The Way Forward]" includes [http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22464 resizing the company] to match current market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, and shutting down seven vehicle assembly plants and seven parts factories. Among these are plants in [[St. Louis Assembly]] (near [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]), [[Atlanta Assembly]] (near [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]), [[Batavia Transmission]] ([[Batavia, Ohio]]), [[Windsor Casting]] ([[Windsor, Ontario]], [[Canada]]), and [[Wixom Assembly]] ([[Wixom, Michigan]]).  Two more plants were later announced for closure in 2008: the [[Ford Ranger]] [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]] in [[St Paul, Minnesota]], and the [[Ford F-series]] Norfolk Assembly plant in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. <ref>{{cite web | title = Fordâs Twin Cities and Norfolk Assembly Plants Will be Idled as Way Forward Plan Moves Ahead | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=23128 }}</ref> Up to 30,000 hourly and salaried jobs (28% of the total workforce) in North America over the next six years are expected to be eliminated,<ref>{{cite web | coauthors = M.

These cutbacks are consistent with Ford's roughly 25% decline in U.S. automotive market share since the mid-late 1990s. Ford's target is to become profitable again in 2009, a year later than projected, which will cost a tremendous amount of money to achieve.  For the enthusiasts, Ford will build a Bullit Mustang in 2008, which they created for [[Motor Trend]] in the August 2005 cover story.

Ford's realignment also included the sale of its wholly owned [[subsidiary]], [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz Rent-a-Car]] to a [[private equity]] group for $15 billion in cash and debt acquisition. The sale was completed on [[December 22]] [[2005]]. A [[joint venture]] with [[Mahindra and Mahindra Limited]] of [[India]] ended with the sale of Ford's 15 percent stake in 2005.

Chairman Ford became president of the company in April 2006 with the retirement of [[Jim Padilla]]. Five months later, in September, he stepped down as CEO and named [[Alan Mulally]] as his successor. He will run the company with an executive operating committee made up of [[Mark Schulz]], [[Lewis Booth]], [[Don Leclair]], and [[Mark Fields]].

== Brands and marquees ==
Today, Ford Motor Company manufactures automobiles under several names including [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] in the United States. In 1958, Ford introduced a new [[marque]], the [[Edsel]], but [[List of commercial failures|poor sales]] led to its discontinuation in 1960. Later, in 1985, the [[Merkur]] brand was introduced; it met a similar fate in 1989.

Ford has major manufacturing [[List of Ford factories|operations]] in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and several other countries, including [[South Africa]] where, following divestment during [[apartheid]], it once again has a wholly owned subsidiary. Ford also has a cooperative agreement with Russian automaker [[GAZ]].

Since 1989, Ford has acquired [[Aston Martin]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Daimler Motor Company|Daimler (division of Jaguar)]], [[Land Rover]], and [[Rover (car)|Rover]] from the United Kingdom and [[Volvo Cars]] from [[Sweden]], as well as a [[Controlling interest|controlling share]] (33.4%) of [[Mazda]] of Japan, with which it operates an American [[joint venture]] plant in Flat Rock, Michigan called [[Auto Alliance]]. It has spun off its parts division under the name [[Visteon]]. Its prestige brands, with the exception of Lincoln, are managed through its [[Premier Automotive Group]].

Ford's non-manufacturing operations include organizations such as automotive finance operation [[Ford Motor Credit Company]]. Ford also sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the nation, most notably [[Ford Center]] in downtown [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Ford Field]] in downtown [[Detroit]]. It is also notable that both facilities share design aesthetics in addition to their common name and similar downtown location!

Overall the Ford Motor Company controls the following car marquees:
*[[Aston Martin]]
*[[Daimler Motor Company|Daimler]] (as Jaguar division)
*[[Edsel]]
*Ford
*[[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]
*[[Lagonda]] (as Aston Martin division)
*[[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester]] (as Jaguar/Daimler division)
*[[Land Rover]]
*[[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]]
*[[Mazda]]
*[[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]
*[[Merkur]]
*[[Rover (car)|Rover]] (marquee name only)
*[[Volvo]]

Aston Martin, Daimler Motor Company, Jaguar, Lagonda, Land Rover, Rover, and Volvo are controlled under the [[Premier Automotive Group]].

== Global markets ==
Initially, Ford models sold outside the U.S. were essentially versions of those sold on the home market, but later on, models specific to [[Europe]] were developed and sold. Attempts to globalize the model line have often failed, with Europe's [[Ford Mondeo]] selling poorly in the United States, while U.S. models such as the [[Ford Taurus]] have fared poorly in [[Japan]] and Australia, even when produced in [[right hand drive]]. The small European model [[Ford Ka|Ka]], a hit in its home market, did not catch on in Japan, as it was not available as an automatic. The Mondeo was dropped by [[Ford Australia]], because the segment of the market in which it competes had been in steady decline, with buyers preferring the larger local model, the [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]]. One recent exception is the [[Ford Focus|Focus]] â the European model has sold strongly on both sides of the [[Atlantic]].

===Europe===
[[Image:ford.cortina.red.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|1970 [[Ford Cortina]] Mark 2]]
At first, Ford in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] built different models from one another until the late 1960s, with the [[Ford Escort]] and then the [[Ford Capri]] being common to both companies. Later on, the [[Ford Taunus]] and [[Ford Cortina]] became identical, produced in [[left hand drive]] and right hand drive respectively. Rationalization of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] as well as Germany. The [[Ford Sierra]] replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames such as "Jellymould" and "The Salesman's Spaceship."

Increasingly, Ford Motor Company has looked to Ford of Europe for its "world cars," such as the Mondeo, [[Ford Focus|Focus]], and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], although sales of European-sourced Fords in the U.S. have been disappointing. In [[Asia]], models from Europe are not as competitively priced as Japanese-built rivals, nor are they perceived as reliable. The Focus has been one exception to this, which has become America's best selling compact car since its launch in 2000.

In 2001, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in more than eighty years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the [[Ford Transit|Transit]] van continues at the company's Southampton facility, engines at [[Bridgend]] and [[Dagenham]], and transmissions at [[Halewood]]. Development of European Ford is broadly split between [[Dunton]] in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and [[Cologne]] (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the [[Thames Trader|Thames]] range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965. It owns the Jaguar, Land Rover, and Aston Martin car plants in Britain, which are still operational. Ford's Halewood Assembly Plant was converted to Jaguar production. 

Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] range in [[Genk]] ([[Belgium]]), Fiesta in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]] ([[Germany]]), Ka in Valencia, and Focus in Valencia, [[Saarlouis]] (Germany) and [[Vsevolozhsk]] ([[Russia]]). Transit production is in [[Kocaeli]] ([[Turkey]]), [[Southampton]] (UK), and Transit Connect in [[Kocaeli]].

Ford also owns a joint-venture production plant in [[Turkey]]. Ford-Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the [[Transit Connect]] compact panel van as well as the "Jumbo" and long wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near [[Kocaeli]] in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk. Another joint venture plant near [[Setubal]] in [[Portugal]], set up in collaboration with [[Volkswagen]], assembles the [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]] people carrier as well as its sister ship, the [[VW Sharan]].

===Asia Pacific===
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the popular [[Ford Falcon]] is considered the typical (if not particularly economical) family car, though it is considerably larger than the Mondeo sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. Ford of that name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured locally. Like its [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] rival, the [[Holden Commodore]], the 4.0&nbsp;L Falcon retains rear wheel drive. High performance variants of the Falcon running locally-built engines produce up to 390&nbsp;hp. A [[Coupe Utility|ute]] (short for "utility," known in the US as [[pickup truck]]) version is also available with a similar range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sells highly-tuned Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, [[Ford Performance Vehicles]]. These cars produce over 400&nbsp;hp and are built in small numbers to increase their value as collectors' cars.

In Australia, the Commodore and Falcon outsell all other cars and comprise over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4 per cent.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kia soars ahead of the others | date = September 20, 2006 | url = http://subs.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=0008D79C-84BE-150F-80B783027AF100AD }}</ref>

Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller. However, with the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer [[Mazda]] in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella (also known as the [[Mazda 323|323]] and [[Mazda 626|626]]) as the [[Ford Laser]] and [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]]. The Laser was one of the most successful models sold by Ford in Australia, and outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it. The Laser was also built in Mexico and sold in the U.S. as the Mercury Tracer, while the 1989 American Ford Escort was based on the Laser/Mazda 323. The smaller [[Mazda 121]] was also sold in the U.S. and Asia as the Ford Festiva.

Through its relationship with Mazda, Ford also acquired a stake in [[South Korea]]n manufacturer [[Kia]], which later built the [[Ford Aspire]] for export to the United States, but later sold the company to [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Ironically, Hyundai also manufactured the Ford Cortina until the 1980s. Ford also has a joint venture with Lio Ho in [[Taiwan]], which assembled Ford models locally since the 1970s.

Ford came to [[India]] in 1998 with its [[Ford Escort]] model, which was later replaced by locally produced [[Ford Ikon]] in 2001. It has since added Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour to its product line.

===South America===
In [[South America]], Ford has had to face protectionist government measures in each country, with the result that it built different models in different countries, without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations. In many cases, new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with, or whose factories it had acquired. For example, the [[Ford Corcel|Corcel]] and [[Ford Del Rey|Del Rey]] in Brazil were originally based on [[Renault]] vehicles.

In 1987, Ford merged its operations in Brazil and Argentina with those of [[Volkswagen]] to form a company called [[Autolatina]], with which it shared models. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With the advent of [[Mercosur]], the regional common market, Ford was finally able to rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Ford EcoSport]] are only built in [[Brazil]], and the [[Ford Focus]] only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the [[Ford Mondeo]] from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the [[Ford Courier|Courier]], which is also produced in South Africa as the [[Ford Bantam]] in [[Driving on the left or right|right hand drive]] versions.

===Africa and Middle East===
In [[Africa]] Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in [[South Africa]] and neighboring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its Port Elizabeth facility. Later Ford sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], to form the [[South African Motor Corporation]] ([[Samcor]]). 

Following international condemnation of [[apartheid]], Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company. Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up, which saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the [[Mazda]]-based Laser and [[Telstar]]. Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in [[Samcor]] following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus and Mondeo Europe. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003.

Ford's market presence in the [[Middle East]] has traditionally been even smaller, partly due to previous [[Arab]] boycotts of companies dealing with [[Israel]]. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ford Motor Company: Global Websites | url = http://www.ford.com/en/company/about/countrySites/default.htm }}</ref> [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and the [[UAE]] are the biggest markets. Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford/Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were [[Ford Crown Victoria]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title = Al Jazirah Vehicles Hits 100,000 Mark with Ford and Lincoln in Saudi Arabia | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=14319 }}</ref> In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' 88,852 units and [[Nissan Motors]]' 75,000 units.

==Alternate fuel vehicles==
[[Image:Ford escape hybrid.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Ford Escape Hybrid]]]]
Bill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of an [[battery electric vehicle]], a [[Ford Ranger EV]], while the company contracted with the [[United States Postal Service]] to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. 
The alternative fuel vehicles, such as some versions of the [[Crown Victoria]] especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on [[compressed natural gas]] - or [[CNG]]. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks - one for gasoline, the other for [[CNG]] - the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch. Flexible fuel vehicles are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available fuel mixtures - from pure gasoline, to [[bioethanol]]-gasoline blends such as [[E85]] (85% [[ethanol]], 15% [[gasoline]]). Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles, is the general lack of establishment of sufficient [[infrastructure]] ([[fueling station]]s), which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers.  Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of [[E85]] fuels are underway and expanding.<ref>{{cite web | title = Alternative Power: Michigan sets sights on ethanol to become an energy hotbed | url = http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006603290456 }}</ref>

Current Ford Flexible Fuel Vehicles:<ref>{{cite web | title = Ford Motor Company | url = http://www.e85fuel.com/information/ford.php }}</ref>
* [[Ford F-150]]
* [[Ford Crown Victoria]]
* [[Ford Focus]] / [[Ford Focus C-MAX|Focus C-MAX]] / Ford Focus FFV ([[Flexible-fuel vehicle]]). 
* [[Ford Taurus]]
* [[Ford Ranger]]
* [[Mercury Grand Marquis]]
* [[Lincoln Town Car]]

Ford was third to the automotive market with a [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid electric vehicle]]: the [[Ford Escape Hybrid]], which also represented the first hybrid electric SUV to market.  The Hybrid Escape will also be the first hybrid electric vehicle with a Flexible Fuel capability to run on [[E85]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Ford Develops World's First Ethanol-Fueled Hybrid Marrying Two Gasoline-Saving Technologies | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=22474 }}</ref> The company had made plans to manufacture up to 250,000 hybrids a year by [[2010]], but has since had to back down on that commitment, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components.  Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo, Jaguar, and Land Rover.  This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.  Ford is also planning to produce 250,000 E85-capable vehicles a year in the US, adding to some 1.6 million already sold in the last 10 years.<ref>{{cite web | title = Leading the Way with Ethanol-Capable Vehicles | url = http://www.ford.com/en/innovation/technology/ethanolCapableVehicles/default.htm }}</ref> Ford also has launched the production of [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen-powered]] shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard [[Hydrogen vehicle#Hydrogen internal combustion|internal combustion engine]], for use at airports and convention centers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Bryce G | title = Ford to produce 'green' buses | publisher = The Detroit News | date = July 18, 2006 | url = http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060718/AUTO01/607180312 }}</ref>

At the 2006 [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]], Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explore SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174 horsepower. It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional modelâs automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles, the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen- powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology Ford being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.


Current and planned Ford hybrid electric vehicles:
* 2004â [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]
* 2005â [[Ford Five Hundred]]/[[Mercury Montego]]
* 2006â [[Mercury Mariner]]
* 2008â [[Ford Fusion]]/[[Mercury Milan]]
* 2009â [[Ford Edge]]/[[Lincoln MKX]]

== Criticism ==

Throughout its history, the company has faced a wide range of criticism. Detractors of the company in the past have accused the early [[Fordism|Fordist]] model of production of being extremely dehumanizing and exploitative, as well as characterizing the company as oppresive and unscrupulous, willing to collaborate with [[dictatorship]]s or hire mobs to intimidate union leaders and increase their profits through unethical means.
Detractors of the company often point out to the fact that Ford refused to allow [[collective bargaining]] well until [[1941]], with the Ford Service Department being set up as an internal security, intimidation, and espionage unit within the company, and quickly gained a reputation of using violence against union organizers and sympathizers (see [[The Battle of the Overpass]]).<ref>{{ cite web | title = Ford Motor Company Chronology | url = http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/fmc/battle.asp }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | title = Detroit News: The Battle of the Overpass | url = http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=172&category=events }}</ref>

===Nazi Collaboration===

Other criticism comes from accusations that the company actively collaborated with the German [[Nazi]] regime and relied on German slave labour through contractors in said country. Many of these allegations have been proven in a series of [[United States]] lawsuits in [[1998]]<ref>{{ cite web | title = Ford and GM scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm }}</ref>, which showed that the company had used [[slave labour]] in [[Cologne]] between [[1941]] and [[1945]] and that it had also engaged in production of military vehicles for the fascist regime.
Furthermore, detractors point out to [[Henry Ford]]'s outspoken nazi ideas, including his 1920's pamphlet "''The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem''", and the fact that in [[1938]], long after the vicious character of Hitler's government had become clear, Ford accepted the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the Nazi regime's highest honor for foreigners.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Corporations and Nazis: Ford and the FÃ¼rher | url = http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Corporations/Ford_Fuhrer.html }}</ref>.

Defenders of the company, however, argue that, as proved in a Ford-sponsored study, the Ford German division, Fordwerke, had been taken over by the Nazi government after it rose to power, and that it was not under the company's control.<ref>{{ cite web | title = The Ford Motor Company and the Third Reich | url = http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_13_2_ford.asp }}</ref> Critics reject this claims, and say that Ford still profited for the units manufactured and sold during those years.

=== Collaboration in the Argentine "Dirty War" ===
Ford company is also accused of collaborating with the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[1976]]-[[1983]] military dictatorship, actively helping in the political repression of intellectuals and dissidents that was pursued by said government.
In a lawsuit initiated in [[1996]] by relatives of some of the estimated 600 Spanish citizens who disappeared in Argentina during the military repression, evidence was presented to support the allegation that much of this repression was directed by Ford and the other major industrial firms. According to a 5,000-page report, Ford executives drew up lists of "subversive" workers and handed them over to the military "task forces" which were allowed to operate within the factories. These groups kidnapped, tortured and murdered workers - at times within the plants themselves.

The report brought by the [[Argentine Workers' Center|CTA]], among other allegations, also establishes that the company's Argentine factory was used between 1976 and 1978 as a detention center and that management allowed the military to set up its own bunker inside the plant.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Ford complicit in Argentine repression | url = http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/mar1998/arg-m20.shtml }}</ref>

==Auto racing==
[[Image:Todd Kluever.jpg|right|thumb|200px|NASCAR [[Ford Fusion]] race car]]
Ford is a major player in the scene of [[auto racing]] and [[motorsports]]. 

===NASCAR===
Ford is one of four manufacturers in the three [[NASCAR]] series: [[Nextel Cup]], [[Busch Series]], and [[Craftsman Truck Series]]. Major teams include [[Roush Racing]] and [[Robert Yates Racing]]. Ford's racing teams debuted the [[Ford Fusion (North American)|Fusion]] race car, replacing the [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]] at the 2006 [[Daytona 500]].

===Trans-Am===
Ford has a storied history in the [[Trans-Am]] series from the 1970s through today, having won many championships and races with its [[Ford Mustang]]. 

===Drag racing===
John Force has piloted his Drag [[Ford Mustang]] to several [[NHRA]] funny-car titles in recent seasons.

===Indianapolis 500===
Ford powered racing cars won the [[Indianapolis 500]] 17 times between 1965 and 1996.

[[Image:Stewart gp barrichello 1998.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Rubens Barrichello]] driving for the [[Stewart Grand Prix]] team in 1997]]

===Formula One===
Ford was heavily involved in [[Formula One]] for many years, and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by [[Cosworth]], the racing division of which was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as [[Team Lotus]] and [[McLaren]]. Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the [[Jaguar Racing]] name, after buying out the [[Stewart Grand Prix]] team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford pulled out of the category after the [[2004 Formula One season|2004 season]], selling both Jaguar Racing (which became [[Red Bull Racing]]) and Cosworth (to [[Gerald Forsythe]] and [[Kevin Kalkhoven]]).<ref>{{cite news | last = Moffitt | first = Alastair | title = Red Bull give Jaguar F1 wings | publisher = Red Bull give Jaguar F1 wings | date = November 15, 2004 | url = http://sport.independent.co.uk/motor_racing/article20376.ece }}</ref>

===Rally===
Ford has also been active many years in the [[World Rally Championship]], and has used various versions of the [[Ford Focus WRC]] since 1999 to much success. In 2006 Ford WRC secured the FIA World Rally Championship manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS. Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 75 consecutive races, since the opening round in the 2002 championship. Ford has a very long history in rally racing, having previously run the [[Ford RS200]] and many versions of the [[Ford Escort]] and Ford Sierra to great success.

===Sports cars===
Ford sports cars have always been visible in the world of endurance racing. Most notably the [[GT40]] won the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] four times in the 1960s and still stands today as one of the all-time greatest racing cars. The GT40 is the only American car to ever win Le Mans.

Ford currently holds the manufacturers title (2005) for [[Grand-Am|Grand-American Racing Cup]] with the FR500C Mustang race car.

Also, some companies customize ford sports cars shuch as [[Ronaele]].

===Touring cars===
Ford has campaigned touring cars such as the [[Ford Focus|Focus]], [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]], and [[Ford Contour|Contour]]/[[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and the [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] [[Cosworth]] in many different series throughout the years. Notably, the Mondeo finished 1,2,3 in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 2000, and the Falcon finished 1,2,3 in the Australian [[V8 Supercar]] Series in 2005.

===Formula Ford===
This formula for single-seater cars without wings and originally on road tires were conceived in 1966 in the UK as an entry-level formula for racing drivers. Many of today's racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.
