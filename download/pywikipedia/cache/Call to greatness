==Show Info==
Call to Greatness is a show on [[mtv]]. Team C2G, short for Call to Greatness, tries to beat any world record humanly possible. C2G travels all over the U.S. and tries to beat as many world records as they can on each episode. This has included shot putting a tuba as far as they can, eating a certain food in a certain amount of time, beating a speed record of an unexpected item (such as the fastest living room space, built on a truck), and much more. They tried to blow the biggest bubble with gum. Then Paul took already chewed gum off the wall and ate it. 

Team C2G consists of Andreas, Drew, Ghost, Paul, and Rainbow
