'''French Guiana''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Guyane française'', officially ''Guyane'') is an [[overseas department]] (French:''[[département d'outre-mer]], or DOM'') of [[France]], located on the northern coast of [[South America]]. Like the other DOMs, French Guiana is also an [[overseas region]] of France. As a part of France, French Guiana is in the [[European Union]], and its currency is the [[euro]].<ref>French Guiana is pictured on all [[euro banknotes]], on the reverse at the bottom of each note, right of the Greek ΕΥΡΩ (EURO) next to the denomination.</ref>

== History ==   
{{main|History of French Guiana}} 
French Guiana was originally inhabited by a number of Native American peoples.  Settled by the French during the [[17th-century]], it was the site of [[penal]] settlements from 1852 until 1951; the 1970s saw the settlement of [[Hmong]] refugees from Laos. A movement for increased autonomy from France gained momentum in the 70's and 80's. Protests by those calling for more autonomy have become increasingly vocal; demonstrations in [[1996]], [[1997]] and [[2000]] all ended in violence.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of French Guiana}}
French Guiana, as part of France, is part of the [[European Union]], the largest part in area outside [[Europe]], with one of the longest E.U. external boundaries and a part of the Union outside Europe that is not an island along with the Spanish enclaves in Africa, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. The Head of State is the [[President of France]], who appoints a [[Prefect (France)|Prefect]] (resident at the [[Prefectures in France|Prefecture building]] in Cayenne) as his/her representative. There are two legislative bodies: the 19-member General Council and the 34-member Regional Council, both elected. French Guiana has two seats at the National Assembly in [[Paris]]. French Guiana has traditionally been conservative, though the socialist party has been increasingly successful in recent years. Though many would like to see more autonomy for the region, support for complete independence is very low.

A chronic issue affecting French Guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine [[gold prospecting|gold prospectors]] from [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]]. The border between the department and Suriname is formed by the [[Maroni River]], which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (France)|Gendarmerie]] to patrol. The border line with Suriname is disputed.

== Administrative divisions ==
Administratively, French Guiana is divided into [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], [[Cantons of France|cantons]], and [[Communes of France|communes]]:
* [[Arrondissements of the Guyane department|Arrondissements of Guyane (French Guiana)]]
* [[Cantons of the Guyane department|Cantons of Guyane (French Guiana)]]
* [[Communes of the Guyane department|Communes of Guyane (Cities of French Guiana)]]

== Geography ==
[[Image:French Guiana CIA.gif|right|Map Of French Guiana]]
{{main article|Geography of French Guiana}}
Though sharing cultural affinities with the [[French language|French]]-speaking territories of the [[Caribbean]], French Guiana cannot be considered to be part of that region, since the Caribbean Sea actually lies several hundred miles to the west, beyond the arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. 

French Guiana consists of two main geographical regions: a coastal strip where the majority of the people live, and dense, near-inaccessible [[rainforest]] which gradually rises to the modest peaks of the [[Tumac-Humac mountains]] along the Brazilian frontier. French Guiana's highest peak is [[Bellevue de l'Inini]] (851&nbsp;[[metre|m]]&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,792&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). Other mountains include [[Mont Machalou]] (782&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,566&nbsp;ft), [[Pic Coudreau]] (711&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,333&nbsp;ft) and [[Mont St Marcel]] (635&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,083&nbsp;ft), [[Mont Favard]] (200&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;656&nbsp;ft) and [[Montagne du Mahury]] (156&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;512&nbsp;ft). Several small islands are found off the coast, the three [[Iles du Salut]] Salvation Islands which includes [[Devil's Island]] and the isolated [[Ile de Connetable]] bird sanctury further along the coast towards Brazil.

The [[Barrage de Petit-Saut]] hydroelectric dam in the north of French Guiana forms an artificial lake and provides [[hydroelectricity]]. There are many rivers in French Guiana.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of French Guiana}}
French Guiana is heavily dependent on [[France]] for subsidies and goods. The main industries are fishing (accounting for three-quarters of foreign exports), [[gold]] mining and [[timber]]. In addition, the [[Centre Spatial Guyanais]] at [[Kourou]] accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs about 1700 people. There is very little manufacturing and agriculture is largely undeveloped. Tourism, especially [[eco-tourism]], is growing. Unemployment is a major problem, running at about 20% to 30%. Its per-capita GDP is $8,500.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of French Guiana}}
French Guiana's population of 200,000 (2006 est.), most of whom live along the coast, is very ethnically diverse. Estimates of the percentages of French Guiana ethnic composition vary, a problem compounded by the large numbers of legal and illegal immigrants (about 20,000).

'''Mulattos''' (People of mixed black and white ancestry) are the largest ethnic group, though estimates vary as to the exact percentage, depending upon whether the large [[Haitian]] community is included as well. Generally the Creole population is judged at about 60% to 70% of the total population with Haitians (comprising roughly one-third of Creoles) and 30% to 50% without. Roughly 14% are Europeans, the vast majority of whom are [[French people|French]].

The main Asian communities are the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] from [[Laos]] (1.5%) and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (3.2%, primarily from [[Hong Kong]] and [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang province]]). There are also smaller groups from various [[Caribbean]] islands, mainly [[Saint Lucia]]. The main groups living in the interior are the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]] (also called Bush Negroes) and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]].

The [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], descendents of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the [[Maroni River]]. The main Maroon groups are the Paramacca, Aucan (both of whom also live in [[Suriname]]) and the Boni (Aluku).

The main Amerindian groups (forming about 3%-4% of the population) are the [[Arawak]], [[Emerillon]], [[Galibi]] (now called the [[Kaliña]]), [[Palikour]], [[Wayampi]] (also known as Oyampi) and [[Wayana]].

The predominant religion in the country is [[Roman Catholicism]], though the Maroons and some Amerindian peoples still practice their own religions. The Hmong people are also mainly Catholic owing to the influence of Catholic missionaries who helped bring them to French Guiana.

== Notable People ==
* [[Florent Malouda]], French international [[Football (soccer)|football]] player.
* [[Henri Charriere]], an escaped French convict, imprisoned in and around French Guiana from 1933 to 1945.
* [[Malia Metella]], French swimmer, SC European Championships 2004: 1st 100m free.
* [[Bernard Lama]], former French international [[Football (soccer)|football]] player.
