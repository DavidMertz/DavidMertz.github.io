'''Aloysius (Alessandro Luigi) Gottifredi''' (d.[[1652]]) was the ninth [[Superior-General of the Society of Jesus]]. He was in office less than two months.

Father Gottifredi died at the house of the professed Fathers, Rome, within two months after his election, and before the Fathers assembled for the election and congregation had concluded their labour. He had been a professor of theology and rector at the [[Roman College]], and later secretary of the Society under Father [[Mutius Vitelleschi]].
