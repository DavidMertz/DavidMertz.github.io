One of the most significant threats from tropical cyclones is heavy rainfall.  Between 1970-2004, inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused a majority of the fatalities [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/inland_flood.shtml].  This statistic changed in 2005, when [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s impact alone shifted the most deadly aspect of tropical cyclones back to storm surge, which has historically been the most deadly aspect of strong tropical cyclones.  During the 2005 season, flooding related to [[Hurricane Stan]]'s broad circulation lead to 1662-2000 deaths.

==Australia==
In 1979, Cyclone Peter hovered offshore, causing a 24 hour rainfall of 1140mm/44.88" at Mt. Bellenden Ker on January 5th [http://www.cassowaryconservation.asn.au/Resource/WeatherRainfallCyclones.htm].  More recently, the early stages of Tropical Cyclone Grace led to heavy rainfall across northern Queensland; a 3 day total of 759 mm/29.88" was measured at Topaz during March 17-20, 2004 [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0403.txt].

==Bangladesh==
[[Image:MonsoonDepression2004091600.jpg|thumb|left|Monsoon Depression-September 16, 2004]]
This low-lying country has been the scene of the most epic tropical cyclone casualties in recent times.  A monsoon depression in mid-September 2004 led to heavy rains, with 280 mm/11.02" falling at Barisal in the 24 hour period ending at 1200 UTC on the 16th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0409.htm].  A tropical depression in early October 2004 visited the area, bringing as much as 227.2 mm/8.94" at Rangpur in the 24 hour period ending at 0000 UTC on the 8th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Belize==
The highest reported rainfall in what was formerly British Honduras occurred during [[Hurricane Keith]] in 2000 when 32.67" of rain fell in a 24 hour period at Phillip Goodson International Airport in Belize City [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2000keith.html].  It should be noted that equally rains could have fallen during [[Hurricane Hattie]]/Simone/Inga of 1961, [[Hurricane Fifi]] of 1974, and [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia]] of 1978.

==Bermuda==
Bermuda does not appear to get overwhelming rains out of tropical cyclones.  This could be because of the rapid pace storms usually pass Bermuda.  The highest rainfall as of late for the isle was the 151.4 mm/5.96" it received over two days from Cristobal on August 8th and 9th during the [[2002 Atlantic hurricane season]].  The highest documented amount is related to a hurricane from October 16th of the [[1939 Atlantic hurricane season]] which wrung out 186.7 mm/7.35" over a 30 hour period (from "Beware the Hurricane" by Terry Tucker).

==Canada==
Tropical cyclones are usually in transition to a non-tropical cyclone by the time they reach Canada.  Nevertheless, some still carry quite the punch.  [[Hurricane Hazel]] was such a cyclone.  Snelgrove reported 213.6mm/8.41" of rain which led to severe flooding in southeast Ontario with the powerful storm.  Hurricane Beth of the [[1971 Atlantic hurricane season]] was one of the heavier rainfalls on record from a tropical cyclone in Canada, with a storm total of 249.9mm/9.84" falling at Halifax.  The highest known rainfall report was from the non-tropical low which was once Tropical Storm Harvey of the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]], when 302 mm/11.89" fell at Oxford, Nova Scotia.

==China, Taiwan/Taipai, and the Tibet Autonomous Region==

===China===
[[Typhoon Nina (1975)]] caused the collapse of two huge reservoirs and ten smaller dams when 1062 mm/41.81" fell in Henan Province during a 24 hour period, which is the record for Mainland China.  More recently, Yueqing City reported 703.5 mm/27.70" in the 24 hour period in mid-August 2004 during Typhoon Rananim, which was a new record for Zhejiang Province [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0408.htm].

[[Image:Typhoonnanmadol.gif|thumb|right|Typhoon Nanmadol]]
===Taiwan/Taipei===
The mountainous island of Taiwan province saw more extreme rains from Typhoon Gloria during the [[1963 Pacific typhoon season]] when 1248 mm/49.13" of rain fell at Baxin during a 24 hour period.  The record for Taiwan province was set in Typhoon Carla during the [[1967 Pacific typhoon season]] when 1672 mm/65.83" fell at Xinliao during a 24 hour period [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/iwtc/ChenLianshou2-1.html].  Its most recent daily heavy rain event from a tropical cyclone was during Typhoon Nanmadol in December 2004, which dropped 907 mm/35.71" in the 24 hour period ending at 1600 UTC on December 3rd, with a 30 hour storm total of 1090 mm/42.91" accruing at Puluowan [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0411.htm].  Its heaviest storm total rainfall as of late fell during Typhoon Aere of August 2004, when 1546 mm/60.87" fell at Matala, Miaoli county in the 68 hour time frame ending at 1200 UTC on the 25th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0408.htm].

===Tibet Autonomous Region===
An early October 2004 tropical depression brought moisture into the highlands of Tibet, leading to daily precipitation of 60 mm/2.4" liquid equivalent to Che-Ku County all in the form of heavy snow, which was a new October daily precipitation record for both rain and snow.  This led to a loss of 340,000 kg of food, 230,000 kg of forage grass, and 263 livestock in the snowstorm [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Chuuk, Western Pacific==
Typhoon Pongosa on December 5-6, 2002 dropped heavy quantities of rain on Chuuk.  A 24 hour total of 181 mm/7.13" fell at the National Weather Service Office on Weno Island. [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/data/pdfs/Pongsona_assessment_Final.pdf]

==Cuba==
[[Hurricane Flora]] of October 1963 drifted across Cuba for four days, leading to extreme rainfall across the mountainous island country.  During the heaviest 24 hour period of rainfall, 735 mm/28.94" of rain fell at Santiago de Cuba.  Total amounts of 2033 mm/80.04" over 4 days and 2550 mm/100.40" over 5 days produced staggering loss of life in Cuba, where over 2000 perished [http://www.hidro.cu/hidrologia1.htm].

==Dominica, Southeast Caribbean==
[[Image:jeanne2004dominica.jpg|thumb|left|Jeanne near Dominica]]
The islands of the eastern Caribbean are constantly threatened by tropical storms and hurricanes, mainly between August and October.  As [[Hurricane Jeanne]] moved through the region, 422.3 mm/16.63" of rain fell during the 24 hour period ending at 1200 UTC on September 15th, 2004. [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0409.htm]

==Dominican Republic==
[[Hurricane Ivan]] led to heavy rainfall across the country, with 300.3 mm/11.82" falling at Santo Domingo in the 24 hour time frame ending at 1200 UTC on September 11th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0409.htm].

==Guadeloupe==
[[Hurricane Lenny]] passed by slowly to the north and northeast of this mountainous French island group.  The highest report noted was 466 mm/17.28" from Port-Louis Gendarmerier on Grand-Terre [http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/antilles/pack-public/cyclone/traj/traj99/special/lenny.htm].

==Guam, Western Pacific==
[[Image:Typhoontingting.jpg|thumb|right|Typhoon Tingting]]
Typhoon Tingting of June 27-28, 2004 was exceedingly wet in Guam, with many locations reporting over 508 mm/20" in 24 hours [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Enso/peu/2005_1st/guam_cnmi.htm].  Anderson AFB measured 525.3 mm/20.68" in a 24 hour period while the University of Guam caught 650.5 mm/25.61" in their gage during Super[[Typhoon Pongsona]]  [http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/75323.pdf] in 2002 [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/Pongsona.pdf].  Typhoon Chata'an brought rainfall exceeding 533 mm/21" to mountainous areas of south-central Guam [http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/programs/html/factsheets/pdfs/2003_0061.pdf].  The highest 24-hour rainfall amount noted in Guam was during [[Typhoon Pamela]] in May 1976, when 686.1 mm/27.01" fell [http://pao.cnmoc.navy.mil/pao/Heavyweather/thh_nc/guam/apra/graphics/tab2-8.gif].

==Haiti==
The mountainous country of Haiti has experienced some of the most powerful hurricanes on record, including [[Hurricane David]].  However, data from this country is sparse, and the highest rainfall noted for the country was 582.7 mm/22.94" at Camp Perrin[http://oreworld.org/rainfall.htm] during [[Hurricane Gordon]].

==India==
India can get struck by cyclones that form in the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea.  A monsoon depression during mid-September 2004 led to significant rainfall...with 48 cm/18.90" falling at Shardanagar, Uttar Pradesh in the 24 hour period ending at 0300 UTC on the 22nd.  A tropical depression in early October 2004 led to heavy rains in India.  The highest amount in 24 hours fell at Shillong, Meghalaya where 262 mm/10.31" was noted ending at 0300 UTC on the 8th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Jamaica==
This mountainous island country can get lashed with rainfall by slow-moving tropical cyclones in the western Caribbean Sea.  The November Hurricane from the [[1909 Atlantic hurricane season]] led to a four-day deluge across Jamaica.  The storm total of 2451 mm/96.50" at Silver Hill in the Blue Mountains remains the rainfall record for the mountainous island country [http://isis.uwimona.edu.jm/uds/GEOHAZARDS_2001/GEOHAZ2001-016.html].

==Japan==
The mountainous island archipelago is constantly struck by typhoons recurving out of the tropics.  In early September, Typhoon Nabi/Jolina of the [[2005 Pacific typhoon season]] caused severe damage, and brought a record heavy precipitation of 1321 mm/52.01" in three days in western Japan [http://www.wmo.ch/web/Press/Press743_E1.doc].  Typhoon Namtheum of July-August 2004 dropped 1243 mm/48.94" of rain over the 4 day period ending at 1500 UTC on August 2nd [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0407.htm].

Fran of the [[1976 Pacific typhoon season]] holds the national 24-hour precipitation record of 1174 mm/46.22" [http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/links.html.en].

In the Ryuku Islands, Typhoon Aere in August 2004 dropped 314.5 mm/12.38" of rain in the 65 hour period ending at 1400 UTC on the 25th at Ishigakihima [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0408.htm].

==Korea==
[[Image:Typhoonrusa.jpg|thumb|left|Typhoon Rusa]]
This peninsula of eastern Asia also sees its share of typhoons.  Typhoon Rusa in 2002 dumped 898 mm/35.35" of rainfall at Gangneung [http://www.drs.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/jsnds/download.cgi?jsdn_26_2_7.pdf] between August 31st and September 1st

==La Reunion Island, Indian Ocean==
This mountainous island remains the gold standard for world tropical cyclone rainfall records at several time frames[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E4.html].  Three tropical cyclones have staked their place in rainfall history:

Unnamed Tropical Cyclone (April 8-10, 1958):   World record for 48 hours (2467 mm/ 97.1") set at Aurere.

Tropical Cyclone Denise (January 7-8, 1966):    World record for 12 hours (1144 mm/ 45.0") and 24 hours (1825 mm/ 71.8") set at Foc-Foc.

==Mauritius, Southwest Indian Ocean==
Tropical cyclone Hennie of March 2005 brought rainfall totals of 202.8 mm/7.98" to Sans-Souci in the 24 hour period ending at 0000 GMT on the 19th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0503.htm].

==Madagascar==
[[Image:cycloneelita.jpg|thumb|right|Cyclone Elita]]
Tropical Cyclone Elita of late January/early February of the [[2003-04 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season]] crossed the island country three times, dropping 246.3 mm/9.70" of rain on Vohemar in 24 hours [http://www.weathermatrix.net/archive/tropical/summaries/0021.html].

==Mexico==
[[Hurricane Wilma]] (2005) drifted over the northeast portion of the Yucatan peninsula for a couple days, dropping significant rains.  A report of 1576 mm/62.05" in still being verified by the Servicio Meteorologicio Nacional in Mexico [http://smn.cna.gob.mx/ciclones/tempo2005/atlantico/wilma/wilma.pdf], which if verfied would be the wettest 24-hour period ever measured in Mexico.

==Mozambique==
Tropical Cyclone Eline in February 2000 dropped excessive rains across the country, with a maximum of 502 mm/19.76" falling at Levubu between the 22nd and 25th [http://www.saweather.co.za/Pressroom/2000/2000FebTCEline.jsp].

==Nepal==
During the early October 2004 tropical depression that affected the Indian Subcontinent, 51.3 mm/2.02" of rain fell at Kathmandu airport in the 24 hour period ending at 1200 UTC on the 7th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Niue, Southwest Pacific==

==Oman==
Surrounding desert usually weakens tropical cyclones as they approach from the Arabian Sea.  A tropical depression in late September 2004 moved over the country, which led to 24 hour rainfall amounts of 104.2 mm/4.10" at Salalah ending at 0000 UTC on the 30th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0409.htm].

==Pakistan==
Tropical cyclones from the Arabian Sea occasionally wander into Pakistan.  Like Oman, the dry air from the surrounding deserts leads to substantial weakening before a tropical cyclone can make landfall.  The remains of Onil of October 2004 struck the country as merely a remnant low.  However, rainfall amounts of 145 mm/5.71" fell in 36 hours between October 2nd and 3rd at Thatta [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Palau, Northwest Pacific==
Typhoon Dainmu went by in mid-June 2004.  A rainfall of 121.7 mm/4.79" was recorded at Koror during the 24 hour period ending at 0600 UTC on the 14th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0406.txt].

==Philippines==
[[Image:Typhoonmindulevis.jpg|thumb|right|Typhoon Mindulle/Igme]]
Typhoon Utor/Feria of the [[2001 Pacific typhoon season]] dumped 1085.8mm/42.45" of rainfall on Bagio City on July 4th, setting a new daily rainfall record.  Their previous daily rainfall record was set by [[Typhoon Zeb]]/Iliang of 1998 of 994.6 mm/39.16", which destroyed their rice crop for the season.  More recently, Typhoon Mindulle/Igme led to a 3 day rainfall of 1012.7 mm/39.87" in the time frame ending at 0000 UTC on July 1, 2004 [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0406.txt].

==St. Brandon, South Indian Ocean==
Tropical Cyclone Darius of New Year's Eve/Day of 2003/2004 passed about 45 miles west-northwest of the island.  Rainfall over the 24 hour period of closest approach was 135 mm/5.31" [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0312.txt].

==St. Martin/Maarten==
[[Image:lenny1999ir.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane Lenny]]
Wrong-way [[Hurricane Lenny]] of Mid-November 1999 slowed to a crawl as it approached this French/Dutch island from the west.  The highest amount measured was 866.6mm/34.12" at Gendarmerie [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1999lenny.html].

==Sri Lanka==
A tropical depression in early October 2004 led to heavy rains across the island.  The maximum was measured at Galle where 117.2 mm/4.61" fell in the 24 hour period ending at 0600 UTC on the 2nd [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0410.htm].

==Takaroa, French Polynesia, Southwest Pacific==
During Tropical Cyclone Judy of December 2004, 160 mm/6.30" of rain fell between 0000 and 1200 UTC on the 24th, bringing the 3 1/2 day rain total from the system up to 356 mm/14.02" [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0412.htm].

==Thailand==
Tropical Cyclones occasionally cross the Malay peninsula from the northwest Pacific into the Bay of Bengal.  Tropical Depression Muifa/Unding in November 2004 made landfall near Amphoe Tha Chana on around 1500 UTC on the 25th.  The highest 24 hour rainfall noted was 251.5 mm/9.90" at Prachaup Khirikhan [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0411.htm].

==Ulithi Atoll, Northwest Pacific==
Typhoon Dainmu went near the island group in mid-June 2004.  A 24 hour rainfall of 102.8 mm/4.05" was recorded at Falalop Island endinf at 0000 UTC on the 13th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0406.txt].

==United States Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Statistics==
On average, five [[tropical cyclone]]s of at least tropical depression strength lead to rainfall across the contiguous United States each year, contributing around a quarter of the annual rainfall to the southern United States.  While many of these storms form in the Atlantic Basin, some systems or their remnants move through Mexico from the Eastern Pacific Basin.  The average storm total rainfall for a tropical cyclone impacting the lower 48 from the Atlantic Basin is about 16 inches, with 70-75 percent of the storm total falling within a 24 hour period.  

===Top Ten United States Tropical Cyclones By Point Maximum===

Below is a list of the top ten highest storm total rainfall amounts from individual tropical cyclones across the lower 48 since 1980.  Much of the rainfall information was provided by the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC.

#   40.68"  Allison 2001
#   38.46"  Georges 1998
#   36.71"  Danny 1997
#   27.85"  Alberto 1994
#   25.67"  Allison 1989
#   25.56"  Dennis 1981
#   25.00"  Tropical Depression #1 of 1992 (Atlantic)
#   24.06"  Floyd 1999
#   23.57"  Frances 2004
#  22.39"  Frances 1998

===Maximum Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Per State===
[[Image:Tcstatemaxima19812005.gif|thumb|700px|left|U.S. Tropical Cyclone State Maxima]]
State maxima relating to tropical cyclones and their remnants are shown on the left, color coded by amount.  Tropical cyclones from the Atlantic Basin have the most sway along the Gulf coast and Eastern Seaboard.  Note the penetration of the impact of cyclones from the eastern Pacific, as states as far east as Michigan and Indiana owe their records to the remains of former hurricanes from the eastern Pacific basin.  It should be stated that rainfall related to the low pressure area once associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remnants aloft, are included in this sample.  No additional rainfall from pre-existing upper lows as seen before [[Hurricane Fran]] of 1996 or from upper cyclones that closed off behind former tropical cyclones such as [[Hurricane Juan]] of 1985 was included.

The state of Texas has the highest amounts, followed by Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi.  This is due to the fact that over the 25 year sample, the storms that have become quasi-stationary have been [[Tropical Storm Allison (2001)]] and [[Hurricane Danny (1997)]] are dominating the statistics.  Out West, the same can be said for [[Hurricane Nora (1997)]].  As the United States tropical cyclone rainfall climatology works back into the 1970's, the amounts across Texas, the West, and the Upper Ohio Valley are likely to increase due to the influence of [[Hurricane Agnes]] of 1972, [[Hurricane Eloise]] in 1975, [[Tropical Storm Amelia]] of 1978, [[Hurricane Frederic]] of 1979, and Pacific Cyclone Doreen from the [[1977 Pacific hurricane season]].  Data from the 1950's will increase amounts in New England.

===Average and Record Statistics Per Time Frame For the United States===
[[Image:ShortTermRainfallAccumulations.jpg|thumb|700px|right|U.S. Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Accumulations per time frame]]
To the right is a graphic showing averages and extremes for a 15 year sample of tropical cyclones and their remnants affecting the contiguous United States.  The units of the rainfall amounts are in inches, while the time units are in hours.  The bars in the graph express the percent of the storm total rainfall, which is defined to be 100 percent in the final column.  Note that, on average, as much as one-fourth of the total occurs in 2-3 hours, while half falls within 12 hours, and almost three-quarters of the storm total falls within a 24 hour period.  Cases where a cyclone scraped the coast were not separated out from those that made a more direct landfall.  Also, Pacific and Atlantic cases were not separated.  This all explains the average storm total of the sample being depressed to 338.8 mm/13.34".  On the bottom of the graphic are listed the averages per time frame and the records.  The records were mainly set during [[Tropical Storm Allison (2001)]] and [[Hurricane Danny (1997)]].  This graphic will be updated as the climatology pushes farther back in time.

==Vanuatu, Southwest Pacific==
Tropical cyclone Ivy in February 2004 led to 254.4 mm/10" of rain at Bauerfield on the 26th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0402.txt].

==Vietnam==
Typhoon Chanthu/Gener struck Quy Nhon during June 2004; the maximum rainfall amount was 238.9 mm/9.41" at Quy Nhon during the 24 hour period ending at 1200 UTC on the 12th [http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0406.txt].
Tropical Depression Pablo of September 2004 dissipated as it made landfall in Vietnam.  The highest 24 hour rainfall total was 134.5 mm/5.30" at Thanh Hoa in the time frame ending at 1200 UTC on the 19th.
