'''Ladner''' was created as a [[fishing]] [[village]] on the banks of the [[Fraser River]]. It is now part of the Municipality of [[Delta, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], and a suburb of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].

Named for one of the founding families, it developed as a center for farming and fishing. The ferry at Captain's Cove allowed for access across the river to [[Richmond, British Columbia]]. The [[George Massey Tunnel]] provided a permanent connection in 1959.

Paired together with its suburban neighbour to the south, [[Tsawwassen]], these two communities make up the unofficial region known as "South Delta".

Ladner had a population of 21,360 in the 2001 census.<ref>[http://www.corp.delta.bc.ca/EN/main/residents/740/residential_growth.html Corporation of Delta website], retrieved [[April 4]], [[2006]]</ref>

==History==

Like many areas around the [[Fraser River]] on what is now Greater [[Vancouver]] the area on the south side of the south arm of the Fraser was named for the original Europeans to settle there. First called Ladner's Landing, the area was settled by Thomas Ellis Ladner(1837-1922) and  William Henry Ladner(1826-1907). <ref>[http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/whoswho_L.htm  The History of Metropolitan Vancouver's Hall of Fame]</ref> They had travelled from their home in [[Cornwall]], UK to pursue the gold rush in California and later on the Fraser River. Settling on the area of the Fraser River Delta either side of the Chilukthan Slough in [[1868]], both turned to farming and fishing.<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/regions/towns/?townID=3367 Ladner] britishcolumbia.com</ref>

==Location and Features==

Ladner is bound to the west by the Strait of Georgia, the south by Tsawwasen, to the east by [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]], and north by the [[Fraser River]]. Ladner is bisected by [[Image:Bc17.png|20px]] [[British Columbia provincial highway 17|Highway 17]], which runs north-south from [[Image:Bc99.png|20px]] [[British Columbia provincial highway 99|Highway 99]] to the [[BC Ferries]] terminal. The term East Ladner is often applied to the portion of the community east of the highway. The major east-west artery is called Ladner Trunk Road - which, if traveled far enough east, turns into [[Image:Bc10.png|20px]] [[British Columbia provincial highway 10|Highway 10]]. West of Arthur Drive, a north-south road that connects it with [[Tsawwassen]]. West of Arthur Drive it is simply called 47A Avenue.

River Road runs east from the north end of Highway 17 along the Fraser River into North Delta and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. The area between Highway 17 and North Delta is referred to as Tilbury and is one of the major industrial centres of the Lower Mainland, with many large warehouses, industrial parks and factories.

Lying to the south of the delta of the Fraser River, there are numerous islands just off the mainland that are part of Ladner. Most are small and only reachable by boat, with exceptions like Reifel Island, which hosts a large bird sanctuary and is dedicated to protecting and preserving the numerous bird species found in the area, especially [[bald eagles]] and various [[owl]] species. Westham Island is a fairly large island and a popular destination for its numerous organic farms, especially its berry farms.

[[Image:CaptainsCoveMarinaLadner.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Captain's Cove Marina in north Ladner]]A major feature of Ladner is the portion called Ladner Village, which is in the section of the town north of Ladner Trunk Road and west of Arthur Drive. This is an heritage community with wide, boulevarded sidewalks, open-air cafes and local shops. There are some heritage residences in this area, mostly built in the 1930s, but apartment complexes replaced many of them some decades back. The Delta Museum and Archives are in the centre of Ladner Village, along with a town clock that is amongst the oldest in the [[Lower Mainland]].

On Ladner Trunk Road, east of Arthur Drive, two malls with supermarkets, major restaurants and other modern shops and services is found. The town is experiencing a boom of [[condominium]] development in this area, and the population is growing accordingly. Numerous parks are found throughout the community, especially along the [[canals]] which used to be used for transport through the area. No longer passable for boats, today they are still clean and fresh enough to allow fishing along their banks.

Ladner is home to two public swimming pools, one of which is an older outdoor facility located near the public library and community centre. A much larger pool is located on Harvest Drive next to the Municpal Hall. This indoor pool features a large 25m main pool, a smaller leisure pool, a swirl pool, sauna, waterslide and rock climbing wall. Also located in this facility is a skating rink and a gymnasium partially funded by Vancouver's Junior Hockey Team, the [[Vancouver Giants]].

Ladner is the location of the Delta Municipal Hall, police station, and the Delta Hospital. Public education is administered by [[School District 37 Delta]]. Schools include [[Delta Secondary School]] and K-7 elementary schools including [[Hawthorne Elementary School|Hawthorne]], [[Delta Manor Elementary School|Delta Manor]], [[Holly Elementary School (Delta, British Columbia)|Holly]], [[Ladner Elementary School|Ladner]], and [[Port Guichon Elementary School|Port Guichon]]. Independent K-7 schools [http://sacredheartparish.ca Sacred Heart] and Delta Christian also serve local students.

On [[March 1]], [[2006]], Ladner made national headlines when an out-of-control house party resulted in hospitalization of the 13-year old host for alcohol poisoning and nearly [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]70,000 in damage.<ref>[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2006/03/01/1467820-sun.html Edmonton Sun], [[March 1]], [[2006]]</ref> It was the third such party in South Delta in the last year.<ref>[http://www.delta-optimist.com The Delta Optimist], [[March 1]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Holidays and Attractions==

Each spring Ladner hosts the '''Ladner Pioneer May Days''' (commonly referred to by residents simply as '''May Days'''), the longest-running festival in Delta, which is held on the weekend following the holiday commemorating [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s birthday. It includes a parade, a carnival, and other local events. Every other Sunday during the summer months the major streets in the village are reserved for a [[farmer's market]] featuring live music, food, entertainment, fresh local produce and homemade arts and crafts. Vendors from as far away as [[Kelowna]] and [[Vancouver Island]], along with many local farmers and artisans, set up stalls selling hand-crafted and locally grown products. This market has become a major draw to the community, attracting a few thousand out-of-town visitors each market day.

==Ladner On Film==

The Ladner Village area is popular with film crews for its "Main Street USA" feel, quaint coastal fishing settings, and heritage church buildings. The general South Delta area also provides open landscapes of farmland, ocean beaches, forest and wetlands, all within a few kilometres of each other. These features make the area a popular location for movie productions such as ''[[Final Destination]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Deck the Halls (film)|Deck the Halls]]'', and ''[[X-Men 3]]'', as well as various television productions such as ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Three Moons Over Milford]]''.
