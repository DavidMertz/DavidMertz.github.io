'''Tronus Abyss''' is a cult "electro-apocalyptic" band from Italy. They started out in [[1997]] with a quite plain symphonic black metal album ("The King of Angel in the Abyss"), but in [[1999]] they recorded "Rotten Dark", an album crossing the boundaries of extreme music and redefining new styles. Rotten Dark was a mix of powerful black metal, [[industrial music|industrial]], medieval profane music, neoclassical and apocalyptic-folk.

In [[2003]], they redefined again their style with another extreme album called "Kampf". Labelling their style as "electro-apocalyptic", in Kampf they moved toward an electronic and boombastic style, yet obscure and malevolent. Definitely not an easy-listening record, the press defined Kampf as a true masterpiece due to his originality and revolutionary musical approach.

Tronus Abyss is always been considered a serious, cult band in the so-called extreme scene. The members (currently Malphas, Atratus and Mord) have always been seriously involved in esoteric and cultural background activities, sometimes disturbing to the most due to their flirting with extreme [[Traditionalist School|Traditional]] right-wing topics (not political, but mostly related with Traditional esoteric philosophies and philosophers - [[Julius Evola|Evola]], [[René Guénon|Guénon]], [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu|Codreanu]], etc.) in lyrics and aesthetics.
