'''''Chicken Man''''' was a [[radio]] series created in the [[1960s]] by [[Dick Orkin]] when he was a production director at [[WCFL]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

''Chicken Man'' was a comedy radio program which spoofed comic book heroes.  It was based loosely on the [[Batman]] television series.  The show started in the fall of [[1966]] as a segment on the [[Jim Runyun Show]] on WCFL.  Orkin played the voice of Chicken Man in the radio program's 273 episodes.  The show's main character worked as a shoe salesman by day who became the crime fighting "Winged Warrior."

''Chicken Man'' joined ''The Shadow'' on Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) throughout the 1970's particularly in host countries where broadcast television was not available.
