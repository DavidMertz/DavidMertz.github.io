'''Merit badges''' are awards earned by youth members of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA), a [[United States|U.S.]]-based organization, based on activities within an area of study by completing a list of periodically updated requirements.  Each merit badge has a pamphlet published by the Boy Scouts of America associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge.  Certain merit badges are required in order to achieve the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America.  Merit badges are displayed on a sash which may be optionally worn diagonally across the front of the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout uniform]].

The current merit badge system began in 1979; three merit badges have not been updated since that time &ndash; Athletics, Mammal Study and Pulp and Paper.  The most recent new merit badges Nuclear Science, created in 2005 as a redesigned Atomic Energy badge; Snow Sports, created in 1999 as a redesigned Skiing merit badge; and Fly Fishing, split off from the Fishing merit badge in 2002.  The most recent completely new merit badges are Composite Materials, created in 2006{{ref|Composite}}; Archaeology and Climbing, both  created in 1997; and Entrepeneurship, created in 1998.  The Boy Scouts of America are, as of 2005, field-testing a Hunting merit badge.{{ref|research}}

Besides the BSA, these Scouting organizations are known to issue or have issued merit badges: [[Scouts Canada|Canada]], [[Scout Association of Japan|Japan]], [[Federación de Escultismo en España|Spain]], [[The National Scout Organization of Thailand|Thailand]], [[Gerakan Pramuka|Indonesia]] and the [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom]].  [[Austrian Scouts and Girl Guides|Austria]] has a program similar to merit badges for certain age groups.

==Merit Badge Colleges==

Merit Badge Colleges, which are also called ''Merit badge weekends'' or ''Merit badge midways'' when held at a camporee or jamboree, are events held where several troops or merit badge counselors come together and focus on teaching merit badges. There is some controversy  whether [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle]]-required merit badges should be available. Some believe that Scouts wishing to earn the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout should be able to seek out counselors for those badges themselves and do the requirements solo. Others believe all merit badges should be available to all Scouts.
