The '''Battle of Ujebardha''' (also Albulena) was fought on [[September 2]], [[1457]] between [[Albania]]n forces led by [[Skanderbeg]] and an expeditionary force of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It was one of Skanderbeg's most important victories against an Ottoman army in the open field.



The Ottoman expeditionary force was approximately as high as 70,000 men, although it is doubtful they numbered more than 30,000 in the actual battle, as several thousand were deployed in several different regions of the countryside. The Albanian forces, numbering around 20,000, confronted the Ottoman army on the field of [[Ujebardha]] located halfway between [[Lezhë]] and [[Krujë]].

==Background==
The [[battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] had caused a defeat of [[John Hunyadi]]. Skanderbeg and his forces had allegedly been hindered in his planned assistance of the Hungarian army, and never arrived at the battle, but it is doubtful it would have made much difference due to the size of the Ottoman force. Following that victory, the Ottoman's were free from Hungarian pressure in that part of the [[Balkans]], and Mehmed II turned his attention to the conquest of Belgrade. 

In [[1456]] Sultan [[Mehmed II]] marched a force of more than 150,000 soldiers against [[Belgrade]] in [[Serbia]]. The [[citadel]] of Nándorfehérvár, as it was then called, other than being a [[Christian]] [[stronghold]], was also of a great strategic importance since it guarded the backdoor to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The [[Siege of Belgrade]] lasted several weeks, but the intervention of '''John Hunyadi''', the [[voivode]] of [[Transylvania]], saved the city and caused the sultan's defeat, and withdrawal. Three weeks after this victory had been achieved, however, Hunyadi died of [[pandemic|plague]] on [[August 11]] [[1456]], which meant for Skanderbeg that Albania would likely face the Ottoman army alone. Prior to this, most major battles against the Ottoman invasion were fought by other [[eastern European]] resistance forces, and Skanderbeg had been quite successful in mostly [[guerilla warfare]]. In pitched battle, however, his forces could not withstand due to sheer numbers. His only advantage would be surprise.

==The commanders==
In spring [[1457]], [[Mehmed II]] dispatched a force of between 50,000 and 70,000 soldiers, led by [[Isa Beg Evrenoz]] and [[Hamza Kastrioti]], Skanderbeg's nephew. Evrenoz had achieved victory over Skanderbeg previously, having defeated him in the [[Siege of Berat]]. Hamza had proven himself over the years, but he nurtured hopes to one day inherit the principality of Albania after Skanderbeg. His ambition proved too much for him, for when Skanderbeg fathered a child with [[Andronika Kastrioti]], Hamza felt cheated by fate and, overcome with jealousy, he betrayed Albania by joining the Ottomans. 

Both of the Ottoman leaders were competent commanders. An added asset for Hamza was that he had spent 14 years by the side of Skanderbeg and knew every military tactic his uncle had employed against the Ottomans. By vanquishing Albania, the Sultan could resume his two-pronged attack on [[Europe]] by reaching [[Rome]] and [[Vienna]], his proclaimed ambitions.

Skanderbeg, leading the Albanian forces,  had served several years in the Ottoman army, as both soldier and commander, before escaping to his homeland. He had also achieved some success previously against the Ottoman invasions of Albania, and had successfully defended his castle against prior Ottoman siege attempts.

==The battle==
The plan was to engage Skanderbeg and defeat him, realizing that without Skanderbeg Albanian resistance would break quickly. Evrenoz entered the valley of the [[Mat River]] and proceeded slowly westwards toward [[Krujë]]. A few minor clashes ensued, after which Skanderbeg withdrew his forces. Unhindered, the Ottomans carried on, plundering the small settlements and harassing the population for information. After several weeks and no sign of Skanderbeg, Evrenoz and Hamza were induced into believing that Skanderbeg had fled. Sketchy reports were coming in that he had lost the loyalty of the army, who had deserted him, and he was attempting to cross the border over to the domains of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. In fact, on [[July 21]], [[Marco Diedo]], the Venetian [[governor]] of [[Durrës]] had written to the republic’s [[senate]] that: “The Magnificent Skanderbeg, deserted by all was trying to find refuge high in the mountains, while the [[Ottoman Turks|Turk]] ruled supreme in Albania."

In August the position of the Ottomans in Albania seemed solidified. 20,000 soldiers protected the supply routes, while keeping under siege the forts in [[Cidhna]], [[Dibra]], [[Guri i Bardhe]] (White Stone). Another 15,000 or more put to siege the fortresses of [[Mat District|Mat]], [[Rodon]], and [[Petrela]]. The rest of the army, some 30,000 or so by some estimates, moved from the gully of Mat to [[Ujebardha]], northwest of Krujë and south of [[Lezhë]] so that both cities could be kept under watch, as well as giving the army something to do to keep morale in place. By the end of August, three months after they crossed the border, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army seemed to have reached a level of complacency, and its vigilance had lowered significantly.

On September 2 Skanderbeg went on the offensive. He had to deliver a strong and surprising thrust to the main Ottoman army and destroy it before any of the additional forces that were roaming the country free could come to its relief. If the battle lasted too long, and his forces were forced to fight head to head with a sizable Ottoman force, the odds would be in favor of the Ottomans. Small Albanian detachments harassed the outer Ottoman patrols, while the main body of the Albanian army approached the northern side of the camp. At noon, the Ottomans were awakened from their midday sleep to find their enemy already within their camp. An infernal noise, produced by thousands of metal-clapping devices, gave the impression that they were facing a large force. Confusion settled in as the Albanian cavalry charged on from the west, while the infantry punched its way through to the center of the camp. 

Soon confusion turned to panic as Ottoman unit commanders failed to address the situation properly. An attempt at a defense was mounted by Hamza, but Skanderbeg had placed considerable care in defeating Hamza and his [[sipahis]] first, by sending his personal guard of 2,000 cavalry. Hamza was pushed back in panic and the thrust had achieved complete surprise. Within two hours the Ottoman camp was entirely in Albanian hands, while the remnants of the defeated army made their way through the valley of [[Tirana]] and on to [[Elbasan]]. The Ottoman casualties were believed to be as high as 10,000, whereas the Albanians lost less than 3,000. 

Hamza Kastrioti was captured alive and sent to detention in [[Naples]] on charges of [[treason]]. He was freed later and went with his wife and children in the Ottoman Empire, where he died as a beggar in the early [[1460]]s.

==Significance==
The Battle of Ujebardha was significant for the southern resistance against the Ottoman Empire. If Albania had fallen in [[1457]], the invasion of [[Italy]] would have started thirteen years before it actually did, and fourteen years before the death of [[Mehmed II]]. As it was, Ujebardha bought Skanderbeg and Italy some time, which was to materialize in a three year armistice between Mehmed II and Skanderbeg in [[1460]]. It also diverted Ottoman forces away from their ultimate goal, Vienna. 

In [[1461]] Skanderbeg started his campaign in Italy to protect his ally, King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], in his struggle to retain his throne from the contender house of [[Anjou]]. Ferdinand, as was his father King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], was Skanderbeg’s most important ally supplying him with money, supplies and modern weapons. The constant struggle in Albania had caused the virtual collapse of its economy, and the continuation of a close Albanian-Neapolitan cooperation was vital in the struggle against the Ottomans.
