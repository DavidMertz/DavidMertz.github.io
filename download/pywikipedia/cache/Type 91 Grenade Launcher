===Shoulder-Fired===
The shoulder-fired launcher is a single-shot, manual-fed, and breech-loading. This weapon would not commonly be carried as a primary weapon but, instead, be used by the breach man, the unit of a team who would carry breach items during an assault.
===Rifle-Attached===
The rifle-attached variant could be mounted on the underside of either a Type56, Type 81, or Type 95. It is lightweight, compact, breech-loading, and single-shot. It consists of a hand guard, sight, aluminum receiver assembly, barrel stop, and firing mechanism. The weapon could be used by any front-line assault troop in need of a long range explosive.
===Vehicle-Mounted===
This version of the Type 91 can be mounted on the WZ-551 internal security armored vehicle. It can fire in automatic and semi-automatic modes. The launcher is air-cooled, recoil operated, disintegrating metallic link-belt fed non lethal weapon.
