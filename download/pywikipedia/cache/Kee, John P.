Pastor '''John P. Kee''' (born John Prince Kee in [[1962]], known as the "Prince of Gospel") is widely known as one of the most influential and well known gospel artists today. His 15 years plus career in gospel is a testament to his calling to praise God and minister to people through song. He is known for his ability to mix traditional gospel with modern contemporary gospel with his high, "James Brown-like" husky voice. Currently he has made a new CD released on December 5, 2005, entitled "The Reunion", which features some of the old members of his famed New Life Community Choir.

==Early life==
John P. Kee was born the 15th out of 16 children in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. At an early age he began to develop a musical talent, both instrumental and vocally. Because of his talent, began to go to the North Carolina School of the Arts in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]. At the age of 14, he moved to [[California]] with his brothers, Wayne and Al, attending the Yuba College Conservatory School of Music in Marysville. During this time, he began to play with famous groups such as [[Cameo]] and Donald Byrd and the Blackboards. It was during this time that his life started to go downhill. A hard life would follow him from his native state of [[North Carolina]] to [[California]] and back. When he returned home, he resided in [[Charlotte]] where he lived in the Double Oaks Community, a place known at the time for its violence and drug infested slums. It would take an act of violence (watching one of his friends murdered in a drug deal gone bad) to rededicate his life back to [[God]]. He surrendered his life to Christ during a revival meeting and has since then, been on a steady increase.

== The New Life Community Choir ==
In the mid 1980's, Kee formed a community choir in [[Charlotte]]. Over time, the choir began to build success and traveled throughout the area. The choir, which also included some of his children, eventually grew to the world-renowned choir known as the New Life Community Choir, sometimes referred to as "New Life" or "NLCC"

== Calling to Ministry and the New Life Fellowship Center ==
One night, while traveling with the choir in Michigan, he received his calling from God to be a preacher in his mid-twenties, and a few years later, he was ordained as a minister to preach the gospel of [[Jesus Christ]]. In 1995 while ministering in [[Ohio]], he received a propehtic vision through Bishop Norman Wagner. In early 1995, Pastor Kee went forward and set his sights at building a Fellowship Center in [[Charlotte]] to preach and teach and minister the Word of [[God]] to the people in the community. He officially founded the New Life Fellowhip Center, where he accepted the call to minister and pastor of the church. It stands on the same ground where he once lead a life of crime and drugs. Pastor Kee does not accept a salary from the church, but is satisfied in knowing that the preaced word of [[God]] has been brought forth. In December of [[1995]], he married the former Felice Sampson, and with this union, they are the parents of eight children.

== The Victory in Praise Music and Arts Seminar Mass Choir ==
In 1990, Pastor Kee founded the Victory in Praise Music and Arts Seminar Mass Choir, or "V.I.P." in order to fellowship among ministries, song writers, musicians and choir directors from all over the country. Since 1991, the V.I.P. choir has made record deals.
