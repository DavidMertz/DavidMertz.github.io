This [[valse]] ([[waltz]]) is nicknamed the "L'adieu" valse. 

This slower piece starts off with a beautiful melody that can be heard several times throughout the song ''(playing around first the +1 octave D, going down to play about B-flat, down further to -1 octave E then jumps upwards to +1 octave C-sharp and flows down again for an emotive (but complex for the unflexible) stroll up some notes from A-flat to +1 octave F-sharp, after which the first melody concludes with slow descent back to the E-flat region and a soft simple chord. Now all of this repeated a second time, identical apart from instead of "an emotive stroll up '''some''' notes from A-flat to +1 octave F-sharp" it is "a stroll up '''ALL''' notes: Complex for the unaccustomed!!!))''. This melody starts the song off.

Then follows a '''second melody''' ''(with the right hand doing a short and slow trill starting on Bflat, then flying up 1 octave higher and going back down)''. This second melody is repeated, and then it goes back to the original melody and plays through to a-

-'''third melody''' ''(2 chords, a d flat and a trill, three chords, the same d and trill again)''. The third melody repeats, and then the first melody is played. A repeat of the third melody (again twice) and finally the first melody again ''(with instead of a "stroll on some notes between A-flat and +1 octave F-sharp, a brief (and difficult to re-enact!!!) smoothness that binds together the notes over the A-scale octave)'', finalising with the playabout over -1 octave E-flat and again the soft simple chord (see melody one).

Although the right hand IS the melody carrier throughout the waltz, the left hand plays a major part as well, mostly in defining variation such as in the second melody where it is the transition between the melody's start throughout the repeats. 

Together the piece sounds like one of Chopin’s classics!
