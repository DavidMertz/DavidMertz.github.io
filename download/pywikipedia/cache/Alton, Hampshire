==History==
===Origins===
A Roman road ran from [[Chichester, West Sussex|Chichester]] to [[Silchester]] and there is evidence of a Roman posting station at Neatham near Alton, probably called Vindomis, and a [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across the [[River Wey]]. Centuries later, a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] settlement was established in the area and a large seventh century cemetery has been discovered during building excavations. It contained a selection of [[grave goods]] which included the ''Alton Buckle'' which is on display in the [[Curtis Museum]], and is considered to be the finest piece of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo Saxon]] craftsmanship found in Hampshire. The buckle was found in the grave of a warrior, and has a silver-gilt body, set with garnets and glass.<ref name="RWaN">{{cite web | author=Wey River| year=2006| title=More about Alton, Hampshire | work=River Wey & Navigations | url=http://www.weyriver.co.uk/theriver/places_4_alton.htm | accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref>

The River Wey has its source in the town, and the name ''Alton'' comes from an Anglo-Saxon word ''"aewielltun"'' meaning ''"farmstead at the source of the river"''.<ref name="PNoH">Coates, Richard (1989), ''Place Names of Hampshire'', Batsford.

===Battle against the Danes (1001)===
In 1001 Danish forces invaded England, plundering, ravaging and burning, and spreading terror and devastation. When they reached Alton, the men of Hampshire came together and fought against them. About 81 English were killed, including Ethelwerd the King's high-steward, Leofric of Whitchurch, Leofwin the King's high-steward, Wulfhere a bishop's thane, and Godwin of Worthy, Bishop Elfsy's son. Danish casualties were higher, but the Danes won the battle and fleeing Englishmen took refuge in [[Winchester]].<ref name="tASC">{{Harvard reference | Last=Ingram | First=Rev.

===Domesday Book (1086)===
Alton is listed as having the most valuable recorded market in the [[Domesday Book]] under the name '''Aoltone''' in the 'Odingeton Hundred — Hantescire'<ref name="RWaN" /><ref name="DB">Domesday Book, 1086</ref> 

[[Image:Henry1.jpg|right|90px|thumb|Henry I]]
===The Treaty of Alton (1101)===
:{{main|Treaty of Alton}}
The [[Treaty of Alton]] was an agreement signed in [[1101]] between [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] eldest son [[Robert Curthose|Robert, Duke of Normandy]] and his brother [[Henry I of England]]. Henry had seized the throne while his elder brother was away on the [[first crusade]]. Robert returned to claim the throne, landing in [[Portsmouth]]. The two brothers met in Alton and agreed terms which formed the Treaty of Alton. Part of the main street through Alton is called Normandy Street, probably reflecting this event.

===Markets, fairs and the Royal Charter (1307)===
The first recorded Saturday market in Alton was in 1288. It was much bigger than the current weekly market and established Alton as a significant market town.  Blome wrote in 1673 of a 'market on Saturdays, which is very great for provisions, where also are sold good store of living cattle'<ref name="BH">Blome's Hampshire, 1673</ref>. The Saturday market is also featured on Kitchin's map of Hampshire (1751) which marks the town as ''Alton Mt. Sat.''<ref name="KH1751">{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=Kitchin | year=1760 | title=A NEW Improved MAP of HAMPSHIRE from the best SURVEYS & INTELLIGENCES Divided into its HUNDREDS Shewing the several ROADS and true Measured Distances between Town and Town ALSO the Rectories & Vicarages the Parks and Seats of the Nobility & Gentry with other useful Particulars Regulated by ASTRONL.

In 1307 [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] presented the town with a [[Charter]] giving it the right to hold an annual [[fair]], mainly for cattle and toys. [[Mediaeval]] fairs were like markets but they were held once a year and attracted buyers and sellers from a wide area. Alton still has an annual fair, but it now takes the form of a [[funfair|fun fair]].<ref name="Alton2002" />

===Foundation of Eggar's School (1640)===
Eggar's School was founded in 1640 by John Eggar of Moungomeries as the ''Free Grammar School''. It later became known as Eggar's Grammar School. It occupied a site in Anstey Road until it moved to a new site in [[Holybourne]] in 1969.<ref name="HCC">{{cite web | author=County Secretary| year=1989| title=Former Alton Eggars Grammar School premises — transfer of charitable trusts | work=Hampshire County Council Schools Sub-Committee | url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c1170.html | accessdate=2006-03-28}}</ref>

===The Battle of Alton (1643)===
:{{main|Battle of Alton}}
A battle was fought in Alton during the [[English Civil War]].  A small [[Cavaliers (royalists)|Royalist]] force were quartered in the town when on [[13 December]] [[1643]] they were surprised by a [[Parliamentary]] army of around 5,000 men. The Royalist [[cavalry]] fled, leaving Sir [[Richard Bolle]] and his [[infantry]] to fight.  Outnumbered, the Royalists were forced in St Lawrence Church, where Bolle was killed along with many of his men. Over 700 Royalist soldiers were captured and bullet holes from the battle are still visible in the church today.

===The plague (1665)===
In 1665, Alton suffered an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]], but soon recovered.<ref name="TimLambert">{{cite web | url=http://www.localhistories.org/alton.html | title=A History of Alton, England | author=Tim Lambert | work=Local and National Histories — Histories of British and Irish towns, Histories of Nations, Ancient Civilisations and Miscellaneous Articles | year=2001-6 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

===Fanny Adams (1867)===
:{{main|Fanny Adams}}
The [[Victorian era]] also left its mark when, on Saturday, [[August 24]], [[1867]] a young eight-year old girl  [[Fanny Adams]] was murdered. Her assailant Frederick Baker, a local solicitors clerk, was one of the last criminals to be executed in Winchester, and one of the original public notices advertising his forthcoming execution hangs in the Crown Public House. Fanny Adams' grave can still be seen in Alton cemetery. The brutal murder, so the story goes, coincided with the introduction of tinned meat in the [[Royal Navy]], and the sailors who did not like the new food said the tins contained the remains of "Sweet Fanny Adams", hence the expression which for over a century has meant "sweet nothing".

===Traditional industries in Alton===
[[Image:Hopfendolde-mit-hopfengarten.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Hops]]
[[Brewing]] used to be one of Alton's main industries. [[Hops]] and [[barley]] were grown in the surrounding area and the barley would have been [[malted]] in the town. The [[maltings]] still stand in Lower Turk Street, though it is no longer used for that purpose. They belonged to Halls Brewery from 1841 and were still producing malt in 1949.

There have been a number of breweries in Alton since 1763. Today, [[Coors Brewing Company]] (among the top ten largest brewers in the world) has a brewery in Alton which produces [[Carling]], [[Grolsch]] and Worthington.

Alton was also famous in the 18th century for the manufacture of paper<ref name="Alton2002" /> and of dress materials including ribbed [[drugget]]s, [[shallon]]s, [[silk]]s and [[serge]]s, [[bombazine]] and figured [[barragon]]s<ref name="HPoDHI">{{Harvard reference | Last=Wyatt | First=Sue (ed.) | Year=1997 | Title=The Hidden Places of Dorset, Hampshire & the Isle of Wight | Publisher=M & M Publishing Ltd | Place=Altrincham, Cheshire | Id=ISBN 1-871815-42-8 }}.</ref><ref name="GG">Brookes, R: 1815 (16th edn): General Gazetteer, The: (London)</ref>.
Alton today has thriving businesses in the retail and service sectors in the centre of the town, and over a hundred businesses in the four industrial areas of Mill Lane, Newman Lane, Caker Stream and Omega Park, ranging from light industrial to computer software production.<ref name="ACC">{{cite web|url=http://www.altonchamber.co.uk/industry.htm|title=Industrial Developments|work=Alton Chamber of Commerce & Industry|year=2006|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>

However, today, Alton's largest employer{{fact}} is probably not in the brewing or manufacturing industries, but in the financial services sector.  Lumbry Park, which used to be known as Lumbry Farm, is on the road from B3006 Alton to Selborne Road, and is occupied by Inter Group Insurance Services, a subsidiary of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].  Inter Group employs over 170 people on this site, and specialises in [[travel insurance]].

==Rail connections==

[[Alton railway station|Alton station]] is located on the [[National Rail]] network at the end of the [[Alton Line]] with a regular service to [[London Waterloo]]. Journey time is usually just over an hour, stopping at [[Bentley, Hampshire|Bentley]], [[Farnham]], [[Aldershot]], [[Ash Vale railway station|Ash Vale]], [[Brookwood, Surrey|Brookwood]] and [[Woking]]. 

[[Image:Mid-hants-watercress-railway.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Watercress Line]]
Alton railway station also serves as a terminal for the [[Mid Hants Railway]] commonly called 'The Watercress Line', a restored steam railway running between Alton and [[New Alresford]], so called because it used to be used to transport fresh [[watercress]] to London. 

The origins of the Watercress Line date back to 1861, the year in which [[Parliament]] granted consent for what was then known as the ''Alton, Alresford and Winchester Railway''. Four years later the Mid Hants Railway opened, and the train service continued until the line was closed in 1967. Then in 1973 the line was partially re-opened, in 1983 it was extended further, and in 1985 it was re-opened as far as Alton to connect with the mainline London service.

Alton used to be a fairly important railway junction. As well as the Mid-Hants Railway, from 1903 to 1965 the Meon Valley Railway ran from Alton down the [[River Meon|Meon Valley) to join the [[Eastleigh-Fareham Line]] at [[Fareham]]. There was also a (now closed) line north to [[Basingstoke]].
