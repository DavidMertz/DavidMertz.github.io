'''Nixa Record Company Ltd.''' was founded in [[1950]] by [[F. H. B. Nixon]]. Nixa was the second company, after [[Decca Records|Decca]], in Britain to release [[LP records]]. At the time, [[EMI]] was attempting to promote 45 rpm records over 33 LP records. The record label, which traded as ''Nixa Records'', was acquired by [[Pye]] in [[1953]].

Nixon's stepson, John M Reid (then also known as Nixon) was manager from 1950 until the company was sold to Pye in [[1953]]. Nixa Records was set up principally to market the catalogue of Compagnie General dur Disque, Paris, in [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries. The artists included, Dany Dauberson, Andr√© Claveau, and other continental caberet and jazz artists. The shellac records were pressed for Nixa by the Decca Record Company. Later, Nixa made licensing arrangements with a number of US classical music record companies, including, [[Period Records]], [[Concert Hall Records]], [[Haydn Society]], and [[Vanguard Records]] to manufacture and market their catalogues in UK and British Commonwealth. Nixa also made original recordings in England at the [[Walthamstow Assembly Hall]] of Sir [[Adrian Bolt]] conducting [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''The Planets Suite'', [[Vaughan Williams]] ''English Folksongs Suite'', and others. 

Their primary artist was [[Petula Clark]], who recorded for the label in both English and French from [[1955]] to [[1962]]. Many of her releases for the label were Top Ten hits in both the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]], with three of them charting at #1. 

In [[1987]], the Nixa name was reintroduced as a classical imprint by [[PRT Records]].
