{{Foreign Exchange}}
A '''floating currency''' is a [[currency]] that uses a [[floating exchange rate]] as its [[exchange rate regime]]. A floating currency is contrasted with a [[fixed currency]].

In the modern world, the majority of the world's currencies are floating, including the most widely traded currencies: the [[United States dollar]], the [[yen|Japanese yen]], the [[euro]], the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] and the [[Australian dollar]]. From 1946 to the early 1970s, the [[Bretton Woods system]] made fixed currencies the norm; however, in [[1971]], the [[United States]] government abandoned the [[gold standard]], so that the US dollar was no longer a fixed currency, and most of the world's currencies followed suit.

A floating currency is one where targets other than the exchange rate itself are used to administer monetary policy. See [[open market operation]]s. 

The [[People's Republic of China]] recently [[Renminbi#Exchange_rate|repegged their currency]], which was formerly affixed to the [[US dollar]].
