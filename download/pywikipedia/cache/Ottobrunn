'''Ottobrunn''' is a small suburban community south-east of [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], founded in 1955. It is located at {{coor dm|48|4|N|11|40|E|}}. Ottobrunn consists of mainly semi-detached and detached houses, and lots of gardens. The town's center was established in the mid 1980s with the town hall (1983) and the community centre (1986). The community centre was named after the German-Italian composer [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari]] who lived in Ottobrunn between 1915 and 1931. There is a [[Doric order]] [[Column]] made by the chiseler Anton Ripfel, remembering the day when [[Otto of Greece]] travelled past the present community area on his way to become king of [[Greece]]. Ottobrun is also the german Headquarter of the [[EADS]] (but technically, most of the ground area belongs to neighbouring community [[Taufkirchen (bei MÃ¼nchen)|Taufkirchen]])
