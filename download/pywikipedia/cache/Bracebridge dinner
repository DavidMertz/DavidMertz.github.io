'''Bracebridge dinner''' is an annual [[Christmas]] event held at [[Yosemite]]'s [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]. Started in [[1927]], the first year of operation for the Ahwahnee, the dinner is inspired by Squire Bracebridge's [[Yule]] celebration in a story from [[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon]] by [[Washington Irving]]. The event is a six course formal dinner presented as a feast held by a [[Victorian era]] lord. Music and acting are involved in the introduction of each course.

Dr. [[Donald Tresidder]], then president of Yosemite Park & Curry Co., had hired Garnet Holme to create the event for the grand dining room at the new hotel. Holme and his wife played the Squire and his lady for the first two years, until Holme's death in [[1929]]. Tresidder then asked [[Ansel Adams]], who had played a supporting role previously, to take on the direction of the show. Adams reworked the script considerably, taking the role of Squire, while his wife played the Housekeeper, a much more significant role than Lady Bracebridge.

The dinner was not held during [[World War II]], as the Ahwahnee was functioning as a military hospital. The [[1945]] dinner introduced a chorus and a more significant musical aspect. Ansel Adams retired from the event in [[1973]], passing it on to Eugene Fulton. Much of the cast returns year after year, ensuring a continuity of traditions. As of [[2004]], the longest running member of the cast is Andrea Fulton, daughter of Eugene. Andrea began performing in [[1950]] at the age of five, and now has the role of Housekeeper.

For much of its history tickets to the show were difficult to obtain. Prior to [[1956]] it was a single show, but the number of performances has gradually increased to a total of eight in [[2002]] (and currently) so that it no longer sells out in a single day or week.
