'''Eggo''' products, known for its slogan “L’Eggo my Eggo” (Company History 1), is the number one brand of frozen [[waffles]] in the United States. The brand was created by Kellogg Company (Company History 1) in [[1936]]. Kellogg’s originated in Battle Creek, [[Michigan]], where its headquarters are still located, as the “Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company” (Company History 1). [http://investor.kelloggs.com/history.cfm>] The city, home to an estimated 54,000 people and located halfway between Detroit and Chicago, is one of the largest in Michigan. In “Fortune” magazine, J.S. stated that Eggo has a 65% share of the frozen waffle market (2). [http://search.epnet.com/] There are now about a dozen established Eggo waffle flavors, including [[strawberry]], cinnamon toast, [[buttermilk]], homestyle, [[blueberry]], [[chocolate chip]], and apple cinnamon. However, Eggo has developed into more than just a successful frozen waffle brand. Today, Eggo makes syrup, pancakes, toaster swirls and cinnamon rolls as well. 

When Eggo wanted to become more kid-friendly, it launched new Eggo Waffle flavors, such as Eggo Froot Loop Waffles, [[Spider-Man]], [[SpongeBob]], and an in-and-out Eggo [[Scooby-Doo]] Waffle, with wild berry flavored bits in a homestyle batter and [[Scooby-Doo]] imprinted on each waffle (S 2). [http://search.epnet.com/] In May of 1996, when Kellogg’s extended its longtime partnership with [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] and its parent [[Viacom]] in five separate promotions (Spethmann 2) [http://search.epnet.com/], Eggo Waffles carried a mail-in offer for a mini-snake light, a spy device used in the movie [[Harriet the Spy]]. When Eggo wanted to be more appealing to adults, it paired together with the [[Nutri-Grain]] cereal line and created three new Eggo Waffles, one of these being the [[Special K]] waffle, a low-carb frozen waffle containing 4 net carbs (S 2). [http://search.epnet.com/] In November of 2000, Eggo [[Nutri-Grain]] Whole [[Wheat]] Waffles with the manufacturing code of 06300EJB on the end of the box underwent a voluntary recall due to an allergy alert (Peanut Alert 2). [http://search.epnet.com/]  These boxes may have contained another waffle with [[peanuts]]. Eggo’s fastest launch in history was in January of 2005, when it launched Eggo Toaster Swirlz™, a type of mini [[cinnamon rolls]] (S 2). [http://search.epnet.com/]
     
There are a couple of recent additions to the Eggo Waffle family. One of these is Flip Flop™ Choco-'Nilla. These are round waffles with [[chocolate]] on one side and [[vanilla]] on the other that are packaged in a box of eight. Eggo Waf-fulls, an “all-in-one” Eggo Waffle with a layer of filling on the inside, is another. Waf-fulls are available in [[strawberry]], apple-cinnamon, [[blueberry]], and maple flavors.

In addition to waffles, Eggo also manufactures [[syrup]], french toast sticks, Toaster Swirlz™, and now [[cereal]].  According to Sonia Reyes (2), [http://search.epnet.com/] $27 million was spent on the ad effort when Eggo launched its new [[syrup]] in 2003. Eggo Syrup, maple flavored with natural and artificial flavors, comes in a 23 fl. oz., eleven-serving [[waffle]]-shaped [[bottle]] with a no-drip spout. It is available in three flavors: original, buttery, and lite. In January of 2004, in order to provide a healthy and easy-to-prepare [[breakfast]], Eggo introduced [[French Toast]] Sticks (Reyes 2). [http://search.epnet.com/] The three initial flavors were [[original]], [[buttermilk]], and [[cinnamon]].  Later that year two new [[berry]]-flavored [[french toast]] sticks were added. These are packaged as thirty-two sticks and contain thirty percent less fat than [[General Mills]]'s version.  Eggo Toaster Swirlz™ are mini [[rolls]] available in cinnamon roll and [[strawberry]] flavors.  There are four attached cinnamon rolls, with the [[icing (food)|icing]] already baked inside, which you pop in the [[toaster]]. These are packaged as eight sets of four rolls.  In 2006, [[Eggo Cereal]] was released, a crunchy waffle-shaped cereal available in maple syrup and cinnamon toast flavors.

==Commercials==

===Eggo Suit Man===
Most Comercials of Eggo Waffles so far include a walking waffle man with red arms and legs that makes wierd noises. There are always traps set up so that the humans can capture him and eat him, such as trap doors or hidden forks or spoons. In most commercials, he ends up getting caught in the traps, and then the human appears cutting a real Eggo Waffle (which is supposed to be the walking Eggo Suit Man), saying "Gotcha!" or something else like that.
