'''Laron-type dwarfism''' is characterized by low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) hormone.  [[Growth hormone]] secretion remains normal.  However, due to growth hormone receptor insensitivity, overall growth and development is impaired.  Individuals with [[dwarfism]] have physical traits of short stature and obesity.
