'''UDON Entertainment Corporation''' is a studio (or "art collective") of [[Asia]]n-influenced [[comic book creator]]s. Erik Ko is its Chief of Operations. It appears to have begun operations in March [[2001]]. It was affiliated with [[Studio XD]]; in March [[2004]], UDON announced a partnership with [[Devil's Due Publishing]].

Recently, UDON has been on hiatus while it reorganizes its operations and prepares to become a full-fledged publisher in [[October]] [[2005]]. Erik Ko revealed that the lengthy break in the Summer of 2005 was to recover from a licensing deal with [[Capcom]], which saw UDON doing artwork for ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]''. Although UDON appreciated the opportunity to work on the game, and to strengthen their ties with the video game maker; it taxed their resources, and left them behind schedule on their comics. In October 2005, UDON released ''Street Fighter II #0'', the sequel to their ''Street Fighter'' comic; it will be followed in early [[2006]] with the long awaited launch of ''[[Rival Schools]]'' and the relaunch of ''Darkstalkers''. Erik Ko discusses this in an interview with [[Newsarama]] that can be read [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=41089 here].
