'''''Strange''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] drama series, produced by the independent production company [[Big Bear Productions]] for the [[BBC]], which aired on the [[BBC One]] channel. It consists of a single one-hour pilot episode screened in March [[2002]], followed by a series of six one-hour episodes broadcast in the summer of [[2003]]. 

The series follows former priest John Strange ([[Richard Coyle]]), dismissed from the clergy under mysterious circumstances. He was implicated in a number of gruesome murders, murders that he says were done by demons. Now he seeks those responsible and to clear his name. To help him in his hunt for demons, John has Toby ([[Andrew Lee-Potts]]), a technological expert who is in charge of the equipment John uses to sense the presence of demons, and Kevin ([[Timmy Lang]]). Kevin can sense the presence of demons and is often an early warning that something supernatural is about to happen in the area. Jude ([[Samantha Janus]]), a former scientist who works as a nurse, is interested because she found out that her partner Rich was a demon. With Rich dead her main concern is that the son they had together, Joey, could also be a demon. With her own agenda for uncovering the truth, Jude joins forces with John Strange. John's mission also involves Canon Black ([[Ian Richardson]]), who seems intent on denying any acknowledgement of dark forces in his diocese. 

All seven episodes of the series were written by [[Andrew Marshall (writer)|Andrew Marshall]], a scriptwriter primarily known for his comedy work. It was directed by [[Joe Ahearne]], who had previously been responsible for both writing and directing the [[World Productions]] vampire serial ''[[Ultraviolet (TV serial)|Ultraviolet]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. Broadcast on Saturday nights, the series was hampered by frequent timeslot changes, the long gap between the pilot and the series and the BBC's decision not to repeat the pilot before the series aired. The viewing figures were low, and a second series was not commissioned.

In the [[United States]], ''Strange'' has been broadcast by the [[cable television]] network [[Showtime]], on one of its specialist subsidiary channels.

In 2006, the [[Sci Fi Channel (United Kingdom)|UK Sci-Fi Channel]] repeated all seven episodes of ''Strange''.
