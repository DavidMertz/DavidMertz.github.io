{{about|the Boy Scout program within the BSA|the national organization|Boy Scouts of America}}
'''Boy Scouting''' is one of the traditional membership divisions of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA), available to boys 10&ndash;17. It is the oldest division of the three Scouting programs ([[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]], Boy Scouting, and [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]) from the BSA. The program is part of the worldwide [[Scouting|Scout]] movement and uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities among youth.

The program had an estimated registration of 61,495 in 1911.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.boyscoutstuff.com/timeline.html | title =Boy Scouting in America: The First Decade | format = | work =A Virtual Boy Scout Museum | publisher = | accessdate =March 28 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> As of the end of 2005, the Boy Scout program was serving 879,789 Boy Scouts with 543,971 troop level leaders in 42,811 troops.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/media/review/2005.html | title =Year in Review: 2005 | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =July 19 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>   Boy Scouts are sometimes referred to as ''Scouts'', or more commonly just as ''boys''.  Adults who participate in the organization are called ''Scouters''. Boy Scouts are organized into ''troops''  and use the [[Scout method]] to instill values such as self-esteem, good citizenship, outdoors appreciation of the outdoors through a variety of outdoor activities such as [[camping]], [[aquatics]], and [[hiking]]. Scouts are recognized for their achievements through an advancement system that includes many special awards and programs.

==Ideals==
Boy Scouts express their ideals through verbal statements of principles, which Scouts must memorize and understand.  They also represent these ideals symbolically in official emblems. The Boy Scout ideals are spelled out in the Scout Law, the Scout Oath, the Scout Motto and the Scout Slogan. Each Scout learns to use these ideals as a measure of personal growth.<ref>{{cite web | author = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-503.html | title = What Is Boy Scouting? | format = | work = BSA Fact Sheet | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 27 February | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

;The Scout Law
A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.

;The Scout Oath
:On my honor I will do my best
:to do my duty to God and my country
:and to obey the Scout Law;
:to help other people at all times;
:to keep myself physically fit,
:mentally awake, and morally straight.

;The Scout Motto
:Be Prepared.

;The Scout Slogan
:Do a Good Turn Daily.

;The Outdoor Code
:As an American, I will do my best to
:be clean in my outdoor manners,
:be careful with fire,
:be considerate in the outdoors,
:and to be conservation-minded.

The Scout Sign identifies the youth as a Boy Scout and is used when giving the Scout Law or the Scout Oath. The [[Three-finger salute (scouts)|Scout Salute]] is used when saluting the [[flag of the United States]]. The left-handed [[handshake]] is used as a token of [[friendship]] and identity.

[[Image:BSA First Class Scout emblem.gif|thumb|100px|First Class]]
===Emblems===
The rank advancements use a series of medals and patches emblematic of the Scouting program. The basic Scout badge uses the [[fleur-de-lis]], symbolizing a [[compass]] needle, pointing the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend that freedom. The Second Class badge has a scroll with the ends turned up and inscribed with the Scout Motto, and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom: the knot is a reminder for each Scout to remember the Scout slogan and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines the elements of the Scout, Tenderfoot and Second Class badges.  For many years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA.  Star is a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank.  Life is a First Class symbol on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first aid and health related merit badges required for the rank.

==Organization==
===Troop===
The troop is the fundamental unit of the Boy Scouts.  It may include as few as a dozen boys, or as many as seventy or more.  Troops usually meet weekly. Each troop is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartering organization is responsible for providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. A chartered organization representative manages the relationship between the troop, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

====Patrol====
Each troop is divided into patrols of six to ten Scouts.  A patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities.  For instance, a troop typically holds ordinary meetings as a unit.  Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own cooking area.  However, on a high-adventure trip which only a small part of the troop attends, divisions between patrols may disappear entirely.  Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop, but this is more common in some troops than in others.

Some troops mix older and younger Scouts in the same patrols, so that the older boys can teach the younger ones more effectively.  Other troops group boys by age, and may assign an older boy as a "troop guide" to mentor each of the younger patrols.

====Venture patrol====
[[Image:venturestrip.jpg|right|75px|Venture patrol tab]]
:''The Venture patrol should not be confused with [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]], the program for young men and women ages 14&ndash;21.''
Some troops establish ''Venture'' patrols as an optional program for boys 13&ndash;17 years old.  Venture patrols experience more autonomy from the troop than ordinary patrols, and provide older Scouts with expanded social contact and physical challenges. The program is based on high adventure or sports activities. The patrol is guided by the assistant Scoutmaster-Venture who is resposible to the Scoutmaster for Venture patrol activities. Venture patrol members wear the standard [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]] with the Venture strip over the right pocket. Patrol members are Boy Scouts and should never be referred to as Venture Scouts.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/identity/los/los.jsp?typ=los&how=alfa&wat=V | title = Scouting Terms and Style| format = | work =The Language of Scouting | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>

===Lone Scout===
[[Image:LoneScoutLogo.gif|right|75px|Lone Scout logo]]
The Lone Scout program serves boys who cannot take part in a nearby troop on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties. While the boy does not participate in troop or patrol activities, he does learn the fun, values, and achievements of Scouting.<ref>{{cite web | author = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-515.html | title = BSA Fact Sheet: What Is the Lone Scout Plan? | format = | work = | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 7 February | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Varsity Scouts===
[[Image:BSA Varsity logo.png|right|75px|Varsity Scout logo]]
:{{main|Varsity Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)}}
'''Varsity Scouts''' are part of the Boy Scout program division of the BSA. It is an alternative program available to boys from 14&ndash;17 that takes the basic Boy Scout program and adds high adventure and sporting activities to be more appealing to older youth. Varsity Scouts are organized into teams, which are separate chartered units from a Boy Scout troop.

===Order of the Arrow===
[[Image:OA-logo.jpg|right|75px|The OA Logo]]
:{{main|Order of the Arrow}}
The '''Order of the Arrow''' ('''OA''') is a program of the Boy Scout division of the BSA. It is the BSA's national [[honor society]] for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service. Scouts and Scouters must belong to a troop or team to become OA members. The OA is a youth-run organization, with adult Scouters serving as advisors. In the OA, a youth is a member under 21 years of age.

==Leadership in the troop==
Every troop has two separate leadership structures: one consisting of Scouts and another consisting of adults.  The adult leadership manages the logistics of troop activities, administers rank advancement and awards, maintains troop records and finance, and recruits new Scouts and adult leaders.  The youth leadership keeps order and coordinates labor at activities.  Scouts and adults cooperate to plan agendas for troop meetings, as well as the troop's schedule of outings.

===Adult leadership===
Responsible local adults, approved by both the local council and the chartering institution,  may join the troop committee. Typically, many of these are parents of the Scouts.  The committee, in turn, selects a chair and appoints its members to specific tasks, as well as selecting the Scoutmaster and his assistants.  These "commissioned" leaders must also be approved by by both the local council and the chartered institution and complete special training mandated by BSA (see [[#Training|Training]] below).  

The Scoutmaster must be at least 21 and is directly responsible for training and guiding the boy leaders, working with other adults to bring Scouting to boys, and for using the methods of Scouting to achieve the aims of Scouting.

===Youth leadership===
The youth leadership is headed by a senior patrol leader (SPL), who works closely with the Scoutmaster to run troop activities.  He is expected to attend most meetings and outings.  The SPL shares responsibility with one or more assistants (ASPL).  The SPL is elected by the entire troop, with requirements and from a list of candidates approved by the Scoumaster.  Likewise, each patrol elects a Patrol Leader (PL), who appoints an assistant patrol leader (APL).  The patrol leaders council (PLC) consists of the SPL, ASPL, PLs and the troop guides of any new-Scout patrol.  The PLC determines the requirements and tenure for youth leaders.  Other troop-wide positions of responsibility include: troop guide, Order of the Arrow troop representative, den chief, scribe, librarian, historian, quartermaster, junior assistant Scoutmaster, chaplain aide and instructor.<ref>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =1998 | title =The Scoutmaster Handbook | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | location = | id =ISBN 0-8935-3009-9 }}</ref>

==Uniform==
The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]] is worn by Scouts and adult leaders. The official cap is olive green with a red front panel and a Scout emblem. The troop may also choose the [[campaign hat]], but today these are seen mostly in historical troops (i.e. pre-[[World War II]]), and by leaders in a training course. Many troops elect to create custom caps.

A variety of official neckerchiefs are available or the troop can create their own design. Many troops now opt not to wear a neckerchief. Special neckerchiefs such as [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] or [[Wood Badge]] are generally worn on formal occasions. Insignia such as sashes, medals, and pins are generally only worn only on formal occasions.

The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Scouter dress uniform|Scouter dress uniform]] is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.

Boy Scouts has seven ranks, grouped into two phases. The first phase of 
Scout,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank1.html | title =Boy Scout Joining Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> Tenderfoot,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank2.html | title =Tenderfoot Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> Second Class,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank3.html | title =Second Class Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> and First Class 
is designed to teach the boy [[Scoutcraft]] skills, teamwork, and self-reliance.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank4.html | title =First Class Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> Scout is the first rank, awarded when a boy first joins the Scouts, and requires just a rudimentary knowledge of Scouting's ideals.  Further ranks have progessively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and [[Scout Spirit]]. Scouts with a permanent mental or physical disability may use alternate requirements, based on their abilities and approved by the council.

The second phase of 
Star,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank5.html | title =Star Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> Life,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank6.html | title =Life Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref> and Eagle 
is designed to develop leadership skills and encourage the Scout to explore potential vocations and avocations through the [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badge]] program.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank7.html | title =Eagle Rank Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate =March 23 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>  These ranks require that the boy serve in a position of responsibility and perform [[community service]].

:{{details|Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle}}
The Eagle Scout requires, in addition to merit badges and a position of responsibility, a community service project planned and led entirely by the Eagle Scout candidate. After attaining the rank of Eagle, a Scout may earn Eagle Palms for additional tenure and merit badges.

Although Eagle is the highest rank, for which all Scouts should strive, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness. Studies have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in the Scout program for at least three years. Scouts who do so are more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of "producing useful citizens".

===Awards===
Several programs of [[List of BSA religious emblems|religious awards]] are administered by various religious institutions and recognized by the BSA. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot. Many other [[Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America|advancement and recognitions]]&mdash;such as the [[50-miler award]], Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award &mdash;are available to Scouts who show performance in special areas.

===Recognition for adult leaders===
Boy Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Scouters Training Award is available to any leader, while the Scouter's Key and Scoutmaster Award of Merit are only available to the Scoutmaster.  The pinnacle of Scout leader training is [[Wood Badge]], for which successful participants receive a special [[neckerchief]], [[woggle]], and special wooden beads.

==Program and activities==
Each troop plans and conducts its own activities, but all troops' programs have some similarities.

Troops typically hold meetings once a week, though some do not meet during the summer. The activities conducted at troop meetings vary widely, from training in Scout skills to planning [[camping (recreation)|camping]] trips to playing [[game]]s. Patrol meetings may be held independently of troop meetings to conduct patrol business, such as creating a patrol [[flag]]. Most patrols do not hold regular meetings independently of the troop, but some go so far as to organize their own outings. Patrol activities are planned by the patrol leader.

Troops also typically hold excursions once a month or more, which usually involve [[camping (recreation)|camping]] overnight. These outings are an important place for Scouts to work on skills and rank advancement, have fun, and engage in productive outdoor activities. Aside from simple camping trips, common excursions include [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[canoeing]], and [[hiking]] trips. Less-common activities include [[rafting]], [[climbing]], [[spelunking]], and [[abseil|rappelling]].

Most councils own and operate one or more permanent camps. These camps host a variety of activities throughout the year, but are most heavily used during the summer, when troops visit for a week at a time. A typical camp might host ten troops at once. Summer camps are important places to earn merit badges, particularly those that require special facilities, such as [[archery]], and to participate in high-adventure activities. Purely recreational activities are also available, and most camps offer day-long overnight side trips. Troops may choose to attend the summer camp operated by their own council, or one belonging to another council.

It is common for several troops within a district or council to gather at least once a year at a special weekend campout called a [[camporee]]. A camporee is a district- or council-wide event where several units camp and engage in activities, competitions, and learn specialized skills. Competitions typically include [[knot]] tying, [[flagpole]] raising, flag ceremony, and [[orienteering]], but many camporees emphasize specific themes. Some troops prepare for camporee more intensively than others, and the highest awards usually go to troops that make camporee their first priority.

Some councils hold "jamborees" or "camporalls", which are similar to camporees, but occur less often and draw troops from a broader area.  The [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|National Scout jamboree]] usually occurs every four years, and draws more than 30,000 Scouts from across the country and the world.  The last one took place in 2005, at [[Fort A.P. Hill]] in Virginia, and the next one will occur in 2010 (postponed to coincide with BSA's centennial).

==Training==
New leaders are encouraged to attend training for their position.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/18-390/ | title = Every Boy Deserves a Trained Leader | format = | work = | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 8 March | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> This training provides the essential information they need to provide a safe and successful quality program.

Fast Start Training is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Boy Scout program. Fast Start is self pace and provided as a video or online.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://olc.scouting.org/ | title = Boy Scout Leader Fast Start | format = | work =BSA Online Learning Center | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and must be recertified per local council policy.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://olc.scouting.org/ | title = Youth Protection Training | format = | work =BSA Online Learning Center | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = May 17 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Basic Leader Training consists of New Leader Essentials, Scoutmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster Specific Training, and Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills. New Leader Essentials is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Boy Scouts of America. Scoutmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster Specific Training gives the Scoutmaster or assistant Scoutmaster the needed program knowledge. Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills gives the adult leaders needed camping/outdoor skills and knowledge. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a "Trained" emblem for uniform wear.

Supplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a University of Scouting program offered by the local councils and at National Training Conferences held at the [[Philmont Training Center]] and the [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/supplemental/index.html | title = Supplemental Training Modules | format = | work = | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 8 March | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> 

[[Wood Badge]] is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, [[neckerchief]], and [[woggle]].

The Scoutmaster provides initial youth leader training within at the troop level. Youth leaders are encouraged to attend [[National Youth Leadership Training]] at the district or council level.
