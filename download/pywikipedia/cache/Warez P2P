Released in January of 2004, '''Warez P2P''' is a proprietary [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] [[filesharing]] service that uses the [[Ares Galaxy#The Ares network|Ares network]], and offers a service similar to that of [[Kazaa]]. Up to version 1.6, Warez P2P was a clone of [[Ares Galaxy]], created by Italian developer Alberto Trevisan, but since then has been developed independently by Neoteric Ltd.

==Warez P2P service==
Warez P2P claims that it has faster download times than [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]] networks due to a better implemented multi-sourced swarm downloading technology, no [[spyware]], faster and more complete searches than other [[file-sharing]] programs. It also has chat rooms which are shared with all clients of the Ares network.

Warez P2P hosted on the warezclient.com website, is enthusiastically touted by the website as a spyware and adware free filesharing service, however some users report that [[adware]] is present inside at least the free version of the program.<ref>http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/warezclient.com/summary/</ref>  As of December 2006, Warez P2P claims to be the third largest decentralized, proprietary P2P [[filesharing]] network with over 1.5 million simultaneous online users.<ref>http://www.warez.com/content/docs/about/corporate.html</ref>  With an arguably dubious name though, the future of Warez P2P remains in question as long as the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and other recording industry bodies increase legal action against P2P filesharing networks.<ref>http://www.slyck.com/story1368.html</ref>

== Alternatives ==
There are two alternative stand-alone clients that connect to the Ares network. [[Ares Galaxy]] is a free [[open source]] from which Warez P2P is based off of. [[KCeasy]] is also a free open source software released under the [[GNU General Public License]] that connects to the Ares network in addition to the [[OpenFT]] and [[Gnutella]] networks.
