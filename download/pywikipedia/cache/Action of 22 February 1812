This naval battle took place on [[22 February]] [[1812]] near Grado in the Adriatic Sea.

The new French battleship ''Rivoli'' 74, built at [[Venice]], was making its first trip in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. It was accompanied by the French brig ''Mercure'' 16, the Italian brigs ''Iena'' 16 and ''Mamalucco'' 8 and 2 small craft.

On 21 February 1812 the British battleship [[HMS Victorious (1808)|''Victorious'']] 74 and ''Weazel'' 18, which were heading to Venice to intercept ''Rivoli'', encountered the Allied vessels and gave chase. On the 22nd they caught up near Grado.

''Mercure'' quickly blew up after being fired on by ''Weazel'' and the 4 remaining smaller vessels fled. ''Victorious'' and ''Rivoli'' then had a 4-1/2 hour duel, joined in the last hour by ''Weazel'' before ''Rivoli'' surrendered. It had sustained almost 400 casualties. ''Victorious'' had 27 killed and 99 wounded, while ''Weazel'' had no casualties.
