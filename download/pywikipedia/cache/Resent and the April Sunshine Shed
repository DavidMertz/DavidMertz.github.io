'''''Resent and the April Sunshine Shed''''' is the fourth official full-length release from [[electronic music]] [[Record producer|producer]] [[Benn Jordan]] as [[The Flashbulb]]. 

Released right in the beginning of the [[summer]] of [[2003]], this album can be immediately credited as being Jordan's most organic, relaxed and "warm" sounding work yet. This is partly evidenced by the album's significantly, consistently longer (''for Jordan, at least'') running track times. Acting as sort of his [[musical instrument|instrument]]-based "coming-out party", this album features a bevy of new instrumentation added to Jordan's list of regularly employed gear. Jordan's music has always had inflicted overtones of acoustic and [[electric guitar]] and [[bass guitar]] in it, but many more peripherals came into play during the recording of this album, including live [[drums]], [[cello]], [[turntables]]/[[scratching]], unusual, [[India]]n-style singing, real [[grand piano]] (''as opposed to the electronic [[Keyboard synthesizer|keyboard]]s he had used up until this point''), a renewed emphasis on warm analogue [[synth]] tones, and especially the [[sitar]]. 

This does not necessarily mean the level of scrutiny at which Jordan treats his productions has downgraded at all, however. There are just as many classic, hectic, glitchy tracks for which Jordan has now become idolized over (''such as "Transient Skip" or the acid workout "Level Two Hundred"'') that reside in the track listing. [[Genre]]s that are touched upon over the course of this album include [[downtempo]] (''along with more use of looped drum breaks that sustain a feel rather than mechanical, emotionless [[IDM]] beatscapes''), [[bossa nova]], [[acid house]] and [[european classical music|classical]].

As the first ''official'' release of Jordan's label [[Alphabasic]] (''possessing the catalogue number alph001''), ''Resent...'' is a bit of an experimental [[enhanced CD]], featuring an interactive menu that pops up when the disc is placed in a [[IBM PC clone|PC]] that contains five previously unreleased ''Resent...'' era tracks that can be freely extracted, wallpapers, contact info, and a music video for a song called ''Autumn Windows''.

Jordan usually does all of the art direction of his albums himself, and in that sense this album was another big step up for him, revolving around an elaborate conceptual theme rather than being simplistic. He would again return to such sophisticated heights of art direction in [[Kirlian Selections]].
