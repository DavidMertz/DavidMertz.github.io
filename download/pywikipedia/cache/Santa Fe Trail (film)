'''''Santa Fe Trail''''' is a [[1940 in film|1940]] [[Western (genre)|western]] film directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] and starring [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Despite glaring historical inaccuracies, the film was one of the top-grossing films of the year, being the seventh Flynn-de Havilland collaboration. The film also has nothing to do with its namesake, the famed [[Santa Fe Trail]]. Instead, it follows the life of [[J.E.B. Stuart|Jeb Stuart]], a [[cavalry]] commander (and future [[Confederate Army]] general). The film entered the [[public domain]] in the mid-[[1990s]].

Among its sub-plots include a romance with the fictional Kit Carson Holliday ([[Olivia de Havilland]]), friendship with [[George Armstrong Custer]] ([[Ronald Reagan]]), and battles against [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] ([[Raymond Massey]]).
