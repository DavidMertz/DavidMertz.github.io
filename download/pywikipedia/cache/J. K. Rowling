'''Joanne <!--Her name does not contain "Kathleen"; please see the section entitled "Her Name" -->"Jo" Rowling''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born [[31 July]] [[1965]]{{ref|Lexicon-muggle-y}}) is an [[England|English]] fiction writer who writes under the [[pen name]] of '''J. K. Rowling'''{{ref|Lexicon-books}} [[#Her name|(see below)]]. Rowling became famous as [[author]] of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' [[fantasy]] series, which has gained international attention, won multiple awards, and sold over 300 million copies worldwide{{ref|Contemporary}}. In [[February 2004]], ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated her fortune at [[GBP|£]]576 million (just over [[USD|US$]]1 billion), making her the first person ever to become a $US billionaire by writing books{{ref|Watson}}. The [[asteroid]] [[(43844) Rowling]] was named in her honour in early 2006.{{ref|asteroid}}

==Early life==
Joanne Rowling was born in [[South Gloucestershire]], [[England]] on [[31 July]], [[1965]]{{ref|Lexicon-muggle-y}}, on the outskirts of [[Bristol]]{{ref|Rowling-bio}}. There is some confusion as to exactly where; Rowling has said she was born in [[Chipping Sodbury]], whereas her birth certificate apparently claims she was born in the Cottage Hospital at [[Yate]]. The hospital is called Chipping Sodbury Hospital, but is actually in Yate.{{ref|Lexicon-muggle-y}}. Her sister Dianne was born when Rowling was almost two {{ref|Rowling-bio}}. The family moved to [[Winterbourne]], [[Bristol]] when Rowling was four, and then to [[Tutshill]], near [[Chepstow]], [[Wales]] at the age of nine{{ref|Rowling-bio}}. She attended secondary school at [[Wyedean School and College]]. In December 1990, Rowling's mother succumbed to a decade-long battle with [[multiple sclerosis]]{{ref|Rowling-bio}}.

After studying [[French language|French]] and [[Classics]] at the [[University of Exeter]], with a year of study in [[Paris]], she moved to [[London]] to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for [[Amnesty International]]. During this period she had the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry while she was on a four-hour, delayed train trip between [[Manchester]] and [[London]]{{ref|Rowling-bio}}. When she had reached her destination, she began writing immediately {{ref|Rowling-bio}}.

Rowling then moved to [[Portugal]] to teach English as a foreign language. While there, she married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes on [[16 October]] [[1992]]{{ref|About-jkr}}. They had one child, Jessica Isabel, before divorcing in 1993{{ref|Rowling-bio}}. Their daughter was named after Rowling's heroine, [[Jessica Mitford]]{{ref|Weeks}}. 

In December, 1994, she and her daughter moved to be near her sister in [[Edinburgh]]{{ref|Rowling-bio}}. Unemployed and living on state benefits, she completed her first novel, doing some of the work in local Edinburgh cafes whenever she could get Jessica to fall asleep{{ref|Rowling-bio}}{{ref|HPandme}}. There was a rumour that she wrote in local cafés in order to escape from her unheated flat, but in a 2001 BBC interview Rowling remarked, ''"I am not stupid enough to rent an unheated flat, in Edinburgh, in mid-winter; it had heating"''{{ref|HPandme}}.

==Harry Potter==
[[Image:Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.jpg|thumb|200px|The first ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novel]]
{{main|Harry Potter}}

===Harry Potter books===
In [[1995]], Rowling completed her manuscript for ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' on an old manual typewriter{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evans, a young reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based [[Christopher Little Literary Agents]] agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was handed to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected it. {{ref|Scotsman}}. A year later she was finally given the greenlight (and a £1500 advance) by the editor Barry Cunningham from the small publisher Bloomsbury{{ref|Barnes-bio}}{{ref|Scotsman}}. Although Cunningham happily agreed to publish the book, he claims he advised her to get a day job, as she had little chance of making money in children's books.{{ref|wkyc}} She then received an £8000 grant from the [[Scottish Arts Council]] to enable her to continue writing{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}} {{ref|SAC}}. The following spring, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc, who paid Rowling more than $100,000. Rowling has said she "nearly died" when she heard the news{{ref|Veritaserum-book1}}. In June, 1997, Bloomsbury published ''Philosopher's Stone'' with an intial print run of only 1000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued at between £16,000 and £25,000 each. {{ref|Metroactive}} Five months later it won its first award, a [[Nestle Smarties Book Prize]]. In February, the novel won the prestigious [[British Book Award]] for Children's Book of the Year, and, later the Children's Book Award. In October 1998, Scholastic published ''Philosopher's Stone'' in the States under the title of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'', a change Rowling now claims she regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time. {{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}{{ref|darkmark-BBC}}. 

In December 1999, the third ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', won the Smarties Prize, in the process making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. She later withdrew the fourth ''Harry Potter'' novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January, 2000, ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it narrowly lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of ''[[Beowulf]]''{{ref|Gibbons}}. That June, the Queen honored Rowling by making her an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]]{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. 

To date, six of the seven volumes of the ''Harry Potter'' series, one for each of Harry's school years, have already been published and all have broken sales records. Upon its publication, both the fourth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', and the sixth, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', were the fastest-selling books in history{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}{{ref|eonline}}. 

Rowling is currently writing the seventh and [[Harry Potter: Book Seven|final book]] of the series. Its title is currently unknown.{{ref|Book-Seven-Title}}

===Harry Potter films===
In October, [[1998]], [[Warner Brothers]] purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. A film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' was released on [[November 16]], [[2001]] and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' on [[November 15]], [[2002]]{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. Both were directed by [[Chris Columbus]]{{ref|film1-imdb}}{{ref|film2-imdb}}. The [[June 4]], [[2004]] film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' was directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]]{{ref|film3-imdb}}{{ref|Lexicon-timeline-books}}. The fourth film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', was directed by yet another new director, [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. A film of [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] is now in production, under British television director [[David Yates]], and new screenwriter [[Michael Goldenberg]], projected for release on July 13, 2007{{ref|film4-imdb}}{{ref|film5-imdb}}.

The first four films were scripted by [[Steve Kloves]]; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series. She says she has told him more about the later books than anybody else, but not everything{{ref|Mzimba}}. She has also said that she has told [[Alan Rickman]] and [[Robbie Coltrane]] certain secrets about their characters that have not yet been revealed{{ref|JKR-fans}}. [[Steven Spielberg]] was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated on her website that she has no say in who directs the films.{{ref|Spielberg}}

==After Harry Potter==
Harry Potter has made Rowling a well known and a very successful author, but after Rowling finishes the final Harry Potter book, she plans to continue writing, possibly using a pen name.{{ref|Fry}}

In 2006, Rowling revealed that she had completed a few short stories and another children's book (a "political fairy story") about a monster, aimed at a younger audience than Harry Potter readers{{ref|rediff}}.

She is not planning to write an eighth Harry Potter book, but has suggested she might publish an "encyclopaedia" of the Harry Potter world consisting of all her unpublished material and notes. Any profits from such a book would be given to charity. {{ref|afterpotter}}

==Her name==
Rowling's full name is "Joanne Rowling", not, as is often assumed, "Joanne Kathleen Rowling". Before publishing her first volume, [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|Bloomsbury]] feared that the target group of young boys might be reluctant to buy books written by a female author. They requested that Rowling use two initials, rather than reveal her first name. As she had no middle name, she chose K from her grandmother's name Kathleen, as the second initial of her pseudonym. The name Kathleen has never been part of her legal name.{{ref|darkmark-BBC}} She calls herself "Jo" and claims, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."{{ref|CBC-1}} Her [[surname]] is pronounced like "rolling" (IPA: {{IPA|/rəʊ.lɪŋ/}}).{{ref|Not}}

==Current life and family==
In 2001, Rowling purchased a luxurious 19th-century [[estate house]], Killiechassie House, on the banks of the [[River Tay]], near [[Aberfeldy, Scotland|Aberfeldy]], in [[Perth and Kinross]], Scotland{{ref|Lexicon-muggle-k}}. Rowling also owns a home in [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]], Edinburgh, and a [[Georgian style]] house in London, on a street where, according to ''The Guardian'', the average price of a house is £4.27 million ($11 million), possibly including an underground swimming pool and 24-hour security {{ref|Collinson}}.

On 26 December 2001, Rowling married Dr. Neil Murray, an [[anaesthetist]], in a private ceremony at her home in Aberfeldy{{ref|Lexicon-muggle-k}}. Their son David Gordon Rowling Murray was born shortly after Rowling began writing ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', and Rowling took a break from working on the novel to care for him in his early infancy {{ref|jkr-os-progress}}. Rowling's youngest child, Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, was born in January of 2005 {{ref|jkr-os-gives}}.

==Charity==
All proceeds from the sales of ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' go to the UK [[Comic Relief]] charity{{ref|Lexicon-qa}}.

Rowling has contributed money and support to many other charitable causes, especially research and treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]], from which her mother died in [[1990]]. This death heavily affected her writing, according to Rowling{{ref|jkr-os-ms}}{{ref|Greig}}.

In January 2006, Rowling went to [[Bucharest]] to raise funds for the Children's High Level Group, an organization devoted to enforcing the human rights of children, particularly in eastern Europe. {{ref|jkr-os-Launch}}

==Television==
[[Image:Jo_simpsons.jpg|right|thumb|Rowling on ''[[The Simpsons]]''.]]
Rowling made a guest appearance as herself on the American cartoon show ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in a special British-themed episode entitled ''[[The Regina Monologues]]''. The amusing dialog consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and [[Lisa Simpson]]:

'''Lisa:''' Look! It's J.K. Rowling, author of ''Harry Potter'' books! You've turned a generation of kids onto reading.<br>
'''Rowling''': Thank you, young Muggle.<br>
'''Lisa''': Can you tell me what happens at the end of the series?<br>
'''Rowling''': (sigh) He grows up and marries you. Is that what you want to hear?<br>
'''Lisa''': (dreamily) Yes.

Producer [[Russell T. Davies]] asked Rowling to pen an episode of the upcoming season of [[Doctor Who]]; though Rowling was "amused by the suggestion, but simply [didn't] have the time" {{Ref|Davies}}. 

In a July 2005 interview with the [[MuggleNet]] and [[The-Leaky-Cauldron.org|Leaky Cauldron]] websites' managers, Rowling revealed that she is a great admirer of [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s work on the American TV show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''{{ref|Anelli}}.
<br style="clear:both">

==Lawsuits==
Rowling has been involved in several [[lawsuits]] over the Harry Potter series.

===Nancy Stouffer===
In the late [[1990s]] [[Nancy Stouffer]], an author of children's books published in the [[1980s]], began to charge publicly that Rowling's books were based on her books, including ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''. Stouffer sued Rowling and [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic, Inc.]]  in U.S. District Court, also naming [[Time Warner]] as a party. Rowling, Scholastic and Warner Bros. sued Stouffer in New York, asking the court to judge that there was no infringement of Stouffer's [[trademark]]s or [[copyright]]{{Ref|BBC-harry}}. Rowling and her co-litigants argued that much of the evidence that Stouffer presented was fraudulent, and asked for sanctions and attorneys' fees as punishment{{uncited}}. In September 2002 the court found in Rowling's favour, stating that Stouffer had lied to the court and falsified and forged documents to support her case. Stouffer was fined US$50,000 and ordered to pay part (but not all) of the plaintiffs' costs{{ref|Reuters-court}}. In [[January 2004]] it was reported that Stouffer's appeal against the judgement had been rejected. The appeals court agreed that Stouffer's claims were properly dismissed because "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works"{{ref|HPANA-nancy}}. Stouffer was also ordered to pay the costs of the appeal{{ref|HPANA-nancy}}. A report of the judgement (requires subscription) can be found at [http://www.entlawdigest.com/story.cfm?storyID=3094 Entertainment Law Digest]. The 2002 judgement can be found  [http://www.eyrie.org/~robotech/stouffer.htm here].

===''New York Daily News''=== 	 
On [[19 June]] [[2003]] Rowling and her publisher Scholastic announced that they would sue the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' for $100 million because the [[newspaper]] had printed information on her work ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' before the book's official release date. The novel was due for release on Saturday [[21 June]], but the newspaper published a plot summary and short quotes on the previous Wednesday. An accompanying image even revealed two pages from the book with legible text. However, the story was complicated further when it was revealed that the paper had purchased the book from a health store whose owner received the novels [[wholesale]] and decided to place them in the window. The man claimed he was unaware he was supposed to wait until that Saturday.{{ref|Rowling-v-NYDN}}

===''The Bashu Publishing House, Chengdu''=== 	 
In 2003, unauthorised [[China|Chinese]]-language "sequels" to the [[Harry Potter]] series, such as ''[[Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon]]'', appeared for sale in the [[People's Republic of China]]. These books, written by [[ghostwriter]]s, contain characters from the works of other authors, including [[Gandalf]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', and the title character from [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. Rowling's lawyers successfully took legal action against the publishers, who were forced to pay damages{{ref|August}}.

===Eksmo Publishers=== 	 
Also in 2003, courts in the [[Netherlands]] prevented the distribution of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation of ''Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass'', the first of [[Dmitry Yemets]]' popular [[Russian language|Russian]] series about a female apprentice wizard, [[Tanya Grotter]]. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate [[copyright]] law. Yemets and his original [[Moscow]]-based publishers, [[Eksmo]], argued unsuccessfully that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright{{ref|Rowling-grotter}}.
