'''John W. Cooper''' ([[1873]]-[[1966]]) was an [[African-American]] [[ventriloquist]] of the early [[20th century]]. He was the first black ventriloquist on the predominantly white [[vaudeville]] circuit, and later in his life taught ventriloquism to [[Shari Lewis]]. 

He began his career in 1886 with the Southern Jubilee Singers, touring the country for four years. He joined [[Richards and Pringles Georgia Minstrels]] for their 1900-01 season. Unlike the other performers in the group, however, Cooper was not a typical [[minstrel show]] performer. Instead of singing and dancing in the stereotypical manner of minstrel shows of the era, he performed as a ventriloquist, and neither he or his dummy, Sam Jackson, wore blackface as part of their act. 

His break into the vaudeville circuit came as a result of a white vaudeville union's strike in 1901. Cooper ignored the strike and became a fixture on the vaudeville circuit, leading to performances on many radio shows throughout the rest of his life including a weekly performance on "The Major Bowes Original Amateur Hour." 

===Sam Jackson===
Through his vaudeville days, parts of Cooper's act included Sam Jackson claiming he was a cousin of Charlie McCarthy, the famous dummy of [[Edgar Bergen]]. Background research performed as part of a PBS series discovered that both McCarthy and Jackson were made by [[Theodore Mack]], a prominent puppet maker from [[Chicago]]. Sam in fact predates McCarthy, though by what span of time is unclear.
