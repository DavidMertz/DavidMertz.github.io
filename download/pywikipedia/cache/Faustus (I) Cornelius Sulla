'''Faustus Cornelius Sulla the First''', eldest surviving child of the [[Roman dictator|Dictator of Rome]] [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix]], born in [[Arrentium]] in 78 BC. (Another source states he was born in Greece where his mother had fled between 86 and 81 BC.)  He was known simply as Faustus, the only Roman to be called that since [[Faustus Valerius]] in the time of [[Numa Pompilius]].

Faustus Cornelius Sulla was the head of the branch of the [[Patrician]] family [[Cornelius (gens)|Cornelius]] [[cognomen|cognimate]]d Sulla, a family consisting only of himself, and his cousin [[Publius Cornelius Sulla]], adherent to Faustus' nephew by marriage [[Gaius Julius Caesar]]. As a member of one of the most ancient patrician families, the Cornelii, and the son of the great Dictator, promising things were prophesied for the young Sulla, doubly so as, after his father's death, he was brought up by his guardian, his father's friend [[Lucullus]].

Faustus married [[Pompeia Magna]], daughter of the notable [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]]. They had three children. His career as an advocate was cut short, however, by the civil war between Pompey and Caesar.  He, as Lucullus' ward and Pompey's son-in-law, sided with the former and was killed in a minor skirmish with [[Caesar]]ian troops in 47 BC.
