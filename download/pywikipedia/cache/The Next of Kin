}}'''''The Next of Kin''''', also known as '''''Next of Kin''''', is a [[1942 in film|1942]] [[World War II]] [[propaganda]] film produced by [[Ealing Studios]]. 

The film was originally commissioned by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[War Office]] as a training film to promote the contemporary Government propaganda message that "Careless talk costs lives". After being taken on by Ealing Studios, the project was expanded and given a successful commercial release. 

====Plot summary====
{{spoiler}}
The British army is preparing an attack on a [[Nazi Germany|German-held]] [[France|French]] port. German intelligence use agents in England to discover the intended target by piecing together information from different sources, including conversations overheard in pubs, railway stations, shops and other public places. 
When the attack takes place, the element of surprise has been lost and the British suffer heavy casualties. 

====Additional information====
{{spoiler}} 
*Originally, the commando raid depicted was intended to be a complete failure. However, the War Office were uncomfortable about a film showing such a defeat. In the final film, the raid is shown as being successful, albeit with heavy losses. [[Winston Churchill]] reportedly wanted the film banned as a threat to morale, but was eventually persuaded of the importance of its message.

* [[Basil Radford]] and [[Naunton Wayne]] appear in cameos as two "careless talkers" on a train at the end of the film. The two made many appearances together in British films of the 1940s, following their successful pairing as "Charters" and "Caldicott" in [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]''.
