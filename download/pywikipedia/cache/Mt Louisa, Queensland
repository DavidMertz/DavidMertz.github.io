'''Mt Louisa''' is one of the original suburbs of [[Queensland]] and is located on the north and ocean side of the city.  It is placed around the foothills of Mt Louisa itself rising from 15m above sea level to the mountain's peak of 185 m ASL.  The older section of Mt Louisa faces the ocean and Magnetic Island, while new developments have seen large new housing estates being built on the western and northern aspects of the mount.
