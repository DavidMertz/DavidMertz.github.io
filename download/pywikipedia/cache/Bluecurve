[[Image:Red hat.png|thumb|230px|Bluecurve theme on Red Hat Linux.]]
'''Bluecurve''' is a [[desktop theme]] for [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] created by the [[Red Hat]] Artwork project. The main aim of Bluecurve was to create a unified look throughout the [[Linux]] environment. It has been used in [[Red Hat Linux]] since version 8.0, and [[Fedora Core]].

The Bluecurve windowing theme was succeeded in Fedora Core 4 by [[ClearLooks]], although the icons remain. The GTK+ (widget) theme was replaced by [[ClearLooks]] in Fedora Core 5. However, the old BlueCurve themes (windowing and widgets) are still installed by default and can be selected in the theme manager.

There has been controversy surrounding the theme, especially the alterations to KDE, which were sufficiently severe as to cause developer [[Bernhard Rosenkraenzer]] to quit [[Red Hat]] [http://slashdot.org/articles/02/09/25/2042208.shtml] &mdash; ''"mostly in mutual agreement &mdash; I don't want to work on crippling KDE, and they don't want an employee who admits RHL 8.0's KDE is crippleware."'' [http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-devel&m=103293985032408] Others simply criticize it for giving the same look to both desktops, even though they are obviously different in many ways. Note that this approach was subsequently emulated by [[Mandrake Linux]] with their "Galaxy" theme, which was also available for GNOME and KDE.

Enterprising [[Graphical_user_interface|GUI]] artists have created themes that emulate the Bluecurve theme on other operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Users can also replace their default Windows icons with icons that emulate Bluecurve, using the [[IconPackager]] application. One such set can be downloaded at [[WinCustomize]].
