'''Eccky''' is an online [[life simulation game]], in which two people come together to create and raise a [[Virtual#Computing|virtual]] [[baby]]. Created by Dutch developer,  [http://www.mediarepublic.com Media Republic], in association with [[MSN]] the Netherlands, Eccky brings together characteristics of other life simulation and [[virtual pet]] games (such as [[Tamagotchi]], [[NeoPets]], [[GoPets]], and [[the Sims]]) but is unique in two important aspects: first, the virtual baby, or Eccky, is born on the basis of information derived from both Eccky user parents, and second, Eccky has a unique chat capability never before seen in existing life simulation and virtual pet games.  That is, thanks to an [[AIML]] [[chatbot]] and via [[MSN Messenger]], Eccky parents can actually chat with their Eccky.

== Concept ==
[[Image:Eccky-egg.jpg|thumb|left|''Eccky: the world's first virtual baby'']]
The Eccky concept originated, in large part, from the recognition of the enormous popularity and widespread use of the [[MSN Messenger]] [[chat]] program in the [[Netherlands]].  In the Netherlands alone, [[MSN Messenger]] boasts more than 5 million active users, and, in the case of younger [[demographic]] groups, MSN Messenger is often an even more common means of communication than the [[mobile phone]]. Further, the Eccky concept is innovative in its cross-media nature, going beyond a single [[platform]] to utilize MSN Messenger, the [[internet]], [[WAP]] sites, a [[Java application]] when played on the [[mobile telephone]], [[WAP|WAP-Push]], and [[text messaging]], all in a single game, to create as varied (and, ideally fun and satisfying) a [[gameplay]] experience as possible for user parents.

== Origin of Eccky name ==
The name “Eccky” is inspired by a word of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] derivation, ''[[ecchi]]'', whose meaning can be roughly translated to “naughty”: a term that, in any culture and society, can be associated with [[children]]. Also and as a happy coincidence, the word “eccky” resembles the word “[[egg]]”, from which new Ecckies are born in the game.

== Birth and Description ==
=== Registration, Invitation, DNA tests and birth ===
The premise of Eccky is simple: two people come together to create a [[virtual]] [[baby]], and raise him/her with the goal of making the child as happy and satisfied as possible.  A user must consists of a [[questionnaire]] that user parents must fill in with information regarding their personal characteristics, child-rearing attitudes, favorites, etc. Once registration and the "[[DNA]]" test have been completed, a user may invite another person to make an Eccky.  Upon accepting the invitation, the second user also registers on the Eccky website, and completes his/her own "[[DNA]]" test. Both parents then choose both a [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] [[name]] for their future Eccky. Thereafter Eccky is born, with characteristics determined by the combination of both user parents' DNA profiles.  Eccky's sex is randomly determined, as is Eccky’s name (which is chosen randomly between the four possible names chosen by the user parents).

From its live introduction to the public until August 2006, Eccky required payment of an initial fee of 1.50 [[euro]], which could be paid by either user parent. However Eccky has been free to play since September 2006.

=== Life span ===
Over a six-day period from Eccky’s [[birth]], Eccky grows and ages three years for every one day of [[gameplay]]. Thus, in six days, Eccky develops from a cooing [[baby]] into an eighteen-year-old [[young adult]] with its own [[character]]. Every Eccky is unique at birth, and the way in which the user parents raise their Eccky further individualizes Eccky’s demeanor and [[characteristics]]. On the sixth day, or upon turning 18, Eccky leaves the house to venture off into the wide world, and the game ends.

== Gameplay and Chat ==
=== Chat via MSN Messenger ===
Eccky is a [[multifaceted]] game (played principally via the Eccky [[website]] and MSN Messenger, though also via mobile phone) and boasts a revolutionary new form of chat [[interactivity]].  Upon Eccky’s birth, Eccky is automatically added as a contact to the MSN contact lists of both [[parents]].  This allows user parents to talk to their virtual child. Running on an [[AIML]] [[chat engine]], Eccky is able to speak from the moment following birth, both in response to user parents addressing Eccky and by initiating [[conversation]] him/herself. Eccky will initiate conversation either randomly or to express any particularly pressing need he/she may have (i.e. being extremely hungry, having to go to the bathroom, being very sick, feeling neglected, etc.) As with any real child, Eccky’s [[vocabulary]] is initially limited to newborn [[babble]]. Then, as with a real child, Eccky’s command of vocabulary grows with each day of gameplay, to a final capability of being able to respond with over 60,000 unique answers on more than 4,000 diverse subjects.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher=Media Republic |date=[[2005-10-27]] | title=Media Republic introduces Eccky BETA in collaboration with MSN | url=http://www.eccky.com/weblog/eccky_pressrelease_en.doc}}</ref>

=== Mobile Eccky ===
Eccky and user parents can also exchange text messages via mobile phone.  Exchange of text messages requires that the user parent have a mobile phone, and that the user parent purchase a mobile phone for Eccky within the game environment.  This feature involves some extra costs to the user parent, specifically the cost of sending text messages, and can be turned on and off at the user parent’s discretion.

=== Virtual World Interaction ===
==== Virtual World Locations ====
As a life simulation game, Eccky realistically simulates a real-life environment by way of the Eccky [[virtual world]] on the Eccky website, a world in which numerous elements of real, daily life are integrated, visually, functionally, and textually.  As such, users find, within the Eccky virtual world, a number of realistic locations, within which to care for and interact with Eccky.  These locations can be subdivided into locations within Eccky’s house, and outside of Eccky’s house.  Within the house, the user finds:
*a kitchen, in which to feed Eccky
*a bedroom, where Eccky goes to sleep each night
*a wardrobe room, where clothing is stored and where Eccky can change clothes
*a living room, containing various quizzes to play with Eccky
*a bathroom, in which to take care of Eccky’s hygiene and toileting needs

Outside of the house, there are:
*a supermarket, where users can purchase food and drinks for Eccky
*a school, where users can play various quizzes with Eccky, both educational and entertainment-related
*a playground, which is the location of the largest number of in-game games to be played with Eccky (including go-karting, penalty shooting, water balloon fighting, miniature golf, and tennis)
*a beach
*a clothing shop, where Eccky’s clothing and accessories are purchased
*a mobile phone shop, where users can purchase a mobile phone for their Eccky
*a hangout, where user parents can engage in available in-game games, as well as purchase snacks and drinks for Eccky

==== Games ====
Most games are intended to be played with user parents playing against their Eccky and vice versa.  Others are played in cooperation with Eccky. Of note are the racing games, some of which allow users to create their own tracks and race on them with Eccky.  Though most games are free to play, some games require additional credits to play.

==== Proper Care of Eccky ====
Eccky’s physical and emotional states are subject to continual change, determined by 180 dynamic [[variable]]s, and are influenced by the interaction with and treatment by user parents, both via the virtual world and via the chat. The levels of these physical and emotional states are continually assessed and are made visible to user parents via meters that gauge happiness, hunger, toilet needs, popularity, who Eccky’s favorite parent is, etc.  For example, if Eccky is not sufficiently fed, users will see this in Eccky’s hunger meter. In worst case scenarios, an Eccky can be neglected, physical and emotionally, to the point of needing to be sent to the hospital.  During this time, gameplay continues and user parents may chat with Eccky, but may not interact with Eccky in the virtual world.  Further, Eccky’s physical and emotional states are reflected in the chat element, as Eccky will either comment, unsolicited, on how he/she is doing physically and emotionally, or respond to a user parent in such a way as to make his/her physical and emotional state known.

==== Other Accommodations ====
It is also possible to send Eccky away for a period, either to live in other accommodations such as in a hotel, on vacation, or to stay with a babysitter.  A babysitter may be anyone with an MSN Messenger account.  Sending Eccky to a hotel or on vacation does involve additional costs (sending Eccky to a babysitter does not), and as with Eccky staying in the hospital, user parents may continue to speak with Eccky via chat but cannot interact with Eccky in the virtual world setting during this time.  A user parent can retrieve their Eccky at any time during a stay away from home.

==== Replay Value ====
Theoretically, Eccky has unlimited [[replay value]].  Just like a real child, every Eccky (even by the same two user parents) is unique, and will yield a different user experience. Further, the Eccky gameplay experience can be individualized for players by making Ecckies with other users and not always with the same fellow user parent. And beyond the actual “DNA” make-up of an Eccky, the way in which a user parent raises an Eccky is also a highly individualized process.  A user will not raise or interact with even several of his/her own Ecckies in exactly the same way, which makes for a different Eccky experience every time.

== Release of Dutch Eccky in the Netherlands ==
=== Beta Launch ===
Developed in the Netherlands by Media Republic, in collaboration with MSN the Netherlands, Eccky was first released in its Dutch [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] version in August 2005.

=== Official Launch and Dutch Doritos Campaign ===
In conjunction with Eccky’s official Dutch release in March 2006, the ‘[http://www.eccky.nl/eccky_nl_doritos/home Flirt & Score with Doritos]’ campaign, a collaborative campaign between Eccky and Doritos, offered the target group of Eccky users consisting of 15- to 24-year olds in the Netherlands the possibility of [[flirting]] with each other via a community website and potentially making “love matches” with each other. The end goal for users then was to make Ecckies out of those love matches, but also to achieve the enviable status of “biggest flirt”.

=== SpinAwards ===
Barely a month following its official release in the Netherlands, Eccky was recognized with two awards by the [http://www.spinawards.nl SpinAwards] organization, an independent organization based in the Netherlands that recognizes achievements in development of interactive communication.  Eccky was awarded top honors in the “Innovation prize” category, as well as a silver prize in the category of “Best Free Interactive Concept”.
