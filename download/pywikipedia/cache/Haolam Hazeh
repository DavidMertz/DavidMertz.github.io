'''''Haolam Hazeh''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: העולם הזה, meaning This World) was a weekly news magazine published in [[Israel]] until 1993.

''Haolam Hazeh'' was founded in 1937 under the name ''Tesha Baerev'' (Hebrew: תשע בערב, literally Nine O’Clock in the Evening) but was renamed to ''Haolam Hazeh'' in 1946. In 1950, it was bought by [[Uri Avnery]], [[Shalom Cohen]], and two others who soon withdrew.

Under Avnery's leadership, the magazine became famous for its highly unorthodox and irreverent style.  Its news focussed on investigative reports, often presented in sensationalist fashion, which provoked anger from the Israeli establishment and disdain from Israel's mainstream press.  Government ministers regularly called for it to be shut down, especially when it had exposed (or claimed to expose) some government scandal.  For a few years, the government even secretly financed a rival magazine ''Rimon'' in a failed attempt to counter ''Haolam Hazeh's'' popularity.  Sometimes mainstream publications leaked to ''Haolam Hazeh'' stories that they felt unable to publish themselves.

Starting in 1959, the magazine had a "two cover" design, with the front cover presenting serious journalism and the back cover presenting sensational articles of a gossipy or sexual nature, sometimes displaying naked women.

Stories in which ''Haolam Hazeh's'' reporting played an important part included the massacre at [[Qibya massacre|Qibya]] (after which Avnery and Cohen were allegedly beaten up by members of the IDF unit that had conducted the raid), <ref>Oren Meyers, [http://burdacenter.bgu.ac.il/publications/finalReports2001-2002/Meyers.pdf Israeli Journalists as an Interpretive Community: A Case Study of 1950s Mainstream Journalistic Attitudes towards Haolam Hazeh], University of Haifa</ref> the [[Rudolf Kasztner|Kasztner]] libel trial, the [[Kafr Qasim massacre]], and [[Ben Dunkelman]]´s story about the aborted attempt to expel the inhabitants of [[Nazareth]] (in Haolam Hazeh July 1980)
