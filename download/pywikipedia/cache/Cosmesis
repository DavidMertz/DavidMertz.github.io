'''Cosmesis''' is the preservation, restoration, or bestowing of bodily beauty.<ref>''[[Dorland's Medical Dictionary]]''. 25th ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co.; 1995</ref> In the medical context, it usually refers to the surgical correction of a disfiguring defect, or the cosmetic improvements made by a surgeon following incisions. Its usage is generally limited to the additional, usually minor, steps that the surgeon (who generally is operating for non-cosmetic indications) takes to improve the aesthetic appearance of the scars associated with the operation. Typical actions include removal of damaged tissue, mitigation of tension on the wound and/or using fine (thin) sutures to close the outer layer of skin.

''Cosmetic surgery'' is the portion of [[plastic surgery]] that concerns itself with the elective improvement of cosmesis.
