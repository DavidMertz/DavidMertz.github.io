Coined by [[Wendell Berry]] in his essay<ref>Berry, Wendell, ''The Gift of Good Land: Further Essays Cultural and Agricultural'', 1981, ISBN 0-86547-052-9</ref> of the same title, '''Solving for pattern''' is the process of finding solutions that solve multiple problems, while minimizing the creation of new problems. The essay was originally published in the [[Rodale Press]] periodical The New Farm.

Though Mr. Berry's use of the phrase was in direct reference to [[agriculture]], it has since come to enjoy broader use throughout the design community.
