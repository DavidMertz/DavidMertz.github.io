'''Andhra Christian Theological College (ACTC)'''<ref>Reformed Online[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=11197&lg=eng] Addresses. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref> is an ecumenical enterprise of the mainline Churches in [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[India]]. 

It was established in the year 1964 and is affiliated to the '''Senate of [[Serampore College]] ( which is an unaccredited University)'''<ref>Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Education [http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/n/75/7Y/757Y0H01.htm] Other Universities.

ACTC is situated on the banks of Hussainsagar excess water canal (north) in Gandhinagar, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

==Motto==
Verse XII of Chapter IV of [[Ephesians]] found in the '''[[Holy Bible]]''' - '''[[King James Version]]''' - "For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ"
<ref>Scripturetext.com[http://scripturetext.com/ephesians/4-12.htm] Ephesians 4:12. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref>: is the force behind this ecumenical enterprise. 

In the '''[[Latin Vulgate]]''', it is said thus<ref>The Latin Vulgate [http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=1&b=10&c=4] The Epistle of St.Paul to the Ephesians: Chapter 4. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref>, ''"ad consummationem sanctorum in opus ministerii in aedificationem corporis christi"''.

==Background==
Missionaries in Andhra Pradesh were involved in spreading<ref> Martin Senftleben [http://www.drmartinus.de/bio/de/thesis1.pdf] Influences of Hinduism on Christianity in Andhra Pradesh. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref> the [[Word of God]]. With a sizeable converts at hand the need for ministering them was possible only with [[Priests]]. With this, they started to open seminaries.

The missionaries were careful not to encroach into others territories while ministering - they created comities for this purpose. Seminaries were established in Dornakal (Andhra Union Theological College [http://www.library.uu.nl/digiarchief/dip/diss/01872495/chapter9.pdf]) to cater to the Church of South India, Ramapatnam (Baptist Theological Seminary) for the American Baptists, Luthergiri<ref>Winnipeg Free Press[http://www.abrahamlincolnarchive.com/Landing.aspx?search=luthergiri&img=Rvj45z7SpqiKID/6NLMW2ql7x7NgdtJRVzgeTTqBil9AAmBs+7/uoA==] United Lutheran Church Advances - The Board sends new missionaries to each of six foreign mission fields. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref>. (Lutheran Theological College) for the Lutherans, in [[Kakinada]] ([[Baptist Theological Seminary]]) for the Canadian Baptists, and [[Shamshabad]] (Mennonite Brethren Bible College) for the [[Mennonite Brethren]].

There was exchange of Professors between the Seminaries. However, for higher education ([[Bachelor of Divinity]]), they had to send their students to [[West Bengal]] where [[Serampore College]] is located.

==The Kretzmann's Commission==
The mainline Churches in [[Andhra Pradesh]] felt the need for having a unified seminary where higher theological education could be taught. Together, they appointed a Commission under the Chairmanship of M.L.Kretzmann<ref>Grace Lutheran Church[http://www.gracelutheranchurch.ca/MMS_IELC.html] India Evangelical Lutehran Church. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref> <ref>crossings.org[http://www.crossings.org/thursday/Thur010804.htm] The LCMS Mission Affirmations of 1965 - Then and Now. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref> to explore the possibilities of forming such a unified Seminary. After a lot of talks, the Commission came out with a report that was tabled before the mainline Churches. All the mainline Churches except the Mennonite Brethren<ref>M.B.Herald[http://old.mbconf.ca/mb/mbh3509.htm] MBs have history of involvement in India. Retrieved April 23, 2006.</ref> agreed for the setting up of a unified Seminary. They zeroed-in onto Luthergiri. With this, all higher-educated Theologians taught in the newly set-up College.

==Accreditation==
The degrees are accredited by what  is called the Senate of Serampore College which is also addressed by many Indian Christians as Serampore University. However, this is only a pseudonym and the Senate of Serampore College is not an accredited University. It has no status in front of the University Grants Commission. It is not accredited by any accrediting body in India. Consequently, the degrees issued by this theological department do not carry the name of any University.

As such, its degrees may not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and use of degree titles may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions. According to the India Department of Education, without accreditation or an act of Parliament "It is emphasized that these fake institutions have no legal entity to call themselves as University/Vishwvidyalaya and to award ‘degrees’ which are not treated as valid for academic/employment purposes." [http://www.education.nic.in/htmlweb/he-centraluniversities-list.htm]. It is also not listed by the UNESCO list of accredited institutions of higher learning [http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list.html]

==Location==
In the year 1964, the College was set up in Luthergiri in the river town of [[Rajahmundry]] in [[East Godavari]] District with the coming together of the following theological colleges<ref>[[Victor Premasagar]] [http://www.mergingcurrents.com/book.php?BookSKU=2928] Interpretive Diary of a Bishop, Chennai, 2001, p.88</ref>, ''viz.,''
* Andhra Union Theological College, Dornakal,
* [[Baptist Theological Seminary]], [[Kakinada]],
* Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramapatnam, and 
* Lutheran Theological College, [[Rajahmundry]].

Later, due to pollution from nearby Paper Mills, they felt the need to relocate. After many deliberations, they chose [[Secunderabad]].  By 1973 the college in its entirety was moved from [[Rajahmundry]] to [[Secunderabad]].  By virtue of postal re-classification in the 1990s, its location fell under [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]].
