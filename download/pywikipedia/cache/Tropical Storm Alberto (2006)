{{dablink|This article is about the 2006 tropical storm.  For other storms of the same name, see [[Hurricane Alberto]].}}

'''Tropical Storm Alberto''' was the first [[tropical storm]] of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Forming on [[June 10]] in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] as a tropical depression, the storm moved northward and then northeastward, reaching a peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h), before making landfall in the Big Bend area of [[Florida]] on [[June 13]]. Alberto then moved through eastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] as a tropical depression before becoming [[extratropical]] on [[June 14]]. Alberto's strength was difficult to forecast as officials at the [[National Hurricane Center]] and local weather stations predicted that the storm would not greatly intensify.  However, when Alberto's winds rapidly reached 70 mph, storm forecasters thought that the storm might reach minimal hurricane strength, but that did not occur due to increasing upper-level [[wind shear]] interacting with the system.

Alberto produced heavy rain across [[Florida]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] causing moderate flooding in some areas. While a monetary damage estimate is unavailable as of [[June 15]], [[2006]], Alberto caused two indirect deaths. The first indirect death occurred when a small plane crashed during the storm, killing its occupant. The second death was from drowning. A report of nine people missing was actually a hoax.<ref name="boathoax">{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13582906/ | title=Officials: Call Reporting Missing Boaters Was Hoax | accessdate=2006-07-10 | date=[[2006-06-27]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] }}</ref>

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Alberto_2006_track.png}}
During the first several days of June, a low pressure area along a sharp surface trough moved slowly through the western [[Caribbean Sea]] and gradually became more organized as tropical waves passed through the system.  The last of the tropical waves which interacted with the disturbance left the coast of Africa on [[May 30]].  By [[June 8]], the low became better organized as an upper level ridge built over the disturbance.  By [[June 10]], the cyclone had developed enough organization to be designated the first [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical depression]] of the season.<ref name="NHC discussion 1">{{cite web | first=Jack | last=Beven | title=Tropical Depression One Special Discussion #1, 8:00 a.m. CDT | date =[[June 10]], [[2006]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2006-06-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al012006/dis/al012006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression was located in a relatively hostile environment, with enormous dry air in the western [[Gulf of Mexico]] and moderate [[wind shear]], which slowed further development.  The depression slowly became better organized, and when sustained winds were found to be of tropical storm strength by the morning of [[June 11]], the cyclone was designated Tropical Storm Alberto.<ref name="NHC advisory 6">{{cite web | first=Richard | last=Pasch | title=Tropical Storm Alberto Advisory #6, 10:00 a.m. CDT | date =[[June 11]], [[2006]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2006-06-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al012006/pub/al012006.public.006.shtml?}}</ref>

Southwesterly vertical wind shear caused most of the convection to be displaced to the eastern half of the storm, with little activity on the western half of the circulation, causing the center to be broad and ill-defined. On the morning of June 12, the circulation center jumped downshear <!-- downshear? --> farther northeast towards the deep convection, while deep, warm waters in the [[Loop Current]].<ref name="NHC discussion 10">{{cite web| last = Pasch | first = Richard|year=[[June 12]], [[2006]]|title=Tropical Storm Alberto Forecast Discussion #10, 11 a.m. EDT |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2006-06-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al012006/dis/al012006.discus.010.shtml?}}</ref> allowed Alberto to strengthen, becoming a strong tropical storm with 70&nbsp;[[mph]] (115&nbsp;[[km/h]]) winds.  Vertical wind shear persisted, and the system began to weaken as it moved away from the Loop Current.<ref name="NHC discussion 11">{{cite web| last = Pasch | first = Richard|year=[[June 12]], [[2006]]|title=Tropical Storm Alberto Forecast Discussion #11, 5 p.m. EDT |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2006-06-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al012006/dis/al012006.discus.011.shtml?}}</ref>

The system lost tropical characteristics that morning and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical low-pressure system]] as it began to move offshore into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].  The remnant low began to strengthen as a mid-latitude cyclone to the east of an upper level trough.  Its wind speeds reached storm strength, with gusts to hurricane force, as it deepened rapidly offshore [[New England]] to the south of the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritime]] provinces, reaching a minimum central pressure of 970 [[mbar]] as of the early afternoon on [[June 15]].<ref name="CHC IS">{{cite web | author = Canadian Hurricane Centre | title=Post-Tropical Storm Alberto Information Statement, 3:00 p.m. ADT | date =[[June 15]], [[2006]]|publisher=[[Canadian Hurricane Centre]]|accessdate=2006-06-15|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20060615180233.Alberto.txt.en}}</ref> The cyclone weakened thereafter, and crossed the northern Atlantic, moving into Great Britain early on [[June 19]] and into the North Sea by afternoon.

The heavy rainfall in Cuba damaged 37 homes and destroyed 3 in the city of [[Havana]].<ref name="cubeff"/>

Overall damage on land was fairly minor in [[Florida]]. While there were reports of flooding in coastal communities, it was relatively small-scale. Scattered [[power outage]]s were also reported. The rainfall was beneficial to the area as it has been in [[drought]] conditions and was under a high to extreme [[wildfire]] risk at the time, which the heavy rain helped alleviate.<ref>{{cite news |first = Mitch |last = Stacy |url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060613/ap_on_re_us/tropical_weather_75;_ylt=AgAgFeQdaapnlr.s0a2h6MyCbpwv;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl |title = Little damage reported as Alberto hits Fla. |publisher = [[Associated Press]] |date = [[June 13]], [[2006]] |accessdate = 2006-06-13}}</ref>[[Image:alberto-flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Storm surge flooding from Tropical Storm Alberto at [[Horseshoe Beach, Florida]].]]

There was a small plane crash on [[June 12]], [[2006]], in the [[Tampa, Florida]] neighborhood of [[Davis Islands (Florida)|Davis Islands]], directly south of downtown Tampa. The pilot was said to have died when his small plane crashed into a home near [[Peter O. Knight Airport]], which is located on the southern tip of the island.
