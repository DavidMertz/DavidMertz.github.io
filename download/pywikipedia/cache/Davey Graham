'''Davey Graham''' (originally ''Davy Graham'', b. [[22 November]] [[1940]]) is a virtuoso guitarist who is credited with sparking the folk-rock revolution in the UK in the 1960s.  He inspired many of the famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar, such as [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]], [[Martin Carthy]], [[Paul Simon]] and even [[Jimmy Page]], and is best-known for his acoustic instrumental, ''Anji''.

==Biography==
Davy Graham was born to a [[Guyana|Guyanan]] mother and  [[Scotland|Scottish]] father and he took up the guitar at the age of 12. As a teenager, he was strongly influenced by a guitar player called [[Steve Benbow]], who had travelled widely with the army and played a guitar style influenced by Moroccan music. At the age of 19, Graham wrote what is probably his most famous piece, at least for aspiring guitarists: the acoustic solo tune '''''Anji''''' (see below).

One way he came to the attention of guitarists was through a 1959 feature item in the BBC TV news program ''Monitor''.  The segment was produced by [[Ken Russell]].

He introduced the [[DADGAD]] guitar tuning to British guitarists, though it is not clear if it originated with him.  Its main attraction was that it allowed the guitarist more freedom to improvise in the treble while maintaining a solid underlying harmony and rhythm in the bass.  While 'non-standard', or 'non-classical' tunings were widely practiced by guitarists before this (Open E and Open G tunings were in common use by [[Blues]] and [[Slide guitar]] players) his use of DADGAD introduced a second standard tuning to guitarists.

During the 1960s he released a string of eclectic albums with music from all around the world in all kinds of genres.

He was always unpredictable, which did little to endear him to concert organisers and the more commercial elements of the music world. On one occasion, in the late 1960s, he was booked for a tour of Australia but, when his plane stopped for an hour in Bombay, he changed his plans and spent the next six months wandering through India.

His continuous touring of the world, picking up and then recording different styles of music for the guitar, has resulted in many musicians crediting him with founding [[World Music]].


He was the subject of a 2005 BBC Radio documentary '''''Whatever happened to Davy Graham ?''''' [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio2_aod.shtml?radio2/r2_davygraham] and in 2006 featured in the BBC Four documentary '''''Folk Britannia''''' [http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/features/folk-britannia.shtml].

Now he is playing concerts again, and working with other guitarists, including [[Bert Jansch]], [[Mark Pavey]], [[Duck Baker]] and [[Martin Carthy]]. He is planning to record a new album including some new material, as well as reworking of his earlier material.

==Anji==
Davey Graham's  acoustic guitar solo ''Anji'' spread like wildfire through a generation of aspiring guitarists.  The title is sometimes written as  ''Angi'', or ''Angie'', but the spelling ''Anji'' is most popular, as this is the way it appeared on [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s album ''[[Sounds of Silence]]''. The tune was named after Graham's current girlfriend at this time.

The origin of the tune remains controversial. At the time it was written, various young acoustic guitarists, including Graham, used to meet at "The Gyre and Gimble" coffee shop in John Adams Street, near [[Charing Cross]], [[London]]. It was customary for them to exchange riffs and learn new ideas from one another and it was always claimed by one of them, named Sydney Katzenell, that he was the original author of Anji, and that Graham simply developed and polished it. Certainly, the tune is an amalgamation of several musical ideas: the main riff has similarities with the song "Hit the Road, Jack" (written by [[Percy Mayfield]]);  other parts draw on "Big Noise from Winnetka" (written by [[Bob Haggart]]) and a later section is based on "The Work Song" (by [[Nat Adderley]]).

The tune was recorded by Bert Jansch (on his 1964 debut album), Paul Simon (on the ''Sounds of Silence'' album) and [[Chicken Shack]] (on their [[100 Ton Chicken]] album), amongst others.
