'''Blind Melon''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band from the [[1990s]].

==Name==
Reportedly, the name "Blind Melon" describes some [[hippie]]s from [[Mississippi]], as used (or coined) by Brad Smith's father. Also, "Blind Melon Chitlin" was the name of a fictional bluesman appearing in a routine on the self-titled [[Cheech and Chong]] LP. These may be derivative of the name of an actual bluesman, [[Blind Lemon Jefferson|Blind ''Lemon'' Jefferson]].

==History==
Blind Melon signed to [[Capitol Records]] in [[1991]] (see [[1991 in music]]) and recorded an unreleased demo.  Frontman Shannon Hoon and [[Axl Rose]] (who was a friend of Hoon's sister) re-met, and Hoon sang back-up on several [[Guns N' Roses]] tracks, including "Don't Cry".{{ref|prato}}  The band's [[Blind Melon (album)|self-titled debut album]], [[record producer|produced]] by [[Rick Parashar]] ([[Pearl Jam]]), sold poorly until the single and [[music video]] for "[[No Rain]]" hit the airwaves and became a smash success, along with the popular [[video]] which featured the equally popular "Bee Girl" (played by [[Heather DeLoach]]).  Subsequently, ''Blind Melon'' went [[RIAA certification|platinum]] four times.  After opening for [[Neil Young]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Soundgarden]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], Blind Melon's own tour was cut short due to Hoon's escalating [[drug abuse]].

Hoon and the rest of the band began recording their sophomore album in [[New Orleans]] with producer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]].  Hoon would later admit that he had no memory of the recording session.  While Hoon checked into [[rehab]], the album, ''[[Soup (album)|Soup]]'', was released in [[1995]] (see [[1995 in music]]), but sold poorly. In 1995, Blind Melon also contributed the song "Out on the Tiles" to the ''[[Encomium (album)|Encomium]]'' tribute album to [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as a promotional CD with a cover of the [[School House Rock]] song "Three is a Magic Number".

Against the advice of Hoon's drug counselor, Blind Melon went on tour.  Hoon was found dead of a [[cocaine]] [[overdose]] on [[October 21]], 1995 in New Orleans.  With some unreleased vocals in the vaults, the remaining members released ''[[Nico (album)|Nico]]'' in [[1996]] (see [[1996 in music]]), with the profits going to a program that helps musicians with [[drug addiction|drug]] and [[alcohol addiction]].  After briefly attempting to continue, Blind Melon  officially disbanded on March 4, 1999, and the various members went on to other projects.

In [[2002]], Capitol Records released a ''Classic Masters'' CD showcasing twelve Blind Melon songs. Thanks to stronger than expected sales, the band released ''The Best of Blind Melon'' in [[2005]], a CD+DVD package that will feature Blind Melon performing live from a September 1995 concert in [[Chicago]] and a cd in april 2006 recorded live at the Palace in Hollywood on Oct 1995.

In early [[2006]], a [[tribute album]] to Blind Melon is also set for release by Yakmusic in [[New Zealand]] and will feature bands from all over the world. The album's profits will be used for charitable purposes and will be available online from numerous websites.
