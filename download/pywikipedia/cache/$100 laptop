The '''$100 laptop''' is an education project for creating an inexpensive [[laptop|laptop computer]] intended to provide every child in the world access to knowledge and modern forms of education.

The computers will be rugged, [[Linux]]-based, and so energy efficient that hand-cranking alone will generate sufficient power for operation. [[mobile ad-hoc network|Ad-hoc]] [[Wireless mesh network|wireless mesh networking]] may be used to allow many machines Internet access from one connection. The pricing goal is currently expected to start at around [[USD|$]]135 not hitting the [[USD|$]]100 mark until 2008. The laptops will be sold to governments and issued to children by schools on a basis of one laptop per child.

The laptop is being developed by the [[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) organization. OLPC is a [[Delaware]] based, [[non-profit organization]] created by faculty members of the [[MIT Media Lab]] to design, manufacture, and distribute the laptops. OLPC was announced by Media Lab chairman and co-founder [[Nicholas Negroponte]] at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].

==History==

[[Image:Kaye_negroponte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Lou Jepsen]], [[Alan Kay]] and Nicholas Negroponte unveil the $100 laptop]]

OLPC is based on “[[Constructionist learning|constructionist]]” theories of learning pioneered by [[Seymour Papert]] and later [[Alan Kay]], [[Mitchel Resnick]], and the principles expressed in [[Nicholas Negroponte]]’s book ''[[Being Digital]]'' (ISBN 0679439196). The founding corporate members are [[Google]], [[News Corp]], [[AMD]], [[Red Hat]], [[BrightStar|Brightstar]] and [[Nortel]], each of whom donated two million dollars to the project. All three individuals and five companies are active participants in OLPC. In many respects it is the descendant of the 1997 [[eMate]] (based on the [[Apple Newton]]), also aimed at the education market.

Negroponte showed two prototypes of the laptop on [[November 16]], [[2005]] at the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society ([[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]]) in [[Tunis]]: a non working physical model and a tethered version using an external board and separate keyboard. However, the device shown was a rough prototype using a standard development board, so there is still work on the development of the device to reach the intended cost. Negroponte estimated that the screen alone required three more months of development. The laptops are scheduled to be available by the end of 2006 or early 2007.

At the 2006 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], the [[United Nations Development Program]] announced it would back the laptop. UNDP released a statement saying they would work with OLPC to deliver “technology and resources to targeted schools in the least developed countries”. <ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HUNDRED_DOLLAR_LAPTOP “U.N. Lends Backing to the $100 Laptop”]  ''Associated Press'', accessed [[January 27]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Manufacturer===

The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) board of directors announced on [[December 13]], [[2005]] that 
[[Quanta Computers]] has been chosen as the [[Original Design Manufacturer|original design manufacturer]] (ODM) for the $100 laptop project. It is not yet finalized, but the decision was made after the board reviewed bids from several possible manufacturing companies. The company emphasizes that there is a lot of work that remains to be done: “We still need to put a large amount of research and development into this, and will then hopefully be ready to make a finished product in the second half of next year [2006]”, according to Quanta. Over the next six months, a team at Quanta Research Institute is going to be focusing on the $100 laptop. <ref>[http://news.ft.com/cms/s/b99fc856-6cbc-11da-90c2-0000779e2340.html “Quanta cool on contract for $100 laptops”] ''Financial Times'', accessed [[December 17]], [[2005]].</ref>

==Participating countries==
[[Brazil]]<ref>[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/03/10/1447582.htm “Govt studying independent US$100 laptop project”] ''TMCnet'', accessed [[March 10]], [[2006]].</ref>, [[Thailand]], [[Egypt]], [[United States]] (specifically the state of [[Massachusetts]]), [[Cambodia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Tunisia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]] have already “committed” to the project in various ways, according to Negroponte’s press releases. However, the commitment is not binding. The laptops will be sold to governments, to be distributed through the ministries of education willing to adopt the policy of “one laptop per child”. In the U.S., [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]] has submitted a bill to the legislature to deliver $100 laptops to all children in the state.

While the OLPC originally planned to make the laptop available only through governments, Negroponte has indicated that they may partner with well known brand-name manufacturers to create a commercial version which would sell for about $225, that would subsidize units in the [[developing world]].

==Technology==
[[Image:nn romney.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mitt Romney|Governor Romney]] with [[Nicholas Negroponte]] showing the first prototype.]]
The $100 Laptop will be a [[Linux]]-based, full-color, full-screen laptop. It will initially have a flat [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen, but in later generations may use [[electronic paper]] (for example [http://e-ink.com E-ink] developed at the [[MIT]] [[Media Lab]] by [[Joseph Jacobson]]). The laptop will be rugged, use innovative power (including a hand crank), be [[Wi-Fi]]- and [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]-enabled and a touch screen (including a separate writing pad). It will include a 900&nbsp;MHz processor and 512&nbsp;MiB of [[RAM]].

===Design requirements===
[[Mary Lou Jepsen]] stated the hardware design goals of this device as:
* minimal power consumption, with a design target of 2&nbsp;[[Watt|W]]–3&nbsp;W total power consumption
* minimal production cost, with a target of $100 per laptop for production runs of one million units;
* a ‘cool’ look, implying an innovative styling in its physical appearance
* [[ebook|eBook]] functionality with extremely low power consumption
* the software provided with the laptop be [[open source]] and [[free software]]

The software design requirements and the educational objectives have not been described publicly.

===Hardware===
The [[computer hardware|hardware]] specifications, [[as of 2005|as of December 2005]], with information from:
* the [http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/Hardware_specification OLPC Wiki, Hardware Specification]
* the [http://laptop.org/faq.html OLPC FAQ]
* a [http://www.andycarvin.com/archives/2005/11/the_100_laptop.html video interview] with [[Mary Lou Jepsen]] on [[November 17]] [[2005]] at the World Summit on the Information Society ([[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]]) in [[Tunis]]
* a [http://www.andycarvin.com/podcasts/negropontelaptop.mp3 recording] of a talk given by Nicholas Negroponte at the Technology Review's Fifth Annual Emerging Technologies Conference in September 2005.

====Features==== 
* A ‘special’ 366 [[Megahertz|MHz]] CPU by AMD ([[Advanced Micro Devices]]) Inc with 0.25&nbsp;W power consumption.
* [[SVGA]] 7″ diagonal transmissive and reflective [[liquid crystal display]] used in one of two modes: 
** Transmissive Color/DVD mode with 640 by 480 [[pixel]] resolution with backlighting (for laptop use)
** Reflective “sunlight readable” monochrome mode with 1100 by 830 pixel resolution (for ebook reading outdoors—this is 200&nbsp;dpi)
* 128&nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] of [[DRAM]]
* 512&nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] of [[flash memory]]
* Wireless networking using an “Extended Range” 802.11b wireless chipset run at a low bitrate (2&nbsp; Mbit/s) to minimize power consumption.
* Conventional layout alphanumeric keyboard localized for the country of use.
* Touchpad for mouse control and handwriting input
* Built-in stereo speakers
* Built-in microphone
* Audio based on the AC97 codec, with jacks for external stereo speakers and microphones, Line-out, and Mic-in
* 3 external [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports.
* Power sources: 
** [[Alternating current|AC]] Cord that doubles as carrying strap
** two C (R14) or D size rechargable [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and a [[crank (mechanism)|hand-crank generator]] 
** four C (LR14) or D (LR20) alkaline [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].

====Intentionally omitted features====
* no motor driven moving parts
** no hard disk drive
** no optical drive (e.g. CDROM or DVD drive)
** no floppy drive
* no IDE interface (as there are no drives to interface with)
* no [[PCMCIA]] card slot

====Power consumption====
The power consumption design target is 2&nbsp;W to 3&nbsp;W total power consumption for the device in laptop mode. Consumption in ebook mode is estimated to be four to six times less.

The minimum acceptable crank time to operating time is 1:10, i.e. one minute of cranking the generator powers 10 minutes of operation. The hoped-for power consumption in ebook mode is 1:40 to 1:60, i.e. one minute of cranking powers 40 minutes to one hour of ebook reading. Until a complete working prototype is evaluated, these figures remain rough estimates.

In ebook mode, all hardware sub-systems are powered down except the monochrome display (including any display backlighting). When the user moves to a different page the system wakes up, draws the new page on the display and then goes back to sleep.

====Display====
The first-generation OLPC laptops are expected to have a novel low-cost [[TFT LCD]] display. Later generations of the OLPC laptop are expected to use low-cost, low-power and high-resolution [[electronic paper]] displays.

The [[TFT LCD]] display is the most expensive component of the OLPC Laptop. In April 2005, Negroponte hired [[Mary Lou Jepsen]]—who is expected to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2006—as OLPC [[Chief Technology Officer]]. Jepsen is developing a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, which is [http://laptop.org/faq.html derived] from the design of small LCD displays used in portable DVD players, which she estimated would cost about $35.

Jepsen has described the removal of the filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new [[liquid crystal display]]. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic [[diffraction grating]] and lenses on the rear of the LCD display to illuminate the colored subpixels. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make [[DVD]]s. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding R, G or B subpixels. This innovation results in a much brighter display and a corresponding reduction in backlight illumination: While the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 80% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light.{{fact}}

The remainder of the LCD display uses existing display technology and can be made using existing manufacturing equipment. Even the masks can be made using combinations of existing materials and processes. 

The display is transmissive with backlighting when used in color/DVD mode. The conventional [[cold cathode]] [[fluorescent lamp]] backlighting, which accounts for 30% of the cost of a conventional LCD, has been replaced with a lower-power, less fragile alternative such as white [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s for use at low light levels. This form of backlighting should also improve the [[color gamut]] of the display.

The display is a reflective display (with no backlighting) when used in monochrome mode for displaying ebook pages.

It is unclear what mechanism is used to switch the display from monochrome to color/DVD mode. 
It is clear from the photographs at the [http://laptop.org/laptop-images.html OLPC web site] that the mode change occurs with a change in use of the device. The [http://laptop.org/images/laptop-hands.jpg landscape format color display] is used in laptop mode, whereas the [http://laptop.org/images/laptop-ebook.jpg portrait format monochrome display] in ebook mode, so the displayed pages can be “read vertically like a book”. This is the so-called [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501546.html “curl-up-in-bed mode”] to enable reading of ebooks for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight.

It is also unclear how the pixels in the 1100 by 830 monochrome portrait display map to the color subpixels in the 640 by 480 color (or DVD) landscape display. Negroponte has [http://www.andycarvin.com/podcasts/negropontelaptop.mp3 said] at the Technology Review’s Fifth Annual Emerging Technologies Conference that the monochrome display has four times the [[resolution]] of the color display. In current [[TFT LCD]] displays, each RGB color pixel is composed of three one-third width subpixels of each color that are one pixel tall. But in this display, it seems likely that a four-pixel square block in monchrome mode becomes a single color pixel in color/DVD mode. The mapping of the four pixels to three colors might use a 2 by 2 square RG-GB sub-pixel arrangement like that of the [[Bayer filter]] used in [[Digital cameras]] to enhance the perceived brightness of the display. Perhaps two different green-hued subpixels are used to expand the display’s [[color gamut]]. The display dimensions do not quite match up with the display dimensions given by Jepson, though one can see that 1100 is close to twice 640 and 830 is close to twice 480. It is possible that this is the result of the current prototype using a current standard SVGA screen but the production version display may have 1280 by 960 monochrome pixels.

The dual-mode display was not operational in the WSIS prototype. The prototypes were shown with conventional transmission TFT LCD displays.

====Central processing unit====
The architecture, processor name or model number for the laptop has not been specified. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] is a funding partner for the One Laptop Per Child project and is expected to provide the CPU for the laptop. Negroponte has repeatedly mentioned a 500&nbsp;MHz AMD CPU in his talk and Jepson stated in a video interview that a “special 500&nbsp;MHz CPU by AMD” with “0.25&nbsp;W power consumption” would be used as the CPU.

Many people have assumed that the CPU architecture must be compatible with the [[Intel]] [[x86]] instruction set though this has not been confirmed by those associated with the project. If true the obvious candidate is the AMD [[Geode (processor)|Geode]]™ Processor Family™<ref>[http://www.gettysfamily.org/wordpress/?p=11 “$100 Laptop / OLPC (One Laptop Per Child)”] ''Jim Gettys'' (OLPC's [[Jim Gettys]]), accessed [[December 16]], [[2005]].</small></ref>. The 500&nbsp;MHz AMD Geode LX 800@0.9W™ processor is the lowest power Geode CPU but it has typical power consumption of 1.6&nbsp;W (and a maximum power of 2.4&nbsp;W) at 500&nbsp;MHz. Typical power consumption is six times higher than the target mentioned by Jepson and is close to the total power budget for the whole laptop. This CPU is built with 0.13 micrometre process. Even considering a process change which might bring the power down to 1.1&nbsp;W for the same chip built on a 90 nm process chip or 0.8&nbsp;W for a 65&nbsp;nm process chip the chip seems not to be viable. It seems unlikley that this is the CPU under consideration.

A less obvious but perhaps more plausible candidate is the AMD
[http://www.amd.com/us-en/ConnectivitySolutions/ProductInformation/0,,50_2330_6625,00.html Alchemy™ Processor Family]. This processor family uses a [[MIPS architecture]] with a MIPS32™ Instruction Set. For example, the 
[http://www.amd.com/us-en/ConnectivitySolutions/ProductInformation/0,,50_2330_6625_6012%5E6654,00.html AMD Alchemy™ Au1100™ Processor] seems to be a good candidate for this design. Power consumption for this processor is less than 200&nbsp;mW at 333&nbsp;MHz rising to 500&nbsp;mW at&nbsp;500 MHz. Running at 400&nbsp;MHz, it matches the power budget of 0.25&nbsp;W mentioned by Jepson. In addition, this processor has idle and sleep power saving modes and pseudo-static design that enables the clock to be run at any rate down to DC to save power. This flexibility enables other power saving schemes to be implemented. In addition to the MIPS CPU core this [[system-on-a-chip]] also includes an on-chip LCD controller, a USB device and host controller, SDRAM and flash memory controller and several other controllers useful in a laptop design. All of these features would keep laptop cost low by both reducing the need for other components and reducing manufacturing costs. The 
[http://www.amd.com/us-en/ConnectivitySolutions/ProductInformation/0,,50_2330_6625_12409%5E12410,00.html AMD Alchemy™ Au1200™ Processor] might be potential candidate providing both [[USB]] 2.0 Full Speed controllers and a [[DDR|DDR1/DDR2]] RAM controller though these options might be more power intensive.  The primary limitation of either of these processors, however, would seem to be the lack of a hardware [[FPU]].

The final system-on-a-chip used may well be an addition to AMD's current products and might include the wireless network controller.

====Wireless networking====
[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[802.11|802.11b]] support will be provided using a [[Wi-Fi]] “Extended Range” chipset. Jepson has said the wireless chipset will be run at a low bitrate, 2&nbsp;[[Mbps]] maximum rather than the usual higher speed 5.5&nbsp;Mbps or 11&nbsp;Mbps to minimize power consumption.

Whenever the laptop is powered on it will participate in a [[mobile ad-hoc network]] with each node operating in a [[peer-to-peer]] fashion with other laptops it can hear and forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud has access to the [[Internet]] (either directly or indirectly) then all computers in the cloud will be able to access the net. The data rate across this network will not be high but similar networks like the store and forward [http://dailywireless.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2003 Motoman project] have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications such as email to communicate outside the cloud rather than interactive uses, like web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming. Interactive network communication should be possible inside the cloud.

The conventional IEEE [[802.11]] system only handles traffic within a local cloud of wireless devices in a manner similar to an [[Ethernet]] network. Each node transmits and receives its own data but does not route packets between two nodes that cannot communicate directly. Which additional protocols the OLPC laptop will use to form a [[wireless mesh network]] is not known.

It is unclear if the laptop will join the wireless mesh network if it is in eBook mode.

====Keyboard and Touchpad====
Negroponte and Jepson have said the keyboard will be changed to suit local needs to match the standard keyboard for the country in which it is used. Some versions of prototype was shown at [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] with a detachable keyboard (tethered by a cord). Others had an attached keyboard that could be folded flat onto the back of the display. It is not clear if the detachable keyboard is part of the final design especially as some of the usage techniques described by Negroponte (“accordian-like” key use in eBook mode) seem at odds with a detachable keyboard. 

Beneath the keyboard is a large dark area that resembles a very wide [[touchpad]] that Jepson refered to as the “mousepad”. Negroponte has said that this device can be used for “[[calligraphy]]” presumably to support languages that use [[ideogram|ideograms]]. This also implies that it will support both fingers and pen-like devices. This extended touchpad might also play a part in the “accordian-like” use in eBook mode for moving to the next and previous pages. The trackpad was not operational in the WSIS prototype.

====Enclosure====
The keyboard hinges around the battery/generator compartment to close on the display bezel surrounded by the carrying handle. Negroponte has said in the closed laptop the keyboard and display are [[Hermetic seal|hermetic]]ally sealed to prevent the ingress of dust and water.

===Software===
[[Image:Olpc2 cambodia.JPG|200px|thumb|School children in a remote [[Cambodia]]n school where a pilot laptop program has been in place since 2001]]
All of the [[computer software|software]] on the $100 Laptop will be [[open-source]]. The projected software [[as of 2005|as of November 2005]] is:
* [[Red Hat]] [[Linux]] variant as [[operating system]]
* A [[web browser]]
* A [[word processor]]
* An [[email]] program
* A [[programming]] system, including the [[Squeak]] programming language

[[Steve Jobs]] had offered [[Mac OS X]] free of charge for use in the laptop, but according to [[Seymour Papert]], a professor emeritus at MIT who is one of the initiative's founders, the designers want an operating system that can be tinkered with: “We declined because it’s not open source”<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113193305149696140-442o71jo_IlBrLpyUeeOdsqDs7E_20061113.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top “The $100 Laptop Moves Closer to Reality”]  ''Wall Street Journal'', accessed [[December 1]], [[2005]].</small></ref>. Therefore Linux was chosen. [[Microsoft]]’s [[Bill Gates]] had attempted to convince Negroponte to use a version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on the laptop, but Negroponte turned him down. Some of Negroponte’s friends told him Microsoft might then attempt to craft its own version of the laptop, but he responded such a development would be “great”{{fact}}, as it would speed up the process of delivering cheap laptops.

Negroponte has also said he would like to see [[Wikipedia]] on the $100 laptop. [[Jimmy Wales]], one of the cofounders of Wikipedia, feels that Wikipedia is one of the “[[killer app]]s” for this device<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/archivedecember14&oldid=31599168#.24100_computer “User talk:Jimbo Wales”], ''Wikipedia'', accessed [[December 19]], [[2005]].</small></ref>. A number of [[open-source]] [[textbooks]] need to be written in order for the $100 laptop to achieve its educational goals. Alternately, mainstream publishers may release electronic copyrights to their books at a low enough cost that non-open source textbooks could be used.

====Thailand deployment====

The software for the laptop’s deployment in Thailand, one of the first countries to participate in the program, tentatively includes Linux with the [[GNOME]] desktop, [[Abiword]] for a word processor, either [[Firefox]] or [[Epiphany (web browser)|Epiphany]] for browsing the web, [[GAIM]] for instant messaging and [[Totem (media player)|Totem]] for the playback of audio and video. The complete list of software can be found [http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/Thailand_software_list here.]

==Criticism==

Though generally well received at early stages, the project has been criticized as unrealistic. 

At the [[UN]] conference in Tunisia, several [[Africa]]n officials, most notably [[Marthe Dansokho]] of [[Cameroon]] and [[Mohammed Diop]] of [[Mali]] were suspicious of the motives of the project, and claimed that the project was using an overly American mindset that presented solutions not applicable to specifically African problems.

Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities:

“African women who do most of the work in the countryside don't have time to sit with their children and research what crops they should be planting...What is needed is clean water and real schools.” <ref name="cnnwindup">[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/12/01/laptop/ “The $100 laptop — is it a wind-up?”]  ''CNN'', accessed [[December 1]], [[2005]].</small></ref>

Diop specifically attacked the project as an attempt to exploit a new market under the guise of “non-profitability”: 

:It is a very clever marketing tool. Under the guise of non-profitability hundreds of millions of these laptops will be flogged off to our governments. That’s the only way of achieving the necessary economies of scale to get the price low. They’ve finally found a way of selling to a huge number of poor people. <ref name="cnnwindup"/>

On December 9, 2005, [[Intel]] Chairman [[Craig Barrett]] offered his criticism of the project:
:Mr Negroponte has called it a $100 laptop—I think a more realistic title should be “the $100 gadget”... The problem is that gadgets have not been successful... It turns out what people are looking for is something that has the full functionality of a PC. Reprogrammable to run all the applications of a grown-up PC .... not dependent on servers in the sky to deliver content and capability to them, not dependent for hand cranks for power.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP263515.htm “World's poorest don’t want ‘$100 laptop’: Intel”]  ''Reuters'', accessed [[February 2]], [[2006]]</ref>

Much of this criticism is based on Negroponte’s own rhetoric. He has suggested the laptop for use in extremely poor countries, whereas the most probable users would be in moderately developed places, such as [[rural]] [[China]].

On March 15, 2006, after having introduced the [[Ultra Mobile PC]], [[Bill Gates]] mocked the project, saying “If you are going to go have people share the computer, get a broadband connection and have somebody there who can help support the user, geez, get a decent computer where you can actually read the text and you're not sitting there cranking the thing while you're trying to type.”<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060316/tc_nm/microsoft_gates_dc "Bill Gates mocks MIT's $100 laptop project"] ''Yahoo News'', accessed [[March 15]], [[2006]]</ref>

Also Red Hat is taking some heat <ref>[http://www.theregister.com/2006/04/10/fleury_redhat_critic/ ‘Red Hat wraps Linux in sh*t,’ says new exec], ''The Register'', [[2006-04-10]]</ref>
for wraping Linux up in “proprietary sh*t.” For those critics it must be unacceptable to see Red Hat be piggybacked into an unsuspecting Africa.

===Environmental Impact===

The project has also received criticism due to the environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in computers <ref>[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003881.html How Much E-Waste Per Child?], ''WorldChanging'', [[December 19]], [[2005]]</ref>. Many nations and organizations are working towards the development of “[[Green Electronics]]” (e.g European Union with [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|WEEE]])<ref>[http://articles.jimtrade.com/1/50.htm Era of Green Electronics], ''JimTrade'', [[August 20]], [[2005]]</ref>. While any project on this scale will have [[environmental impact]], OLPC has asserted that it is aiming to use as [[environmentally friendly]] materials as they can; also that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories will be fully [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] compliant; and that the laptop will use an order of magnitude less power than the typical consumer laptops available today (as of 2006), reducing the environmental burden of power generation.<ref>[http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/OLPC_FAQ OLPC Frequently Asked QuestionsQ], ''OLPC Wiki'', accessed [[April 25]], [[2006]]</ref>.

===Market===

Some people are criticizing the idea of not selling the $100 laptop on the open market.

A concerned blogger writes, “'''Sell the $100 laptop in open market and use royalty to fund free laptops to poor children''': I don't understand why OLPC doesn't want to sell in open markets, and why the manufacturing contract has to be exclusive to specific manufacturer(s). By doing this, OLPC is not unleashing the power of the markets. Such a sound concept as $100 laptop, when complemented by the market, will work exponentially well. I suggest a system where the design is made close to open source, and any manufacturer can use the design, and they can make improvements. However, the manufacturers should agree to submit any design or function improvements to the MediaLabs, in return for the original design. The MediaLabs should collect royalty as a percentage of sales, and use it to fund free or subsidized laptops for children of poor countries.” <ref>[http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/Other_Ideas#Sell_them.21_Make_them_a_symbol_of_global_activism “Sell them!

:* ''“One laptop per child: Children are your most precious resource, and they can do a lot of self-learning and peer-to-peer teaching. Bingo. End of story.”'' ―[[Nicholas Negroponte]].
