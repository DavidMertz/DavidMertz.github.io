'''''The Castle''''' is a philosophical novel by [[Franz Kafka]].  The Plot introduction and summary may be found at the generic article ''[[The Castle]]''.

The purpose of this article is to provide specific details about the translation available by [[Edwin Muir|Edwin]] and Willa Muir, hereinafter the "Muir translations".

==History of translation==
In 1930 Willa and Edwin Muir translated the First German edition of ''The Castle'' as it was compiled by [[Max Brod]]. It was published by [[Secker & Warburg]] in England and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States.

1941 edition was the edition that fed the Kafka post-war craze.  The 1941 edition included a homage by [[Thomas Mann]].

In 1954 the "Definitive" edition was published and included additional sections Brod had added to the [[Schocken Books|Schocken]] Definitive German edition. The new sections were translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser. Some edits were made in the Muir text namely the changes were "Town Council" to "Village Council" , "Superintendent" to "Mayor", "Clients" to "Applicants" <ref name=CastleMuir_vii>''The Castle'', Alfred A. Knopf, 1968, New York, New York, Publisher's note page ''vii'' </ref>.

The 1994 edition, the current publication, contains a preface by [[Irving Howe]].

==Noteworthy Translation Differences==
===Spiritual Tone===
Notable in the translations are a few words of significance.

The Muir translations make use of wording that is often considered "spiritual" in nature.  In one notable example, the Muirs translate the description of the castle as "soaring unfalteringly" where [[The Castle, Critical Edition, Harman Translation|Harman]] uses "tapered decisively".<ref name="CastleSchocken_xvii"> ''The Castle'', Mark Harman, 1998,  Schocken Books, New York, New York, Translator's Preface, page xvii</ref>  Furthermore, the word "illusory" is used from the opening paragraph forward.  Some critics note this as further evidence of the bias in the translation leaning toward a mystical interpretation.<ref name="OrmsbyNov98">"Franz Kafka & the trip to Spindemuhle", Eric Ormsby, ''The New Criterion'', Nov 1998, (http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/17/nov98/ormsby.htm)</ref>

===General Flow===
The differences become obvious if the reader reads the editions in parallel.  To illustrate the opening paragraph of the Muir edition is:
:"It was late in the evening when K. arrived. The village was deep in snow. The castle was hidden veiled in mist and darkness, nor was there even a glimmer of light to show the castle was there. On the wooden bridge leading from the main road to the village, K. stood for a long time gazing into the illusory emptiness above him."

Juxtaposed to later translations:
*Harman's: 
:"It was late evening when K arrived.  The village lay under deep snow.  There was no sign of the castle hill, fog and darkness surrounded it, not even the faintest gleam of light suggested the large Castle.  K. stood a long time on the wooden bridge that leads to from the main road to the village, gazing upward into the seeming emptiness."
*Underwood's: 
:"It was late evening when K. arrived. The village lay deep in snow. Nothing could be seen of Castle Hill, it was wrapped in mist and darkness, not a glimmer of light hinted at the presence of the great castle. K. stood for a long while on the wooden bridge that led from the main road to the village, gazing up into the seeming emptiness."

===Examples of Other Wording===
In the Muir editions, the conversation at the Mayor's office repeatedly refers to the castle's officials and their processes as "efficient".  Reading this in the context of the set of gyrations between the village, multiple departments inside the castle and skepticism of the official Sordini, one might think the chapter is nothing but satire.  In the [[The Castle, Critical Edition, Harman Translation|Harman]] edition the word "precision"  is used instead removes the comical nature to the conversation (note: the Mayor is the "village council chairman" in the [[The Castle, Critical Edition, Harman Translation|Harman]] translation).
