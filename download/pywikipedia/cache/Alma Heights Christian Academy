==Origins==
'''Alma Heights Christian Academy''' is a ministry of [[Pillar of Fire Church]] International, and reflects the mission statement of its parent organization:

<blockquote>Article 11, Page 29 of the Pillar of Fire Constitution:

The purposes for which this organization is formed are the building up of the [[Kingdom of God]] in the earth through the preaching of the gospel; the publication and circulation of religious literature; the establishment and maintenance of schools for both secular and religious instruction, with all necessary adjuncts for their support and efficiency; the establishment and maintenance of churches for the spreading of the [[Gospel]]; the engaging in works of education, benevolence, patriotism, charity, and missions everywhere, and the building up of [[Christian]] character among all people.
</blockquote>

Property for the establishment of a Christian school was purchased in [[1949]]-[[1951]] in [[Pedro Valley]], later to become the city of [[Pacifica, California]].  Alma Heights Christian Academy opened in [[1955]] as a combination boarding and day school with an enrollment of 20 students.  The boarding school was closed in the spring of [[1965]] because the population of Pacifica had increased so that a greater demand for day students had materialized.

==Enrollment and Graduates==
Alma Heights students range from kindergarten through twelfth grade. The [[2005]]-[[2006]] enrollment of the school is approximately 350 students, of which over one-hundred twenty are high school students.  The high school subscribes to the [[University of California]] prescribed curriculum, and graduates are accepted by many schools, including the University of California system. Over ninety-percent of Alma Heights graduates attend a college or university.

==Facilities==
The campus is located on over forty acres of beautiful property along [[San Pedro Creek]] with hills and a view of [[Montara Mountain]]. The school property now provides buildings on two campuses, one campus on each side of Linda Mar Boulevard.  The Seville Campus includes the first completed building, and houses the kindergarten through fourth grade. The White Field Campus includes fifth through twelfth grade in separate buildings. The last two buildings to be added to the campus were fully occupied during the 2005-2006 school year. These comprise of (1) an official-sized gymnasium which also includes classrooms, a commercial-sized kitchen, men's and women's shower/restrooms, a conference room, and workshops; and (2) a library which also includes a computer lab, science lab and lecture rooms, and offices.  

==Accreditation==
Alma Heights maintained membership with CACS throughout its early history, which then developed into the [[Association of Christian Schools International]] (ACSI).  Alma Heights achieved accreditation with the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC) in early [[2003]], and the school is seeking dual accreditation with WASC and ACSI within the next five years.
