The '''2005 Atlantic hurricane season''' was the most active [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]] in recorded history, shattering previous records on repeated occasions. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with at least 2,280 deaths and record damages of over $100 billion [[United States dollar|USD]]. Of the storms that made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], the five of the seven [[Tropical cyclone#Categories and ranking|major hurricanes]] that did so<!-- Beta did not make landfall as a major hurricane -->&mdash;[[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]], [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]], [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]]&mdash;were responsible for most of the destruction. The [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Quintana Roo]] and [[Yucatán]] and the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Florida]] and [[Louisiana]] were each struck twice by major hurricanes; [[Cuba]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Haiti]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]], and [[Tamaulipas]] were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the United States' [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], where a 30-foot (10 meter) [[storm surge]] from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that inundated [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline, and in [[Guatemala]], where [[Hurricane Stan]] combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides.

The season officially began on [[June 1]] [[2005]], and lasted until [[November 30]], although effectively the season persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] and [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category 5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Among these Category 5 storms were Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], the former the costliest and the latter the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. [[William M. Gray]] and his associates at [[Colorado State University]] (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Dr. Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season.

===Preseason forecasts===
On [[December 3]], [[2004]], Dr. Gray's team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the [[East Coast of the United States]] and the [[Florida]] peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 season]].<ref name="csu-dec2004"/> On [[April 1]], [[2005]], after confirming that [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] conditions would not develop, Dr. Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.<ref>{{

On [[May 16]], [[2005]], 15 days before the season began, NOAA issued its outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal activity. The [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) value for the season was predicted to be 120&ndash;190% of the median.<ref>{{

}}</ref>

===Midseason outlook===
On [[August 2]], after an extraordinarily active early season, the NOAA released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season, significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity.<ref>{{

{{anchor|Hurricane Katrina}}[[Hurricane Katrina]] formed in mid-August over [[the Bahamas]]. It became a tropical storm on [[August 24]] and reached hurricane intensity before making landfall in south [[Florida]] as a minimal hurricane. A few hours later, the storm entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and intensified rapidly into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane]] while crossing the [[Loop Current]] on [[August 28]]. Katrina made landfall on [[August 29]] near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] as an extremely large Category 3 hurricane. Storm surge caused catastrophic damage along the coastlines of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Alabama]]. Levees separating [[Lake Pontchartrain]] from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] were breached by the surge, ultimately flooding about 80% of the city. Wind damage was reported well inland, impeding relief efforts. Katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least $81.2 billion in damages, making it the costliest recorded hurricane in U.S. history. It was the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]], killing at least 1,836 people.<ref name="KatrinaTCR">{{

==Deaths and damage==
[[Image:Beach front home damaged by hurricane dennis 2005.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Damage in [[Navarre Beach]], Florida from [[Hurricane Dennis]]]]
The storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life. Total damages are estimated to be over $100 billion (2005 [[United States dollar|USD]]), and at least 2,280 people have been confirmed dead.

The hardest-hit area was the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|United States Gulf Coast]] from eastern [[Texas]] to the [[Florida Panhandle]]. First to strike the area was Hurricane Dennis, which caused $2.23 billion in damages along the Florida Panhandle.<ref name="DennisTCR"/> [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf Coast, devastating a long stretch of coast along [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Alabama]] with a 30-foot (9&nbsp;m) storm surge. Wind damage was reported well inland, slowing down recovery efforts. Storm surge also breached levees in the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], flooding about 80% of the city. Total damages have been estimated at $81.2 billion, and at least 1,836 people were killed by the storm; Katrina is the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, surpassing 1992's [[Hurricane Andrew]], and the deadliest hurricane in the U.S. since 1928.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/><ref>{{

In October the remnants of Tropical Storm Tammy and Subtropical Depression Twenty-two met over the [[Northeastern United States]], causing [[Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005|intense flooding]].

Southeastern [[North Carolina]] suffered some damage from the slow-moving [[Hurricane Ophelia (2005)|Hurricane Ophelia]]; damages from that storm were originally estimated at $1.6 billion, but finalized at only $70 million. The remainder of the Atlantic coast escaped the major storms, although some regions were affected by the remnants of several storms (including Katrina, Ophelia, Tammy, Subtropical Depression 22, and Wilma).<ref name="OpheliaTCR"/>

Northeastern Mexico, including [[Veracruz]] and [[Tamaulipas]], was struck repeatedly. Hurricane Emily struck Tamaulipas directly, causing severe damage. Tropical Storms Bret, Gert, and Jose also made landfall in the area but caused minimal damage, although they did cause 12 deaths.<ref name="JoseTCR"/>

Southern Mexico, along with portions of Central America, suffered heavy flooding and mudslides from [[Hurricane Stan]] and nearby nontropical rains. Over 2,000 people have been confirmed dead in total, with some towns completely wiped out, though most of these deaths were not related to the hurricane. Central America also suffered flooding from [[Tropical Storm Gamma (2005)|Tropical Storm Gamma]] and Hurricane Wilma, and [[Nicaragua]] was struck directly by [[Hurricane Beta (2005)|Hurricane Beta]]. No damage figures are available for any of these storms.

[[Image:CAROLINA BEACH.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding in [[Carolina Beach, North Carolina]] after [[Hurricane Ophelia]] in September 2005]] 

The island of [[Hispaniola]] escaped the worst storms; however, at least 89 people were killed in [[Haiti]] from the effects of Hurricanes Dennis and Wilma and [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]].

[[Cuba]] was struck by Hurricane Dennis at peak strength, causing $1.4 billion in damages; it was the worst hurricane to hit Cuba in over 40 years. Some areas of Cuba also suffered heavy damage from Hurricanes Rita and Wilma.<ref name="DennisTCR"/>

Unusual impacts were felt in [[Europe]] and nearby islands from four storms. [[Hurricane Maria (2005)|Hurricane Maria]] intensified and affected northern Europe as a vicious extratropical storm, while [[Hurricane Vince (2005)|Hurricane Vince]] maintained tropical characteristics onto the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as a weak tropical depression. [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)|Tropical Storm Delta]] struck the [[Canary Islands]] just after becoming extratropical, causing extensive damages before reaching [[Morocco]] as a weak extratropical system. In addition, the [[Azores]] were affected by the unnamed subtropical storm at its peak strength. Eight people were killed by those storms, and significant damage was reported as a result of Maria and Delta, although no figures are available.

No major land effects were felt as a result of Franklin, Harvey, Irene, Tropical Depression 10, Lee, Nate, Philippe, Tropical Depression 19, Epsilon, or Zeta.

==Economic impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Rita's Path at Landfall.gif|thumb|[[Hurricane Rita]] at landfall, along with the location of several refineries]]
The level of activity of the season had far-reaching economic consequences. Because of the vulnerability of both oil extracting and [[refining]] capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, storms led to speculative spikes in the price of [[petroleum|crude oil]]. The damage to refinery capacity in the [[United States]] caused gasoline to soar to record prices (even adjusted for [[inflation]]). Governments in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum, and shortages were reported in the days after [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] in areas heavily dependent on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] for refined gasoline. Even weeks after the storm, prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over one million barrels per day.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

[[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] damaged wells in the western Gulf of Mexico which were primarily exploratory, leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come. Additionally, as the storm churned in the Gulf, forecasters predicted that it would strike [[Houston, Texas]], the location of many major [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] that survived Katrina, leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed. In Georgia, Governor [[Sonny Perdue]] declared "[[snow day]]s" on [[September 26]] and [[September 27]] [[2005]], at all Georgia public schools to conserve fuel for [[school bus]]es in anticipation of Rita's impact. However, as the storm veered away from Houston shortly before landfall, damage to refining capacity was not as great as feared.<ref name="RitaTCR" />

Agriculture in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season. Early in the season, [[Hurricane Dennis]] caused significant damages to various [[citrus]] and [[vegetable]] crops in [[Cuba]], though the damages were not crippling.<ref name="DennisTCR" /> In [[Central America]], [[Hurricane Stan]] and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20 inches (500 mm) of rain, causing, in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides, heavy damage to crops, especially to the [[banana]] and [[coffee]] crops, which were nearly ready to be harvested. This caused significant economic disruption in [[Guatemala]] and surrounding nations, as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana crops.<ref name="StanTCR" /> When [[Hurricane Beta]] struck [[Nicaragua]] later in the season, it also caused heavy damages to the banana crop, but the harvests had already ended, mitigating economic disruption.<ref name="BetaTCR" />

Katrina also had significant political consequences, as President [[George W. Bush]], [[Louisiana]] governor [[Kathleen Blanco]], and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] mayor [[Ray Nagin]] all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. On [[December 14]], [[2005]], congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit. In addition, [[Michael D. Brown|Michael Brown]], head of the United States [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to Katrina.

==Forecasting uncertainty==
[[Image:2005_10_09_1200_rgb_12-12-0.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Vince]] formed in cold waters in the northeast Atlantic.]]
A number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters' ability to make correct predictions. [[Hurricane Vince (2005)|Hurricane Vince]] formed farther northeast in the Atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record, and then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane.<ref name="VinceTCR" /> [[Hurricane Wilma]] became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes on record, and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong [[wind shear]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Masters | first = Jeff | year = 2005 | url = http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=210&tstamp=200510 | title = Wilma strengthens, heads out to sea | accessdate = 2006-04-03}}</ref> [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)|Tropical Storm Delta]], [[Hurricane Epsilon (2005)|Hurricane Epsilon]] and [[Tropical Storm Zeta (2005)|Tropical Storm Zeta]] all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern Atlantic, much like Hurricane Vince (though at lower latitudes). All three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear, and Epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation. Epsilon became the longest-lasting December hurricane<ref name="EpsilonTCR"/> while Zeta became the longest-lasting storm in January.<ref name="ZetaTCR" />

During the season 28 storms formed (27 named and one unnamed), surpassing almost all records for storm formation in the Atlantic. More tropical storms, hurricanes, and Category 5 hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded Atlantic season; the only major record for number of storms the season did not capture was most major hurricanes, still held by the [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season|1950 season]].

The season was the first season to use "V" and "W" names, and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], forecasters resorted to using letters from the [[Greek alphabet]] for the first time (although [[Tropical Storm Alpha (disambiguation)|Alpha]] and [[Tropical Storm Delta (disambiguation)|Delta]] had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s).

Almost every storm in 2005 has set a record for early formation. Of the twenty-eight storms which formed, twenty-two of them qualified as the earliest-forming storm of that number; starting with [[Hurricane Dennis]], almost every storm was such.

===Intense storms===
[[Image:Wilma1315z-051019-1kg12.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity of 882 [[mbar]]]]
Three of the six most intense hurricanes on record formed in 2005, topped off by Hurricane Wilma's 882 [[bar (unit)|mbar]] minimum pressure, shattering the 17-year-old record set by [[Hurricane Gilbert]].<ref name="WilmaTCR"/> Hurricanes Emily, Katrina and Rita also attained Category 5 intensity, and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina became the fourth and sixth most intense recorded Atlantic storms, respectively. Hurricane Emily was not originally recorded as a Category 5 storm, but it was upgraded in the post-storm analysis by the [[National Hurricane Center]].<ref name="EmilyTCR">{{cite web| author=National Hurricane Center| year=2006| title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Emily| publisher=NOAA| accessdate=2006-03-13| url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL052005_Emily.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref> The  2005 season is the only season on record with four Category 5 storms on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]; the previous record was only two. In addition, Hurricane Dennis reached Category 4 status, tying the record set by the {{tcseason|1999|Atlantic|hurricane}} with five Category 4 storms.

===Early strength and activity===
In July, [[Hurricane Dennis]] became the strongest storm to form prior to August and the earliest Category 4 storm to form in the Caribbean.<ref name="DennisTCR"/> When [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] reached Category 5 intensity later in the month, the 2005 season became the only season to have two hurricanes reach Category 4 intensity before the end of July; Emily also broke Dennis's nine-day-old record for the strongest storm on record before August. Emily was also the first Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in July and the earliest by nearly three weeks (beating [[Hurricane Allen]]). The high level of activity and strength was reflected in the [[accumulated cyclone energy]] value at the end of July; at 63 it was the highest ever.

Additionally, seven storms formed before the end of July, breaking the record of five set in the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]], [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]], [[1936 Atlantic hurricane season|1936]], [[1959 Atlantic hurricane season|1959]], [[1966 Atlantic hurricane season|1966]], and [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]] seasons. Five of those storms formed ''during'' July, also a new record.

===Late activity===
After forming on [[November 29]], [[Hurricane Epsilon (2005)|Hurricane Epsilon]] became the longest-lasting December hurricane on record when it maintained hurricane strength from [[December 2]] to [[December 7]]. Epsilon is the third-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the month of December; only [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Nicole|Hurricane Nicole]] of 1998 and an unnamed storm in the [[1925 Atlantic hurricane season|1925 season]] were stronger.

When [[Tropical Storm Zeta (2005)|Tropical Storm Zeta]] formed on [[December 30]], it came second only to [[Hurricane Alice]] (also [[December 30]], [[1954]], but later in the day) as the latest ever that the last storm of the season formed. Zeta also became only the second storm, after Alice, to persist through the end of year and still be active at the start of the next. In addition, Zeta was the longest-lived tropical cyclone to form in December and cross over into the next year, and it was also the longest-lived January tropical cyclone.

==Storm names==
{{hurricane main|Lists of tropical cyclone names}}

The following names were used for tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the North Atlantic in 2005. This was the same list used for the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season|1999 season]], with the exceptions of Franklin and Lee, which replaced [[Hurricane Floyd|Floyd]] and [[Hurricane Lenny|Lenny]]. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms were named Franklin, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, Wilma, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Zeta for the first time in 2005 (the names Alpha and Delta had been previously used in [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season|1972]] for two [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical storms]], but this is the first time they have been used in this way). This season used fifteen previously unused names, the most ever in an Atlantic season.  Additionally, a subtropical storm that formed in early October was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name.

Vince and Wilma were the first named "[[V]]" and "[[W]]" storms ever in the Atlantic basin. The naming of Wilma exhausted the 2005 list, the first time in Atlantic naming history that all names in the list have been used. Beginning with Alpha, the 2005 season was the first time in Atlantic hurricane history that Greek letters were used due to the exhaustion of the primary list. <!-- Names not yet assigned are marked in <font color="grey">grey</font>.-->
