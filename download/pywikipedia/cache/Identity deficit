An '''identity deficit''' refers to the inability of a government to provide for the identity needs of its citizens, e.g. the gap between the [[European Union]]'s ability to supplant national governments and its ability to supplant national cultures and identities. It can also refer to refusal on the part of a society to discuss issues of identity for fear of unrest or for reasons of [[political correctness]]. It is argued that identity deficits can lead to explosions of nationalism or xenophobia if unaddressed identity issues accumulate without adequate public debate.

The term is also used in contemporary secular reparative therapy, as championed by leading reparative therapists Joseph Nicolosi and Charles Socarides, who hold that homosexuality is the product of a mental disorder they describe as "gender-identity deficit" caused by alienation from, and perceived rejection by, individuals of a subject's gender. This, it is argued, leads to a quest for bonding and fulfilment, oftentimes in what is perceived to be inappropriate and dysfunctional manners such as compulsive sexual gratification.
