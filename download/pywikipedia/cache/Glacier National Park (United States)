'''Glacier National Park''' is located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]], on the international border with the [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]. The park was established on [[May 11]], [[1910]] by an act of the [[United States Congress]]. Glacier National Park contains almost [[1 E9 m²|1,584&nbsp;mi² (4101&nbsp;km²)]] of pristine forest, mountains, and lakes. The [[Continental divide]] bisects the park north to south along the spine of the [[Lewis Range|Lewis]] and [[Livingston Range|Livingston]] mountain ranges. 27 glaciers are located within the park, all of which are in a general state of rapid retreat.<ref>National Park Service, Glacier National Park resources, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/geology.htm Geology], [[April 17]], [[2006]]</ref> Aside from the [[Bison]] and the [[Caribou|Woodland Caribou]], the animals that existed in the region at the time of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] are still found in the park. Today, the park is visited by close to 2 million tourists each year, yet the vast majority of the park is only seen except by those relative few that venture far beyond the main roadways.

Glacier National Park borders [[Waterton Lakes National Park]] in [[Canada]] &mdash; the two parks are jointly known as the [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], and were designated as the world's first International Peace Park in 1932. They were both designated [[Biosphere Reserve]]s in 1976 and [[World Heritage site]]s in 1995.<ref>National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/history/overview.htm Historical Overview], [[April 17]], [[2006]]</ref>
Six mountain peaks exceed 10,000&nbsp;feet (3,048&nbsp;m) with [[Mount Cleveland (Montana)|Mount Cleveland]] being the highest point. Glacier has been referred to as the "Crown of the Continent"<ref>Crown of the Continent Ecosystem Education Consortium,  [http://www.crownofthecontinent.org/ Welcome to the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem], [[April 17]], [[2006]]</ref> partly due to the existence of [[Triple Divide Peak]], which sends waters towards the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Hudson Bay]], and [[Gulf of Mexico]] [[drainage basin|watershed]]s. [[Lake McDonald]], [[Two Medicine]] Lake, [[St. Mary Lake]], and [[Lake Sherburne]] are the largest lakes while another 300 lakes are located throughout the mountains. The north fork of the [[Flathead River]] forms the western boundary of the park while its middle fork is part of the southern boundary. The [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]] provides most of the eastern boundary, while [[Lewis and Clark National Forest]] and the [[Flathead National Forest]] form the southern and western boundary. The remote [[Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex]] is within the two forests immediately south of the park. The [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] traverses the middle of the park, providing access to some of the most spectacular scenery in the U.S.

==History==
[[Image:Mountain Goat USFWS.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Mountain Goat]] is the official symbol of Glacier National Park. ''([[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]])'']]
The earliest human inhabitants of the area were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archeology of the region indicates that their presence extends back 10,000 years.<ref>Glacier National Park, [http://www.glacier.national-park.com/info.htm#esta Welcome to the Glacier National Park Information Page], (2002), URL accessed [[April 22]], [[2006]]</ref> Among the earliest tribes in the area known by name were the  [[Salish]], [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Shoshone]] and [[Cheyenne]]. The [[Blackfeet]] arrived around the beginning of the 18th century and soon dominated the eastern slopes of what later became the park, as well as the [[Great Plains]] immediately to the east. The park region provided the Blackfeet shelter from the harsh winter winds of the plains and supplemented their traditional [[Bison]] hunts with other game meat. Today, the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]] forms an eastern boundary to the existing park while the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]] is located west and south of the park boundary. In 1855, the Lame Bull Treaty established the Blackfoot Reservation which included the eastern area of the current park. To the Blackfeet, the mountains, especially [[Chief Mountain]] and the region in the southeast at Two Medicine, were considered the "Backbone of the World" and were frequented during [[vision quest]]s. In 1895, Chief White Calf of the Blackfeet authorized the sale of the mountain area, some 800,000&nbsp;acres (3,200&nbsp;km²), to the U.S. government for $1.5 million. This established the current boundary between the park and the reservation. 

While exploring the [[Marias River]] in 1806, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] came within 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) of the area that is now the park. A series of explorations after 1850 helped bring the future park area into better perspective. [[George Bird Grinnell]] came to the region in the late 1880's and was inspired by the scenery so much that he spent the next two decades working for the establishment of the park.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/history/overview.htm Establishing the park], ''Historical Overview'', URL accessed [[April 22]], [[2006]]</ref> A few years after Grinnell first visited, [[Henry L. Stimson]] and two companions, including a Blackfeet Indian, climbed the steep east face of Chief Mountain in 1892. 

In 1891, the [[Great Northern Railway (US)|Great Northern Railway]] crossed the Continental divide at [[Marias Pass]] (5,213&nbsp;ft/1,589&nbsp;m) which is along the southern boundary of the park. The Great Northern Railway, under the supervision of president Louis W. Hill (son of [[James J. Hill]]), built a number of hotels and chalets throughout the park. In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad, the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public. They lobbied the [[United States Congress]] and in 1900, the park was designated a forest preserve. Although mining was still allowed, it was not commercially successful. In the [[1910s]], to promote [[tourism]], the railway built a series of hotels and backcountry houses on a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[chalet]] theme throughout the area. Louis Hill wanted to portray Glacier National Park as "America's Switzerland", so the hotels and chalets had a Swiss style. Vacationers oftentimes would take pack trips on horseback between the lodges or utilize the seasonal stagecoach routes to gain access to the [[Many Glacier]] area in the northeast.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/pdf/mghiststr.pdf Many Glacier Hotel Historic Structures report], (2002), URL accessed on [[April 22]], [[2006]]</ref> The Great Northern Railway, in developing its "American Alps" theme, was following the example of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in [[Yellowstone]] and the [[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad]] at the [[Grand Canyon]].
[[Image:Going to the Sum Mountain 1932.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Road construction along the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] with [[Going to the Sun Mountain]] in background, 1932. ''([[National Park Service]])'']]  
The chalets, built between 1910 and 1913, included Belton, St. Mary, Sun Point, Two-Medicine, [[Sperry Chalet|Sperry]], [[Granite Park Chalet|Granite Park]], Cut Bank, and Gunsight Lake.  The railway also built [[Glacier Park Lodge]], just adjacent to the park on its east side, and the [[Many Glacier Hotel]] on the east shore of [[Swiftcurrent Lake]]. Louis Hill personally selected the sites for all of these buildings, choosing each for a dramatically different scenic backdrop and a view from every room.  Another developer, John Lewis, built the Lewis Glacier Hotel on [[Lake McDonald]] in 1913-1914.  The Great Northern Railway bought the hotel in 1930 and renamed it [[Lake McDonald Lodge]].  The chalets were planned for backcountry access via horseback or by hiking. Today, only Sperry Chalet and Granite Park Chalet are still in operation.<ref>Guthrie, C.W., (2004), ''All Aboard for Glacier'', Farcountry Press: Helena, MT, 1-56037-276-1</ref> The buildings constructed by the Great Northern Railway (Sperry and Granite Park Chalets, Many Glacier Hotel, and Two Medicine Store) are now on the list of [[National Historic Landmarks]]<ref>Harrison, Laura Soullière, [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/harrison/harrison8.htm Great Northern Railway Buildings], ''Architecture in the Parks'', National Park Service, 1986 URL accessed on [[April 20]], [[2006]]</ref> as is the Lake McDonald Lodge.<ref>Harrison, Laura Soullière, [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/harrison/harrison9.htm Lake McDonald Lodge], ''Architecture in the Parks'', National Park Service, 1986, URL accessed on [[April 20]], [[2006]]</ref>

After the park was well established and visitors began to rely more on [[automobile]]s, work was begun on the 53&nbsp;mile (85&nbsp;km) long [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]], completed in [[1932]]. Also known simply as the Sun Road, it bisects the park and is the only route that ventures deep into the parklands, going over the Continental divide at [[Logan Pass]] (6,670&nbsp;feet, 2033&nbsp;m) at the midway point. The Sun Road, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1985, was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.  Another route, along the southern boundary between the park and [[National Forest]]s is [[U.S. Route 2]] which also crosses the Continental Divide at Marias Pass and connects the towns of West Glacier and [[East Glacier Park Village, Montana|East Glacier]]. 

[[Wildfire]]s in 2003 on the west side of the continental divide burned 10% of the park. There were also extensive fires in the surrounding forests.

==Glaciers==
[[Image:Grinnell Glacier2.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[Grinnell Glacier]] with glacier retreat since 1850 of 1.1&nbsp;km (0.7&nbsp;miles) ''[[USGS]]'']]
Glacier National Park is dominated by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers that have mostly disappeared since the end of the [[Last glacial maximum|last ice age]], 15,000 years ago. The evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park in the form of [[U-shaped]] valleys, glacial [[cirque]]s, [[arete]]s  and large outflow lakes which radiate like fingers from the base of the highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, a series of warming and even a few cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the [[Little Ice Age]] which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850.<ref>Intergovernmental panel on climate change, Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis) [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/070.htm] ''Was there a Little Ice Age and a Medieval Warm Period?'' URL accessed on [[April 22]], [[2006]]</ref> During the Little Ice Age, some expansion and advance of the glaciers in the park occurred, but not nearly to the extent as was present during the ice age. Coincidentally, the park region was first explored in detail near the end of the Little Ice Age and a systematized survey began in which the number and size of glaciers was documented on maps and by photographic evidence. However, much of this work in the late 19th century was done to lure tourism into the region and in search of mineral wealth, and not due to a true desire to document glaciers. During the middle of the 20th century, these maps and photographs provided clear evidence that the 150 known glaciers in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated and in many cases, disappeared altogether.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey, [http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm Glacier Monitoring in Glacier National Park], [[April 25]], [[2003]]</ref>

The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] began a more systematic study by the mid 20th century of the remaining glaciers in the park that continues to the present day. By 2005, the number of remaining glaciers in the park was only 27 and scientists generally agree that if the current climate patterns continue, all the glaciers in the park will be gone by 2030. This [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat of glaciers]] in the park follows a worldwide pattern that has become even more accelerated since 1980. The extensive glacier retreat in the park as well as in other regions worldwide, are key indicators of climatic changes on a worldwide scale. All evidence indicates that the demise of glacial ice is indicative of [[global warming]]. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather return and persist, the [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]] (accumulation rate versus melting rate) of glaciers will continue to be negative and the glaciers will eventually disappear, leaving behind only barren rock.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior, [http://nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glacier_retreat.htm Glacier Retreat in Glacier National Park, Montana], [[April 25]], [[2003]]</ref> 
Glacier National Park is one of the foremost regions of the world in which climatic changes have been documented by researchers. [[Glaciologist]]s have documented numerous glaciers within the park. Visible from the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the [[Blackfoot Glacier]] and [[Jackson Glacier]] were one glacier in the mid 19th century. After the end of the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park retreated an average of less than 23&nbsp;feet (7&nbsp;m) per year. Between 1917 and 1926, the retreat rate rose to over 130&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) per year and in the period from 1926 to 1932, this rate of retreat exceeded 328&nbsp;feet (100&nbsp;m) annually. Over the next ten years, the rate of retreat dropped slightly to 295&nbsp;feet (90&nbsp;m) annually. From 1942 to 1979, there was a period in which the retreat rate reduced significantly, and even a small advance of a few tens of meters was experienced on some of the glaciers in the park. In 1850, the glaciers in the region near Blackfoot and Jackson Glaciers covered 5,337&nbsp;acres (21.6&nbsp;km), and by 1979, the same region of the park had glacier ice covering only 1,828&nbsp;acres (7.4&nbsp;km). Between 1850 and 1979, 73 percent of the glacial ice in the park melted away.<ref>Hall, Myrna and Fagre, Daniel, [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/iecws/materials/reading_list/03_Article_FebHall.pdf Modeled Climate-Induced glacier change in Glacier National Park, 1850-2100], ''Bioscience'' Vol. 53.2 (February 2003), URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> 

The impact of glacier retreat in the park on ecosystems is not fully known but cold water dependent plant and animal species may be impacted. Reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also impact stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and enhancing the risk of forest fires.  The loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal experienced by park visitors.

==Geology==
[[Image:Chief Mountain.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Chief Mountain]] is an isolated peak on the easternmost boundary of the park. ''([[National Park Service]])]]''
The rocks of the park are primarily [[sedimentary]] in origin, having been laid down in shallow seas over 1.6&nbsp;billion to 800&nbsp;million years ago. During the formation of the [[Rocky Mountains]] the [[Lewis Overthrust]], commencing 170&nbsp;million years ago, moved an enormous region of rocks three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) thick and 160&nbsp;miles (257&nbsp;km) long eastward more than 50 miles (80&nbsp;km).<ref>National Park Service, ''Geology'', [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/geology.htm Lewis Overthrust Fault], URL accessed on [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> This resulted in older rocks being displaced over newer ones, and today overlying Proterozoic rocks are over 1.4&nbsp;billion years older than the underlying [[Cretaceous]] age rocks. One of the most dramatic evidences of this overthrust is visible in the form of [[Chief Mountain]], an isolated peak on the edge of the eastern boundary of the park rising 4,500&nbsp;feet (1,371&nbsp;m) above the Great Plains. There are seven mountains in the park over 10,000&nbsp;feet (3,050&nbsp;m) in elevation, with [[Mount Cleveland (Montana)|Mount Cleveland]] (10,466&nbsp;ft/3,190&nbsp;m) being the tallest.

The rocks in Glacier National Park are the best preserved sedimentary rocks of Proterozoic times in the world. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other parts of the world have been greatly altered by various mountain building and other metamorphic changes, and consequently fossils are less common and are more difficult to observe. The rocks preserve such features as  millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, [[oolite]]s and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. These rocks in the park have, due to the glacially carved cliffs, one of the best locations of readily available rock strata in which to find fossils dating from the period when life on Earth is considered to have first developed. Six fossilized species of [[Stromatolite]]s, which were  early organisms consisting primarily blue-green [[algae]], have been documented in the rocks in the park and are dated at about 1&nbsp;billion years. One feature of the rocks in the park is known as the Appekunny Formation. [[Image:GlacierNP L7 20010701.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Landsat 7]] image of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. The [[Rocky Mountain Front]] formed by the [[Lewis Overthrust]] fault rises dramatically above the Great Plains on the right. ''[[NASA]]'']]This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified [[metazoan]] (animal) life on Earth. The discovery of the [[Appekunny Formation]], which is well preserved rock strata located within the park, pushed back the previously believed age for the origination of animal life a full billion years.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/glac/index.cfm Park Geology], ''Geology Fieldnotes'', (2005), URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref>

The park contains a dozen large lakes and several hundred smaller ones, with a total of 131 of them named. Numerous [[tarn (lake)|tarn]]s are located in [[cirque (landform)|cirque]]s formed by glacial erosion. Some of these lakes, like Avalanche Lake and Cracker Lake, are notably opaque turquoise in color from the suspended glacial [[silt]], and a number of streams run milky white with silt. The lakes of Glacier National Park remain cold year round with temperatures rarely found above 50 degrees Fahrenheit at their surface. Cold water lakes such as those found in the park support little [[plankton]] growth, which in turn ensures the lake waters are remarkably clear. However, the lack of plankton in the waters allows pollutants to remain longer since the filtering process is reduced. Consequently, the lakes are considered environmental "bellwethers" as they can be quickly affected by even minor increases in pollutants.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/pphtml/subnaturalfeatures19.html Lakes and Ponds], Nature and Science, URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Wildlife and ecology==
===Flora===
[[Image:Beargrass.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Beargrass]] is a tall flowering plant commonly found throughout the park. ''([[National Park Service]])'']]
Glacier is part of a large preserved [[ecosystem]] of over 8&nbsp;million acres (32,000&nbsp;km²). The parklands are bordered on the east by the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]], an area consisting primarily of the westernmost expanse of the Great Plains found in the U.S. [[Flathead National Forest]] is located to the west and the [[Great Bear Wilderness]] within [[Lewis and Clark National Forest]] is located to the south. Waterton Lakes National Park, [[Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park]], and the [[Flathead Provincial Forest]] in Canada are all found along the northern boundary of the park. In combination, the region is known as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", and is primarily untouched wilderness of a pristine quality. Virtually all the plants and animals which existed at the time white explorers first entered the region are still in existence today.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/bio1.htm#Crown The Crown of the Continent Ecosystem], ''Biodiversity'', URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]].</ref> 

The valleys and sheltered mountain sides are home to over 500 [[species]] of trees and plants. The predominantly [[coniferous]] forest is home to various species of trees such as the [[Engelmann Spruce]], [[Douglas Fir]], [[Subalpine Fir]], [[Limber pine]] and [[Western Larch]], which sheds its needles each year, unlike other conifers. [[Cottonwood]] and [[Aspen]] are the dominant [[deciduous]] trees and are found at lower elevations. The [[treeline|timberline]] on the eastern side of the park is almost 800&nbsp;feet (250&nbsp;m) lower than on the western side of the Continental Divide, due to exposure to the colder winds and weather of the Great Plains. West of the Continental Divide, the forest receives more moisture and protection from the winter resulting in the trees being taller and the forest becoming very densely populated. Above the forested valleys and mountain slopes, alpine [[tundra]] conditions prevail where grasses and small plants work hard to exist in a region that enjoys as little as three months without snow cover. Thirty species of plants are found only within the park and surrounding National Forests. [[Beargrass]], a tall flowering plant, is commonly found near moisture sources throughout the park, and is relatively widespread during July and August. Wildflowers such as Monkeyflower, Glacier Lily, [[Fireweed]], Balsamroot and [[Indian Paintbrush]] are found throughout the park.

===Fauna===
[[Image:Grizzly Bears.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The [[Grizzly bear]] is a [[threatened species]] and approximately 300 are believed to exist in the park. ''([[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]])'']]
The [[Threatened species|threatened]] [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[Canadian Lynx]] are found in the park and their numbers are historically as common as ever, however are threatened species because in virtually every other region of the U.S. outside of [[Alaska]] they are either extremely rare or absent from their historical range. On an average, one or two bear attacks on humans occur each year and since the creation of the park in 1910, there have been a total of 10 bear related deaths.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/bears2.htm#Pepper If you encounter a bear], Resources, URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> The [[American Black Bear|black bear]] is more common than the grizzly and less aggressive. Other large mammals such as the [[Rocky Mountain Goat|mountain goat]], which is the official park symbol animal, [[bighorn sheep]], [[moose]], [[Red Deer|elk]] and [[mule deer]], [[coyote]] and the rarely seen [[mountain lion]], are found park wide. Unlike [[Yellowstone National Park]], which commenced a [[Wolf]] reintroduction program in the 1990's, wolves have existed continuously in Glacier since before the arrival of man. Other mammals found in the park include [[wolverine]], [[badger]], [[river otter]], [[porcupine]], [[mink]], [[marten]], [[fisher]], six species of [[bat]]s and numerous other smaller mammals. Over 60 species of mammals in all are known to inhabit the park.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/mammalcheck.htm Mammal checklist], ''Mammals of Glacier National Park'', URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> 

260 species of birds inhabit the park, with raptors such as the threatened [[Bald eagle]] and the non threatened [[Golden eagle]], the [[peregrine falcon]], [[osprey]] and several species of [[hawk]]s residing year round. The [[Harlequin duck]] is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes throughout the park. The [[Great blue heron]], [[Tundra swan]], [[Canada goose]] and [[American Wigeon]] are other species of waterfowl commonly found. [[Great horned owl]], [[Clark's nutcracker]], [[Steller's jay]], [[Pileated Woodpecker]] and [[Cedar Waxwing]] are commonly found in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the [[Ptarmigan]],  Timberline sparrow and rosy finch are common. Populations of Clark's Nutcracker have declined in recent years as their primary food source seeds from the pinecones of [[Whitebark pine]]s, which have been greatly reduced due to an  [[exotic species]] known as blister rust.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/pphtml/subplants21.html Trees and Shrubs], ''Nature and Science'', URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

Due to the colder climate of the park, [[ectothermic]] reptiles are all but absent, with two species of [[Garter snake]]s, and the [[Painted Turtle|Western painted turtle]] being the only three reptile species proven to exist in the park. Similarly, only six species of [[amphibian]]s are documented, but that doesn't mean they are uncommon. After a forest fire in 2001, a few nearby park roads were closed for short periods of time the following year to allow thousands of [[Western toad]]s to migrate to other areas.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/pphtml/subanimals1.html Amphibians], Nature and Science, URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref>

Glacier is also home to the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Bull trout]] which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently.<ref>National Park Service, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/pdf/bulltrout.pdf Preserving Glacier's native Bull Trout], URL accessed [[April 23]], [[2006]]</ref> Other native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the [[Cutthroat Trout]], [[Northern Pike]], [[Coregonus|Mountain Whitefish]], [[Kokanee Salmon]] and [[Grayling (species)|Grayling]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Big Drift.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The [[Big Drift]] covering the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] as photographed on March 23, 2006.''([[National Park Service]])'']]
Many areas of Glacier Park are only accessible during the summer, and possibly the late spring and early fall (depending on snowfall and elevation).  Rainfall is frequent in the late summer months (the peak tourist season) and may be persistent for days.  Visiting in the early summer avoids some but not all of the wet weather. However in the spring, the nights and early mornings will be substantially cooler, and high-elevation trails will may still be snow covered. This includes the popular Hidden Lake Trail at Logan Pass. [[Thunderstorms]] are common in the park all summer, and normal safety precautions for [[lightning]] and [[hail]] should be taken.  Due to its mountainous terrain, [[Tornado|tornadoes]] are very rare inside the boundary of Glacier Park itself. The winter can bring prolonged cold waves, especially on the eastern side of the park. Snowfalls are significant over the course of the winter with higher amounts occurring in the west. Rapid temperature changes have been noted and [[Browning, Montana]], which is just east of the park in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, once experienced a world record temperature drop of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (56 °C) in only 24 hours.<ref>Guinness World Records, [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=47487 Biggest temperature difference in a day], (2005), URL accessed [[April 24]], [[2006]]</ref>

Glacier National Park has one of the premier global climate change research programs on Earth. Based in West Glacier and with the main headquarters located in [[Bozeman, Montana]], the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies for almost a decade. The research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Glacier retreat studies employing comparative photography dating back over 100 years with current photographic evidence obtained from ground and satellite based imagery is also a key aspect of the research performed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns, watershed studies where stream flow rates and temperatures are documented frequently at fixed gauging stations and atmospheric research in which [[UV-B]] radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are documented over time, all help to assemble a broader understanding of climate changes in the park over time. The data collected when compared to other facilities scattered around the world help to identify these climatic changes on a global level.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey, Fagre, Dan, [http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/global.htm Global Change Research -- A Focus on Mountain Ecosystems], ''Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center Research'', April 25, 2003, URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Fire ecology===
[[Image:GNP Wildfires 2003.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Numerous wildfires burned 10% of the park in 2003. ''([[National Park Service]])'']]
[[Wildfire|Forest fire]]s were viewed for many decades as a threat to protected areas. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960's, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of ensuring immediate suppression of all wildfires resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.<ref>Glacier National Park, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/fire_2.htm A Fire Ecosystem], ''Glacier National Park Wildland Fire Management'', URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>
Glacier National Park has a fire management plan which ensures that human caused fires are generally suppressed as they always have been. In the case of natural fires, the fire is monitored and suppression is dependent on the size and threat a fire may pose to human safety and structures. Increased population and the growth of suburban areas near parklands, has led to the development of what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management, in which the park, as do many protected areas, cooperate with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. As a result of this, houses and structures are designed to be more fire resistant, dead and down trees, also known as the fuel load, are removed near places of human habitation, reducing the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year.<ref>Glacier National Park, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/resources/fire_4.htm Wildland Urban Interface], ''Glacier National Park Wildland Fire Management'', URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

==Recreation== 
Glacier is not near any major city and the closest airport is located in [[Kalispell, Montana]] which is southwest of the park. [[Amtrak]] trains stop at East and West Glacier along the [[Seattle]] to [[Portland, Oregon]] to [[Chicago]] line (originally the Great Northern). A fleet of [[1930s]] red tour buses, called jammers, rebuilt in 2001 to run on propane, offer tours on all the main roads within the park. Small wooden tour boats, some dating back to the [[1920s]] operate on several of the larger lakes <!--  while several lodges and chalets from the Great Northern era still operate in the park. -->

[[Hiking]] is a popular activity within the park.  Over half of the visitors to the park report taking a hike on the park's nearly 700 miles of trails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/activities/hiking.htm|title=Glacier National Park - Hiking|accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> Due to the presence of bears and other large mammals, dogs are not permitted on any trails in the park, though they are permitted at front country campsites that can accessed by a vehicle and along paved roads.

Several day hiking options are available within the following areas:
* [[Lake McDonald]]
* [[Logan Pass]]
* [[Many Glacier]]
* [[St. Mary Lake]]
* [[Two Medicine]]
* North Fork of the [[Flathead River]]
* [[Goat Haunt]]

Backcountry camping is also available at campsites along the trails.  A permit is required, which can be obtained from certain visitor centers or may be submitted in advance. The backcountry is usually closed in most areas until early June due to the potential risk of [[avalanche]]s and many trails at higher altitudes are snow packed until July. The major campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most are near one of the larger lakes. The campground at [[St. Mary, Montana|St. Mary]] and at Apgar are open year round, but conditions are considered primitive in the off season as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All the campgrounds in the park that are vehicle access are usually open by mid June and remain so until mid September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/pdf/BCGuide-web.pdf|title=Glacier National Park - Backcountry Guide 2006|format=pdf|accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> Guide services and shuttle services are also available.  

[[Fishing]] is a popular activity in the park and some of the finest [[fly fishing]] in [[North America]] can be found in the streams that flow through the park. Though the park requires that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The endangered Bull Trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught, otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.<ref>Glacier National Park, [http://www.nps.gov/glac/activities/fishing.htm Fishing regulations], ''Activities'', URL accessed [[April 27]], [[2006]]</ref>

Winter recreation activities in Glacier are limited. [[Snowmobile|Snowmobiling]] is illegal in the park, but [[cross-country skiing]] is permitted in the lower altitude valleys on the east and western sides of the park.
