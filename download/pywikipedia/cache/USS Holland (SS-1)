:'''''Holland VI''' redirects here.''
'''USS ''Holland'' (SS-1)''' was the [[United States Navy]]'s first commissioned [[submarine]], named for her inventor, [[John Philip Holland]].  She was originally [[ship naming and launching|launched]] by [[Crescent Shipyard]] of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], in May 1897, at which point the vessel was known as the sixth Holland prototype, or ''Holland VI''. It was modified over the next few years and  renamed as USS ''Holland'' (SS-1) when it was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] by the U.S. Navy on [[October 12]], [[1900]], at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], with Lieutenant Harry H. Caldwell in command.

On [[October 16]], [[1900]], ''Holland'' left Newport under tow of tug ''Leyden'' for [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where she trained cadets of the [[United States Naval Academy]] as well as officers and enlisted men ordered there to receive training vital in preparing for the operation of other submarines being built for the Fleet.

''Holland'' proved valuable for experimental purposes in collecting data for
submarines under construction or contemplation. Her 166-mile surface run from
Annapolis to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[January 8]] to [[January 10]], [[1901]],
provided useful data on her performance underway over an extended period.

Except for the period [[June 15]] to [[October 1]], [[1901]], which was passed
training cadets at the Naval Torpedo Station, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], ''Holland'' remained at Annapolis until [[July 17]], [[1905]], as a training
submarine.

''Holland'' finished out her career at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Her name was
struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[November 21]], [[1910]]. She
was sold as scrap to [[Henry A. Hitner & Sons]], of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on [[June 18]], [[1913]]. Her purchaser was required to put up $5,000 bond as assurance that the submarine would be broken up and not used as a ship.
