'''Yorkshire [[colloquialisms]],''' '''Yorkshireisms''', [[dialect]], or [[slang]] are mostly spoken, but not often written, in [[Yorkshire]]. Whilst also being the name of the largest county in [[England]], Yorkshire is also the name of the distinct [[dialect]] spoken there. Yorkshire people often say, "I'm talking Yok-sha", when they are asked about their dialect. Yorkshire still has words that can be found in older versions of the English [[Bible]], such as Thee, thou, thy & thine, etc.

[[Image:Yorkshire-734x560.jpg|thumb|300px|1904 map of Yorkshire]] 
The Yorkshire dialect contains not only a unique [[glossary]] of words, but also a unique [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] which partly have origins in [[Old Norse]]. 

The main differences between Yorkshire English and [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] English is the use of the letters A and U.

The word ''bathroom'', in [[Received Pronunciation]] (hereafter known as RP) English, is pronounced as ''baarth-ruum'', whilst in Yorkshire the A is pronounced in the same way as ''athlete'': ''bath' rooom''. The word ''up'' is pronounced in RP as ''ap'' - as in apple, but in Yorkshire it is used as in the word 'through', with emphasis on the letter 'U'. 

The definite article "the", is swallowed as a silent gap in a sentence, as in, "Could you close(slightly swallowed pause)...window", or "I'm off ter (slightly swallowed pause)pub" - "I'm off to the pub"

This article lists many Yorkshire colloquialisms, in as much comprehensive detail as possible, considering the fact that it was/is a dialect that was/is rarely written down. What is clear is that [[Yorkshire]] colloquialisms are different from others, because of the way the words are said, and the melody that is used to express them. 

This page is a collection of Yorkshire words and phrases that were used in the past, and also the ones that are still being used today. The words are written down in as [[phonetic]] a way as possible, so as to make it easier for people to be able to say them out loud, although written "Yorkshire" differs somewhat.

==Yorkshire jokes==
'''Yorkshire jokes''' came about because of the harsh conditions that many Yorkshire people were forced to live with historically, and then found solace in making fun of the situation. Though conditions are no longer dire, this tradition has carried on.

Yorkshire humour is philosophical in an every-man sense; meaning gently sarcastic, self-effacing and dry. Though it can sometimes display a sly cunning, it often follows the rule that all good comedy is directed firstly at the speaker, and then at others, or a combination of both; meaning that as much as others make mistakes, or say/do silly things, it is also possible for oneself to do the same things. The laughter generated is a combination of relief that one is not the reason for the joke, but is also heart-felt sympathy for the person that the joke is directed aginst.

* "If tha' can laff... t'ole world laffs wi'-thee, bu't if tha'-crys, tha'll cry aloan."

Translation: (Laugh, and the whole world will laugh with you, but if you cry, you will cry alone).

Jokes:

*A deputy (a foreman) in the pit, had to order 50 corrugated roofing sheets.

"Ar-does tha' spell corrugated?", he asked.
"Err... jus' reet riggly-tin", his mate replied - and the only reason he could spell that was because he had a packet of chewing gum in his pocket.

("Wrigley's Chewing Gum", for the uninitiated)

* Notes to the milkman:

**"Please don't leave any milk today - all they do is drink it!"

** "Please leave an extra pint of paralysed milk." 

** "Please leave no milk today. When I say today, I mean tomorrow, because I wrote this note yesterday." 

** "When you leave the milk please put coal on't fire, let't dog out and put't newspaper inside't door. P.S. Don't leave any milk."

==Food & drink==

* ''Cheese-n-egg'' (Grated cheese with an egg on top, and a few drops of milk - on a metal plate - that is grilled until the cheese has melted and slightly browned)  
* ''Christmas cake'' (This is eaten with a slice of cheese)
* ''[[Parkin (cake)|Parkin]]'' (A type of cake normally eaten on bonfire night)
* ''Pop'' (A [[carbonated]]/fizzy drink)
* ''[[Tripe]]'' (The stomach lining of a cow, which was a favoured dish in Yorkshire, because of its cheapness)
* ''Yok-sha ot' pot'' ([http://www.brianturneronline.co.uk/recipes.asp?ID=22&Type=main%20course Yorkshire Hotpot]: Lamb, carrots, onions & potatoes)   
* ''Yok-sha puddin' '' ([[Yorkshire Pudding]]; batter-based that has nothing to do with sweet puddings)

==Poems & sayings==
* The Yorkshire version of the "See No Evil" phrase:

Hear all, see all, say nowt.

Eat all, drink all, pay nowt,

and tha ever dus owt for nowt,

All-us do it for thee-sen.

Translated:
Hear everything, see everything, but say nothing.

Eat everything, drink everything, but pay nothing,

and if you ever do anything for nothing,

always do it for yourself.


* There's niver nowt, but-what there's summat.

And when-there's summat, it's-offen nowt.

And them-that allus' thinks they're-summat,

'as-nearly allus-risen fray-nowt.

It's no-use sittin-an-waitin' for summat,

'Cos more-offen, it' nobbut' ends-wi'nowt.

An' come to-think on-it', these lines I've penned,

Are-myst-lee summat' abart-nowt

Translated:

There is never nothing, but there is always something.

And when there is something, it is often nothing.

And those that think they are something special,

have nearly always come from nothing.

It's of no use waiting for something,

because more often than not, it ends with nothing.

And if I think about it, these lines I have penned/written

are mostly something about nothing. 


* "It's not't cough tha't carries-thee-off, its'... coffin they carry thee off-in".

(It is not the cough that carries you off, it is the coffin they carry you off in)

* "All I can leave thee, is what tha' makes a'thee-sen".

(All I can leave you, after I am dead, is what you make of yourself, in life.)

* "If tha knows nowt, say nowt an-appen nob'dee 'll notice."

(If you know nothing, then say nothing, and maybe no-one will notice that you don't know anything)

==Songs==
''''''[[On Ilkla Moor Baht'at]]'''''' is possibly the most famous of Yorkshire songs. The phrase "Bar-tat" translates as, "Without a Hat".
