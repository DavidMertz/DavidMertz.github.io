'''El Palo Alto''' is a [[coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') [[tree]]  located in El Palo Alto Park on the banks of San Francisquito Creek in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[United States]]. ''El Palo Alto'', roughly translated, means ''the tall tree'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

El Palo Alto is 110 feet (33.5 meters) in height (compared to 134.6 feet or 41 meters in 1951), 90 inches (2.3 meters) in diameter, and has a crown spread of 40 feet (12 meters).

The tree is [[California Historical Landmark]] No. 2 (number 1 is the custom house in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]). It is recognized by the National Arborist Association and International Society of Arboriculture for its historical significance as "a campsite for the [[Gaspar de Portol√†|Portola]] Expedition Party of [[1769]]"; being frequented by the Coastanoan/[[Ohlone]] Indians; and for its use as a sighting tree by [[surveying|surveyors]] plotting out [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. The tree is depicted on the city of Palo Alto's official seal and on the seal of [[Stanford University]].

The tree is 1063 years old <!-- as of 2004 --> and is reportedly healthier today than 100 years ago. El Palo Alto originally had twin trunks, but a [[1887]] flood in the San Francisquito [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] tore off one of the two.

A plaque at the base of the tree bears the following inscription:

:''Under this giant redwood, the Palo Alto, November 6 to 11, 1729, camped Portola and his band on the expedition that discovered San Francisco Bay, this was the assembling point for their reconnoitering parties. Here in 1774 Padre Palou erected a cross to mark the site of a proposed mission (which later was built at Santa Clara). The celebrated Pedro Font topographical map of 1776 contained the drawing of the original double trunked tree making the Palo Alto the first official living California landmark.''
