==History==

The town's name means "white town on the sea". It was first mentioned in the [[10th century]] as a town founded by [[Medieval Croatian state|Croatian kings]]. It became the capital of Croatian kings as well as bishops, and was the city where [[Coloman of Hungary]] was coronated in [[1102]], marking Croatia's joining the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In [[1202]], when the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] occupied the city of [[Zadar|Zara (Zadar)]], many of its citizens took refuge in Biograd, after which the city was also referred to as ''Zara vecchia'' ("Old Zara").

During the 13th and 14th century the city was run by the dukes of [[Cetina]], the [[Knights Templar]] of [[Vrana]] and the dukes of [[Bribir]] the [[Šubić]]es. It was acquired by the [[Venetian Republic]] in [[1409]] and would remain its property until its downfall in [[1797]].

During the Venetian-[[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] wars, the city was gravely damaged, and on two occasions, in [[1521]] and in [[1646]], it was destroyed and burned. In the 16th and 17th century, the Croatian militia formed in Biograd and had much involvement in the wars against the Turks.

In recent history, the [[Serb]]ian forces inflicted considerable damage by long-range bombardment in the period [[1991]]-[[1993]].
