'''Venus''' is a [[Big Bang Comics]] character from Earth-B who first appeared in '''''Big Bang #1'''''.

Venus' arch foe is a [[Nazi]] spy named '''Madame X''', whose face is completely hidden by a large black veil, and receives her name from the fact that her guns fire rubber "X"s.

Venus is the [[Roman]] goddess of [[Love]] and [[Laughter]], but the drawback is that men always try to compete for her affections. Venus sometimes uses this to her advantage if the person in question is a villain, or to gain information.

During the "Criss-Cross Crisis", Venus and Thunder Girl, together with the Earth-B version of The Beacon, helped to try and foil Dr. Binanas' plan to destroy the two Earths.

Venus' superpowers range from a seashell that expands into a shield, super-strength and her beautiful singing voice to soothe peoples' anger. She is a lampoon of [[Wonder Woman]] from [[DC Comics]].
