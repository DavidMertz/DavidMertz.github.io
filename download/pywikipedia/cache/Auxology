'''Auxology''' is a meta-term covering the study of all aspects of [[human]] physical [[growth]]; though it is also a fundamental of [[biology]], generally. Auxology is a highly multi-disciplinary [[science]] involving [[health sciences]] / [[medicine]] ([[pediatrics]], [[General practitioner|general practice]], [[endocrinology]], [[neuroendocrinology]], [[Human physiology|physiology]], [[epidemiology]]), and to a lesser extent: [[nutrition]], [[genetics]], [[anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[ergonomics]], [[history]], [[economic history]], [[economics]], [[socioeconomics]], [[sociology]], [[public health]], and [[psychology]], among others.  

== Etymology ==
Auxology: aux-, pertaining to growth, from [[Greek language|Greek]] auxē, "to increase"; -o-, generic phoenetic combining form, here denoting relationship to growth, stimulation, or acceleration; -logy, pertaining to the study of or science of, from [[Middle English]] -logie, from [[Old French]], from [[Latin]] -logia, from Greek -logiā, from legein, "to speak", and -logos "word", "speech" and "one who deals with", thus "the character or department of one who speaks or treats of (a certain subject)".
