The '''American Heritage Party''', according to their [[website]], is a [[Christianity|Christian]]-based political party that is traditionally [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning in ideology.  They are against any type of [[abortion]] or [[euthanasia]], support and promote religious freedoms, are against [[gun control]] and property [[taxation|taxes]].

They are primarily based in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Washington]]. Most groups discount them nationally as having little impact as they duplicate many political stands of the more popular [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution Party]], which they splintered off of in [[2000]] for religious reasons.{{POV-statement}}

They have run only three candidates, Bruce Craswell and Lorne Blackman for Washington State Representative in 1998 and 2000 respectively, and Don Jackson for [[Columbia County, Washington|Columbia County]] [[Commissioner]] in [[2002]].

The American Heritage Party recently attracted the attention of [[The American View]] because of the recent internal dispute with the Constitution Party.
