==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Leeds]], [[Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]; his parents were poor [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] refugees. <ref name=bio/>

==Education==
Stone received a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he earned [[Bachelor of Arts ]](Jurisprudence), [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degrees. He followed this with a [[Master of Laws]] from [[Leeds University]], and then a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] from [[Harvard University]]. 

==Career==
Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to [[New Zealand]] where he worked at [[Auckland University College]]. In 1942, he was appointed Challis Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[University of Sydney]], a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest. <ref name=bio/> This early experience of [[anti-Semitism]] influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993).

In 1972, Stone moved to the [[University of New South Wales]], where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, [[The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence]]. <ref name="stone_inst"> [http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/ http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/] Home page of The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.

==Influence==
Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. Stone's courses were the only ones that broadened the thinking of most of his students.
