The '''River Ise''' is a [[river]] in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]] and a [[tributary]] of the [[River Nene]].

The river rises in the very field that hosted the [[Battle of Naseby]] at the north-western tip of Northamptonshire. Flowing east past [[Desborough]] and the [[Eleanor cross]] at [[Geddington]], it turns south and passes [[Kettering]] and [[Burton Latimer]] before joining the Nene just south of [[Wellingborough]].
