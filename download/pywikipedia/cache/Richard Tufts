'''Richard Tufts''' (born [[March 16]], 1896 in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]; died [[December 17]], 1980) was a notable figure in [[United States|American]] [[golf]] in the mid 20th century. He was a grandson of [[James Walker Tufts]], the founder of [[Pinehurst Resort]] in [[North Carolina]], which was long America's preeminent golf resort. Richard Tufts grew up in [[Massachusetts]] and attended [[Harvard]]. He served in [[World War I]] before starting work at Pinehurst with his father Leonard, and later taking over himself. He added 40 holes to the resort and hosted the 1936 [[PGA Championship]] and the 1951 [[Ryder Cup]]. He ran Pinehurst until relatives sold their stock to Diamondhead Corp., ending family control.

Tufts was a heavyweight of the golfing establishment, eventually rising to be President of the [[United States Golf Association]] in 1956-57. He was a great believer in amateurism, and had a rather patricican disapproval of any commercialisation of the sport. He was non-playing captain of the U.S team in the amateur team competition, the [[Walker Cup]] in 1963. He wrote several books about golf. In 1992 he was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].
