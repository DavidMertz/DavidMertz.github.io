'''''Syndyoceras cooki''''' is an extinct species of mammal.

The 1,50 m (5 ft) long creature closely resembled a [[deer]], having two [[claw|hooved]] toes. Similar to early [[horse]]s like ''[[Merychippus]]'' it had two [[vestigal organ|vestigal]] outer toes on each foot, which didn't touch the ground. ''Syndyoceras'''s [[skull]] decorations looked drastically different from a deer's. It had two pairs of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s. The first was a V-shaped pair on the snout, fused at the base. The second pair was placed betweem the [[eye]]s and the [[ear]]s and was curved inwards, the horns facing towards each other in a semi-circle shape. Like [[giraffe]] horns, these protrusions were covered with [[skin]]. Most likely they were used for display and fighting.
