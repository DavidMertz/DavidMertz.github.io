'''Jack Leon Ruby''' (born '''Jacob Rubenstein''' on [[March 25]]?, [[1911]] – [[January 3]], [[1967]]) was a [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] nightclub owner who murdered [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] on [[November 24]], [[1963]], two days after Oswald was arrested for the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of [[President John F. Kennedy]]. He changed his name to '''Jack Leon Ruby''' in December 1947.

== Family and early life ==
Jack Ruby was born '''Jacob Rubenstein''' to Joseph Rubenstein (1871&ndash;1958) and Fannie Turek Rutkowski or Rokowsky in [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1911. His Polish-born parents were [[Orthodox Jews]]. 

Joseph Rubenstein was born in the town of [[Sokołów Podlaski]], [[Poland]], then part of [[Imperial Russia]]. He was a [[carpenter]] as was his father. He joined the Russian army in 1893, serving in the [[artillery]]. He married while in military service. Joseph later was assigned to forces positioned in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Siberia]]. He grew to detest army life and reportedly "walked away" from it in 1898. The Rubensteins left the Russian Empire about four years later. They briefly lived in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and then [[Canada]]. They entered the [[United States]] in 1903, and the following year they settled in the heavily Jewish 24th Ward on Chicago's West Side.

Conflicting birth dates for Jacob Rubenstein, ranging March to June of 1911, were quoted by various sources and given by Ruby at various times; [[March 25]], [[1911]] is the date he most commonly gave for his own birthdate.  (Births in Chicago in 1911 were not mandatorily recorded, so there is no official record to consult.) The fifth of his parents' eight living children, he had a troubled [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], marked by [[juvenile delinquency]] and time spent in foster homes. Young Ruby sold [[horse-racing]] tip sheets and various other novelties, then acted as business agent for a local refuse collectors union that later became part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Ruby briefly came to public attention in December 1939 when he was implicated in the fatal shooting of the union's president, attorney Leon Cooke, but was cleared of any wrongdoing. In memory of Cooke, Ruby later adopted "Leon" as his middle name.

== Organized crime links ==
As a youngster, Ruby ran errands for [[Al Capone]]'s [[Mafia]] organization. During the 1940s, he frequented race tracks in Illinois and California. Ruby was drafted in 1943 and served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], working as an aircraft mechanic at bases in the US until 1946. Upon discharge, Ruby returned to Chicago. 

In 1947, Ruby moved to Dallas, where he and his brothers soon afterward shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for changing the family name had been that Jack and his brothers had opened up a mail order business and feared that some customers would refuse to do business with Jews. Jack later went on to manage various [[nightclub]]s, [[strip club]]s, and dancehalls. Among the strippers Ruby befriended was [[Candy Barr]]. 

He developed close ties to many Dallas police officers, who frequented his nightclubs where Ruby showered them with large quantities of liquor and other favors. Ruby went to [[Cuba]] in 1959 on one of his gun-running ventures and to visit a Mafia-connected friend, influential Dallas gambler [[Lewis McWillie]], whom [[Fidel Castro]] had briefly imprisoned. McWillie was also connected to leading mobsters [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Carlos Marcello]] and [[Santo Trafficante Jr]].

The Report issued by the House Select Committee on Assassinations said that Jack Ruby knew Sam and Joe Campisi since 1947, and had been seen with them on many occasions. In 1963, A PBS news report said that the 
Campisi Brothers were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. The Campisi Brothers were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/cron/]

A day before President Kennedy was murdered, Ruby went to Joe Campisi's restaurant.

== Public assassination ==
[[Image:Ruby-shooting-oswald.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald]]

Ruby (also known as "Sparky," reportedly because of his short temper) frequently carried a [[handgun]], and witnesses saw him with a handgun in the halls of the Dallas police headquarters on several occasions after President Kennedy's assassination and arrest of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] on [[November 22]], [[1963]]. In addition, it is known that Ruby impersonated a newspaper [[reporter]] and was at the police station on the night of November 22, though the reason he went there is unknown. 

The publicity-obsessed Ruby, who at the time owned the Carousel nightclub in Dallas, came to international attention when he shot and fatally wounded the 24-year-old Oswald on Sunday, [[November 24]], [[1963]], at 11:21 AM CST while authorities were preparing to transfer Oswald by car from police headquarters to a nearby jail. Millions of viewers saw the shooting on television. It marked the first live broadcast of a homicide in television history.

When Ruby was arrested immediately after the shooting, he told several witnesses that his killing of Oswald would show the world that "Jews have guts," that he helped the city of Dallas "redeem" itself in the eyes of the public, and that Oswald's death would spare [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] the ordeal of appearing at Oswald's trial. Later, however, he claimed he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so. The weapon used by Ruby was a snub-nosed [[Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver|Colt Cobra .38]] with the serial number ''2744 LW''.

The route that Ruby took to get into the basement of the Dallas police headquarters and prisoner holding area has been disputed. Some potential routes suggested that Ruby had to have received help from authorities inside the building, though many journalists entered the building that Sunday without having their credentials properly checked. Ruby stated he entered the jail via the entrance ramp, and a former Dallas police officer, [[Napoleon Daniels]], stated he saw Ruby use the ramp. Others dispute this claim, arguing that Ruby had in truth entered the basement from inside police headquarters itself. One friend of Ruby commented, revealingly: "He [Ruby] practically lived at the [police] station, and they [the police] lived at his place" (the Carousel Club).

== Motivation ==
Ruby's motives have been debated. Some believe that Ruby carried out [[Mafia]] orders with a "hit," because he was actually part of a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to assassinate the president. According to this theory, Ruby silenced Oswald to prevent Oswald from testifying at his upcoming trial. Suspicion was aroused by the fact that Ruby was able to freely enter a supposedly secure area, armed with a loaded, concealed revolver. Others have suggested that Ruby was an emotionally unstable, obsessive publicity-seeker who revered Kennedy and was seeking vengeance on his own. 

Shortly before Ruby's death from a [[pulmonary embolism]] (although by the fall of 1966 Ruby was also suffering from rapidly spreading [[lung cancer]], with which he believed he had been deliberately infected) on January 3, 1967, a friend insisted that Ruby tell the truth before he died. Ruby replied, "Listen, you know me well, and you know I'm a reasonable businessman. I wouldn't have done it if I did not have to do it." In spite of rambling comments that might be interpreted differently, Ruby to the end insisted that he had not been part of any assassination conspiracy. As his mental condition deteriorated, however, Ruby claimed that Jews were being slaughtered as part of a second [[Holocaust]] in the building where he was staying while awaiting a new trial.

== Prosecution and conviction ==
Prominent [[San Francisco]] defense attorney [[Melvin Belli]] agreed to represent Ruby free of charge. Some observers thought that the case could have been disposed of as a "murder without malice" charge (roughly equivalent to [[manslaughter]]), with a maximum prison sentence of five years. Ruby himself initially appeared not to be very concerned about the proceedings (which has led some researchers to believe that Ruby thought his [[Mafia]] associates would secretly help him win an acquittal or be given a reduced sentence{{Citation needed}}.) Instead, Belli attempted to prove that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family (the latter being true, as his mother had been committed to a mental hospital years before). On [[March 14]], [[1964]], Ruby was convicted of murder with malice, for which he received a death sentence.

Ruby repeatedly asked, orally and in writing, over the six months following the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]] to speak to the members of the [[Warren Commission]]. Only after Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the Warren Commission (and after her writing letters to the commission became publicly reported) did the commission agree to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], then-Representative [[Gerald R. Ford]] of [[Michigan]] and other commission members went to Dallas and met with Ruby. Ruby begged Warren several times to take him to [[Washington D.C.]], because he feared for his life and those of his family members, claiming among other things that "a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time." Warren refused Ruby's request. The record of Ruby's testimony shows Warren declaring that the Commission would have no way of providing protection to him, saying the Commission had no police powers. Researchers have wondered why Warren would not have ordered that Ruby be taken into federal custody and sequestered in Washington, D.C. (away from Ruby's perceived dangers).

Following Ruby's March 1964 conviction for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by [[Sam Houston Clinton]], appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. Ruby's lawyers argued that he could not have received a [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]] in the city of Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated that "everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come aboveboard to the world."[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/neal.mccarthy/jfkvideos.htm] 

Eventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby's lawyers for a new trial, and in November 1966 ruled that his motion for a [[change of venue]] before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and [[death sentence]] were overturned. Arrangements for a new trial in February 1967, in Wichita Falls, Texas, were under way, when, on [[December 9]], [[1966]], Ruby was admitted to [[Parkland Hospital]] in Dallas, apparently suffering from pneumonia. Ruby died of a [[pulmonary embolism]] at Parkland Hospital on [[January 3]], [[1967]]. Coincidentally, Parkland is also the hospital where President Kennedy was taken and Lee Harvey Oswald died. 

Ruby died while he was awaiting his new trial, which some believe, had he survived to appear, would have resulted in his sentence being commuted to time served, leaving him a free man. He is buried in the [[Westlawn Cemetery]] in [[Chicago]].

==Film portrayals==
Ruby's shooting of Oswald, and the mystery surrounding his behavior both before and after the Kennedy assassination, have been the topic of three films. 
====''Ruby and Oswald''====
A 1978 made-for-television movie, ''Ruby & Oswald'', generally supported the [[Warren Commission]] conclusions. 

====''Ruby''====
The 1992 feature film ''Ruby'', which speculated on Ruby's (played by [[Danny Aiello]]) more complex motivations. Among the impulses explored by the film that might have propelled Ruby into shooting Oswald were Ruby's reputation among family and friends as an assiduous, emotionally volatile publicity-seeker; the influence of his longtime organized crime and Dallas police connections; and the little-known fact that, over the years, Ruby had been an occasional FBI informant.

====''JFK''====
In [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', Ruby was portrayed by actor [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], brother of [[Bill Murray]]. Stone's perspective on events draws heavily from [[conspiracy theory]] researchers such as [[Jim Marrs]] and [[L. Fletcher Prouty]].

==Music Portrayals==
[[Camper Van Beethoven]] wrote a song called "Jack Ruby" on their album ''[[Key Lime Pie]].''

[[Deep Purple]] wrote a song called "Jack Ruby" on their album ''[[Abandon (album)|Abandon]].''

Billy Bragg made reference to Jack Ruby in his song "Wishing The Days Away" on the album "Talking With the Taxman About Poetry."

In Martin Scorsese 1978 musical documentary "The Last Waltz," members of The Band tell the story of visiting the Carousel and witnessing a fight; only years later did they find out the Carousel was Ruby's club.
