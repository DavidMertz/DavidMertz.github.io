In 1979 joined up with Childish, [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], [[Sexton Ming]], Rob Earl and [[Miriam Carney]] to found [[The Medway Poets]] poetry group. This was very successful in the region and beyond, performing at the Cambridge International Poetry Festival in 1981 and the subject of a TV South documentary the following year. In Lewis's dynamic performances, he "jumped on a chair, threw his arms wide (and to everyones amusement hit his head on the ceiling) and pretended he was Jesus."<ref name=milner79>Milner p.79</ref>

1978-82 he was the CSSD Porter at West Kent General Hospital, which provided subject matter for many of his poems at the time (since 1982 he has concentrated on creative work full-time, supported by his wife, occasionally taking temporary jobs such as cleaning floors in Tesco and tomato-picking). He knew [[Tracey Emin]] at this time and helped edit her short stories for her first book, ''Six Turkish Tales'' [[Hangman books]] 1987).<ref name=milner9>Milner p.9</ref>

In 1999 he was one of the founding members of the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art group along with Childish, Thomson and Ming.  Lewis has been featured prominently in all the key Stuckist shows, including ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'' held in 2004 at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] for the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. He has stressed sincerity in art: "People are never sure if we are being ironic or not. We are not. We are coming from the heart."[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:wx3Q5l4KNlsJ:www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/exh_gfx_en/ART24134.html+%22Bill+Lewis%22+artist&hl=en&gl=uk&ct=clnk&cd=39]
