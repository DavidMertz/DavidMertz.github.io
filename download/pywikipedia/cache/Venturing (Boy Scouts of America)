:''This term should not be confused with [[Venture Scouts]], which is the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] equivalent of Venturing, with the BSA's [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Venture]] program for older Boy Scouts, or with [[Venturer Scouts (Australia)|Venturer Scouts]], the Australian equivalent of Venturing.

'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is a division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] for young men and women ages 14&ndash;21.<ref>Venturer Application 28-303K: Venturers registered in a crew or ship prior to their 21st birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or they reach their 22nd birthday, whichever comes first.</ref>  Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.  It is based on a unique and dynamic relationship between youth, adult leaders, and organizations in their communities.  [[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouts]] are the nautical oriented part of this division.  As of the end of 2004, the Venturing program was serving 280,584 Venturers with 65,504 crew level leaders in 21,135 crews.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/media/review/2004.html | title =Year in Review: 2004 | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =March 17 | accessyear =2006}}</ref>

==Ideals==

'''The Methods of Venturing''' are:
* '''Leadership''' All Venturers are given opportunities to learn and apply proven leadership skills. A Venturing Crew is led by elected crew officers. The [[Venturing Leadership Skills Course]] is designed for all Venturers and helps teach them in an active way to lead effectively. 
* '''Group Activities''' Venturing activities are interdependent group experiences in which success is dependent on the cooperation of all. Learning by "doing" in a group setting provides opportunities for developing new skills. 
* '''Adult Association''' The youth officers lead the crew. The officers and activity chairs work closely with adult Advisors and other adult leaders in a spirit of partnership. The adults serve in a "shadow" leader capacity. 
* '''Recognition''' Recognition comes through the Venturing advancement program and through the acknowledgement of a youth's competence and ability by peers and adults. 
*'''The Ideals''' Venturers are expected to know and live by the Venturing Oath and Code. They promise to be faithful in religious duties, treasure their American heritage, help others, and seek truth and fairness. 
* '''High Adventure''' Venturing's emphasis on high adventure helps provide team-building opportunities, new meaningful experiences, practical leadership application, and lifelong memories to young adults. 
* '''Teaching Others''' All of the Venturing awards require Venturers to teach what they have learned to others. When they teach others often, Venturers are better able to retain the skill or knowledge taught, they gain confidence in their ability to speak and relate to others, and they acquire skills that can benefit them for the rest of their lives as a hobby or occupation.


;The '''Venturing Oath'''
:''As a Venturer, I promise to do my duty to God and help strengthen America, to help others, and to seek truth, fairness, and adventure in our world.''
;The '''Venturing Code'''
:''As a Venturer, I believe that America's strength lies in our trust in God and in the courage, strength, and traditions of our people.  I will, therefore, be faithful in my religious duties and will maintain a personal sense of honor in my own life.  I will treasure my American heritage and will do all I can to preserve and enrich it.  I will recognize the dignity and worth of all humanity and will use fair play and goodwill in my daily life.  I will acquire the Venturing attitude that seeks truth in all things and adventure on the frontiers of our changing world.''
;The '''Venturing Sign'''
:A raised right hand with the palm open, upper arm held horizontally and the forearm vertically.  The right thumb is held slightly open, creating a "V."''
;The '''Venturing Hand Salute'''
:A full-hand salute, with the pointer touching the forehead or hat brim.''

==History==
Shortly after Boy Scouting was founded in the United States, its creators encountered a problem with older boys. Some grew bored with the program, usually around 14&ndash;15, while others didn't want to leave their troops after reaching the age of 18. To alleviate this problem, overtime a haphazard group of new programs were created for older boys, including the [[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouts]], [[Air Scouts]], [[Rover Scouts]], Senior Scouts and Explorer Scouts, among others. Around 1935, most of these were brought together under the overall Senior Scout Program Division.  In 1949, these programs were reworked into Explorers, which included Sea Explorers and Air Explorers. In 1959, these were further re-worked and condensed into a unified [[Exploring (Boy Scouts of America)|Exploring]] program with Sea Explorers as a relatively independent sub-group.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Michael R. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Falls/8826/ | title = A History of Senior Scouting Programs in the BSA | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = March 15 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>

In the 1950s and beyond, many Explorer posts chose to run career awareness programs. Some of these programs became affiliated with specific organizations, such as police, fire departments and hospitals. In the 1960s and further into the 70s, this became an important aspect of the overall Exploring program.  Even with the emphasis on more career-oriented posts, outdoor oriented posts still remained popular.  In 1971, after a two-year experimental phase with [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Camp Fire USA|Camp Fire Girls]], the Explorer program went co-ed. 

On [[July 30]], [[1996]], the [[ACLU]] issued a statement<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20041105163559/http://archive.aclu.org/news/n073096a.html | title = ACLU Says Government and Private Groups Operating Boy Scout Troops Are Discriminating | format = | work = | publisher = ACLU | accessdate = March 15 | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> charging that members of Explorer posts affiliated with public services had a significant advantage over non-members in finding employment with these services. Because the BSA prohibits its members from being openly [[homosexual]] or [[atheist]], these public services were discriminating against such people. On [[April 10]], [[1997]], the ACLU filed a lawsuit<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20041105021807/http://archive.aclu.org/news/n041097a.html | title = ACLU Challenges Chicago Scouting Programs That Require Belief in God | format = | work = | publisher = ACLU | accessdate = March 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> against the City of [[Chicago]] for allowing these programs.  Most of these problematic units were career-awareness posts affiliated with government agencies, especially law enforcement and fire awareness posts.

In August 1998, the BSA moved all offending Explorer posts, and the Exploring program itself, to a subsidiary called [[Learning for Life]]. Participants in this program are not members of the BSA. All other Exploring posts were moved to the new Venturing program. This program was hastily designed (a change of this scale would take 7 to 10 years under normal circumstances) and as a result, there were many gaps and inconsistencies in the program guides. However, some of the new program (such as new awards) had already been in the works for several months. There has been some confusion between Venturing and the pre-existing [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Venture]] program. The awards system was incomplete. Many other details were noticeably less developed than their Exploring and Boy Scouting counterparts.  

Since that time, things have improved.  New and updated manuals have come out.  Additional awards (Quest and TRUST) have been added.  New leadership training programs for youth such as [[Venturing Leadership Skills Course]] and [[Kodiak (Boy Scouts of America)|Kodiak]]/Kodiak-X (formerly called Nature of Leadership) have been rolled out, as well as [[Powder Horn (Boy Scouts of America)|Powder Horn]] for adults.

Venturing, like Exploring, continued the tradition of having a national president of the organization.  Unlike other divisions, Venturing includes in its structure national and regional presidents.  The pre-1998 Exploring program elected its national president at the biannual National Exploring Leadership Conference.  The last president elected was [[Jon Fulkerson]] in 1998.  He was elected to serve as the national Exploring president and served in that capacity for a period of two weeks, until [[August 1]], [[1998]] at which time he became the first national Venturing president.  His first term of office was spent promoting the infant program and working on violence prevention programs that have been adopted by the Venturing division.  Currently, nominations are solicited for regional presidents, who are selected at the Annual National Meeting of the BSA in May by a subcommittee from the National Venturing Committee.  The president is now selected from the pool of the four region presidents of the previous term.  Many councils have council level Venturing youth cabinets (which may be called Venturing Officer Associations or Teen Leader Councils) who plan and carry out Venturing events at the council and district levels.  Many regional presidents are trying to promote the establishment of area-level Venturing presidents and events, but this effort is inconsistent from region to region.

==Organization==
The Venturing crew is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartering organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the crew, the chartered organization, and the BSA.  The crew may elect to be all-male, all-female or [[co-ed]].

The crew committee is a group of adults, led by the crew committee chair, who guide the crew program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration.    The crew is led by youths who are elected to the positions of president, one or more vice-presidents, secretary, and treasurer.  Other positions in the crew may exist, such as activity chair.  The adult advisor and associate advisors provide guidance while allowing the youth to lead the crew.

==Uniform==
There is no official uniform for Venturing crews.  Each crew may decide for themselves whether to have a uniform and if so, what that uniform should be.  The BSA Supply Division offers the spruce green button-up shirt for use by Venturing crews and the Venturing Division recommends that crews use charcoal grey activity pants or shorts as part of their uniform.  Crews may also determine different uniforms to be used for formal and activity situations.[http://www.scouting.org/venturing/support/index.html] The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Scouter dress uniform|Scouter dress uniform]] is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.

The term "Distinctive Dress Identity (DDI)" is no longer a part of the Venturing program, per se, but a modified version of this concept continues is that crews make their own decisions regarding uniform issues.

:''There is also a [[Gold Award]] in the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].''

A '''Bronze Award'''<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/bronze.html | title = Venturing Bronze Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = March 15  | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> may be earned for each category of arts and hobbies, outdoor, religious life, sea scouting and sports.  After earning at least one Bronze Award and meeting tenure, leadership, personal growth and other requirements the Venturer may earn the '''Gold Award'''<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/gold.html | title = Venturing Gold Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = March 15  | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.  To earn the '''Silver Award'''<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/silver.html | title = Venturing Silver Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = March 15  | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, the Venturer must earn the Gold Award, earn [[first aid]] and [[CPR]] certifications, show leadership and participate in [[ethics]] training.

Venturers may also earn expert awards that build on some areas of the Bronze Awards.  
These include the '''Venturing Ranger Award'''
<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/ranger.html | title = Venturing Ranger Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 20  | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> (Outdoors); 
the '''TRUST Award'''
<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/trust.html | title = Venturing Trust Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> (Religious Life); 
the '''Quest Award'''
<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/quest.html | title = Venturing Quest Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> (Sports); 
and the '''Sea Scouting Quartermaster Award'''
<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/quarter.html | title = Sea Scouting Quartermaster Award | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = April 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> (Sea Scout). 

In addition to these awards, there are others, such as the '''Venturing Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award'''<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/shooting.html | title = Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award | format =  | work =  | publisher =Boy Scouts of America  | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref> and the '''Venturing World Conservation Award'''.  Venturers may also earn other awards common to the Scouting program such as the [[William Temple Hornaday#Influence on Scouting|'''William T. Hornaday Award''']].  Venturers may also be recognized for their "excellent achievements and service to their community, state and nation" with the '''Young American Award'''. 
<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/awards/youngamerican/index.html| title = Young American Award | format =  | work =  | publisher =Boy Scouts of America  | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>

Male members under the age of 18 may also earn the Star, Life, and [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] ranks from the Boy Scouting program if they have earned at least First Class rank in a Boy Scout troop or Varsity Scout team.

===Leader recognition===
Venturing adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Venturing Leader's Training Award<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.usscouts.org/awards/scoutertraining3.html | title =Venturing Leader's Training Award | format = | work =U.S. Scouts Service Project | publisher = | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref> is available to any leader, while the Venturing Advisor's Key<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.usscouts.org/awards/scouterkey3.html | title =Venturing Advisor's Key | format = | work =U.S. Scouts Service Project | publisher = | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref> and Venturing Advisor Award of Merit<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/merit.html | title =Venturing Advisor Award of Merit | format = | work =U.S. Scouts Service Project | publisher = | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref> are only available to the Advisor.

===Venturing Leadership Award===
Both youth and adults are eligible for the Venturing Leadership Award<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/venturing/awards/leader.html | title =Venturing Leadership Award | format = | work = | publisher =Boy scouts of America | accessdate =March 30 | accessyear =2006 }}</ref>.  There are three levels of these awards: council (for those at the crew, district, and/or council levels), region (for those at the area or region levels) and National.  A limited number of these awards are presented on an annual basis to those involved in Venturing who have made exceptional contributions to Venturing at their particular level and who exemplify the Venturing Code.

==Program and activities==
Generally, each crew will select a specialty that determines the program and activities.  An outdoor focused crew will do a lot of camping, while a religious life crew will probably be involved in church activities and community service projects.  Crews are encouraged to have an annual Super Activity, which is typically a week-long event, usually during the summer.  Crews within a district, council or area may jointly perform activities that promote advancement through fun and competition.

The Venturing Safe Rides program provides a free and confidential safe ride home to any young adult who is not in a condition to drive safely, or who wants to avoid being a passenger in such a situation.

==Training== 
New leaders are encouraged to attend training for their position.  This training provides the essential information they need to provide a safe and successful quality program.

===Youth training===
Youth training in Venturing consists of a Crew Officer Briefing, conducted by the Crew Advisor.  There is a weekend training event called [[Venturing Leadership Skills Course]], which is conducted by the Crew or Council for all Venturers.  This can be followed by [[Kodiak (Boy Scouts of America)|Kodiak]] and Kodiak-X.

===Adult training===
Venturing Fast Start is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Venturing program.  Fast Start is self paced and provided as a video or online<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url =http://olc.scouting.org/ | title = Venturing Advisor Fast Start | format =  | work =BSA Online Learning Center  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = May 9 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.  Venturing Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and must be recertified per local council policy.

Basic Leader Training consists of New Leader Essentials and Venturing Leader Specific Training.  New Leader Essentials is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Boy Scouts of America.  Venturing Leader Specific Training gives the Advisor or Associate Advisor the needed knowledge and skills.  Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear.

[[Powder Horn (Boy Scouts of America)|Powder Horn]] is designed to introduce Venturing and Boy Scout leaders to the activities and resources necessary to operate a successful outdoor and high adventure program and is based on the Venturing Ranger program.  A followup course called [[Flintlock (Boy Scouts of America)|Flintlock]] is in development.

Supplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable (a monthly meeting of leaders), at University of Scouting programs offered by the local council and at National Scouting Conferences held at the [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] and the [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].

[[Wood Badge]] is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs.  Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months.  When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and [[woggle]].
