A number of my modules have been aggregated in the package found at:

	http://gnosis.cx/download/Gnosis_Utils-current.tar.gz

Rather than download individual modules and files, please fetch and install
(standard distutils installation) the collection.  Older versions of the
various modules have been retained in subdirectories of the Gnosis Software
download/ directory, in the unlikely case someone needs to fork an older
version.
