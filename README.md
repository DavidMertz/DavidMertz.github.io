Working on post-1990s look for my publication website.

A moderately modern look is the first goal; but the directories have acquired cruft in funny locations 
over the last 20+ years.  Perhaps we will clean that up.  However, maintaining **all** historically
published URLs for all articles and other resources will not be changed.
