Working on post-1990s look for my publication website.

A moderately modern look is the first goal; but the directories have acquired
cruft in funny locations over the last 20+ years.  Perhaps we will clean that
up.  However, maintaining **all** historically published URLs for all articles
and other resources will not be changed.
