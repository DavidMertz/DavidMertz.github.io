My loyal followers will remember my recent complaint to the Python Software
Foundation Directors and its Code of Conduct Working Group:

I have to say that while I might have been a bit peeved at the people involved
before, now I'm ONLY disappointed. It's like a clown car, and I have genuine
pity for my friends and colleagues who are still  riding inside of it. 

The below motion transparently disregards the laws governing US nonprofits;
more foolishness of this sort will quite likely lead to much worse consequence
than just me (and a few others) bitching a bit on social media (i.e. it's
violation of incorporation laws):

Legally, creating a "unitary executive" to replace the role of the Board
doesn't violate US law as such. Lots of nonprofits are run that way (albeit,
every time I hear about one is in the context of corruption indictments). Are
the Directors members of the Federalist Societyâ€½

However, such a large change in governance structure would legally require a
bylaws change, not a simple motion. I actually don't think this is a deliberate
power grab by the Executive Director. Rather, I think she is as oblivious to US
law as are the current Board. 

I didn't always agree with Van Lindberg on everything he did while Chair and
Director of the PSF; but at least he was and is a smart lawyer who generally
had more caution and nuance.
