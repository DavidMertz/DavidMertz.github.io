    Ruby on Rail is recent entry into the world of web application
    development that is rapidly gaining mindshare, even while in still
    in beta versions. Rails succeeds by automating creation of the most
    common types of web applications, while not straightjacketing if you
    want to add custom or atypical requirements. Moreover, compared to
    many Free Software libraries that perform individual aspect of a web
    application, Rails contains a nicely integrated set of tools for
    -all- the aspects of a common web application.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The first thing to understand about Rails is its Model/View/Controller
  (MVC) architecture. While this approach is not unique to Rails--nor
  even to web applications as opposed to other programs--Rails provides
  a very clear and focused MVC way of thinking.  If you stray from the
  MVC approach, Rails becomes far less useful than if you follow its
  paradigm.

Model

  The Model in a rails application is primarily the underlying database
  it uses.  In fact, in many ways, a Rails application is just a way to
  perform manipulations on the data in an RDBMS in a directed way.  One
  central component of Rails is the class 'ActiveRecord', which maps
  relational tables to Ruby objects--and thereby to the data manipulated
  by controllers and shown in views.  Rails applications are
  particularly likely to use the ubiquitous MySQL database, but bindings
  exist for a number of other RDBMS's.

  If you like, you can add Ruby code to perform extra validation within
  an application model, enforce data relationships, or trigger other
  actions. The Ruby files within an application's 'app/models/' directory
  can call a variety validation methods of 'ActiveRecord'.  However, you
  can also perfectly well leave the Model code as a stub, and rely only
  on the constraints of the RDBMS that holds the data.  For example, the
  application we develop below contains only this skeleton model code
  (at least initially):

      #------------------- app/models/contact.rb ----------------------#
      class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
      end

Controllers

  Controllers carry out your application logic in its abstract form.
  That is, the Ruby scripts in an application's 'app/controllers/'
  directory will load model data into variables, save it back, massage
  and manipulate it.  But controllers are not concerned with how the
  data is concretely presented and entered by users.

  In the general MVC paradigm, this can allow the user multiple styles
  of interaction with the same Controller--e.g. a native GUI, a web
  interface, and a blind-friendly speech interface might all interact
  with the same controller.  However, Rails is not quite so general as
  that, it instead is relatively narrowly focused on providing and
  collecting data within web pages.  Nonetheless, the layout of those
  web pages--colors, fonts, tables, style sheets, etc.--can be modified
  independently of controller code.

Views

  Rails Views are where we leave Ruby code as such altogether. Rails
  contains a very nice template language for '.rhtml' files, which
  combines pure HTML with embedded Ruby code. As well, the very surface
  appearance of a Rails application screen is generally controlled by
  CSS stylesheets. The '.rhtml' format is an enhancement of HTML.
  Actually, a simple HTML file by itself is also a valid RHTML template,
  but there is not much point in omitting the scripting control that
  RTHML gives you.

  RHTML is a true template format, not simply a way of embedding code in
  HTML, which is a much more powerful approach.  For those readers
  familiar with PHP, think of the contrast between PHP itself and Smarty
  templates.  That is, embedded scripting just intermixes code with
  uninterpreted HTML: the code portion is still responsible for issuing
  'print' statements when it wants to say something to the client.  In
  contrast, a template engine adds a custom set of tags to HTML that
  allow you to express conditions, loops, and other logic as part of the
  enhanced HTML markup.

CODE GENERATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The tools Rails gives you are basically a set of code generators.  I
  like this approach much better than a development environment that
  forces me to use a rigid workspace and IDE.  Rails does not get in
  your way, but nonetheless saves most of the work of manual
  programming--or at least eases you into the parts that require manual
  coding by providing first-pass scaffolding "for free."

  The notion of scaffolding, in fact, is a central notion in Rails.
  Very simple applications can almost entirely avoid custom coding by
  letting rails dynamically generate client HTML pages as it runs.  A
  first pass at code generation creates just the raw scaffoling; you can
  subsequently generate more specific controllers, views, and models
  that you wish to customoize.  But you need not generate much to get
  started.

  Rails relies on a fixed, and fairly commonsensical, organization of
  its files.  But this organization is relatively rigid; you will just
  fight with the Rails environment if you try to force other file and
  code organizations.  Then again, I cannot really see any reason not to
  go along with the organization Rails gives you; for the most part it
  "fits your brain" (as Ruby fans like to say).

A SIMPLE APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Several tutorials are available on the Ruby on Rails website that walk
  you through creating a simple Rails application (see Resources).  I
  will not do much differently from any of them; there is a certain
  right way to get started on a Rails application.  Given the relatively
  short length of this introduction, I will simply recommend one of
  those longer tutorials for more thorough examples.

  The application I will create is a basic address book.  My goals for
  the application are low, I just want to show readers the general steps
  involved in creating an application.

Generating the AddressBook Model

  The first thing we need to do for any application is create a database
  for its data to live in.  Technically, this step need not occur
  absolutely first; but it needs to occur early, and it feels
  conceptually clear to me to create the database before any application
  code (even automatically generated code).  So let us create a database
  in MySQL, and a first table within this database.  Consult other
  documentation for how to get MySQL--or another RDBMS--up and running.
  Here we just assume MySQL is installed and available.

      #------------- Creating a MySQL database and table --------------#
      [~/Sites]$ cat AddressBook.sql
      CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS AddressBook;
      USE AddressBook;
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
        id smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
        name varchar(30) NOT NULL default '',
        created_on timestamp(14) NOT NULL,
        updated_on timestamp(14) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id),
        UNIQUE KEY name_key (name)
      ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='List of Contacts';
      [~/Sites]$ cat AddressBook.sql | mysql

  There are a couple things to notice in this first table. Of central
  importance is that -every- table must have an 'id' column, with
  exactly that name. Rails uses the primary key column 'id' for various
  record keeping and referencing.  The fields 'created_on' and
  'updated_on' are not required, but if you do include them, Rails
  maintains them automatically "behind the scenes"; in most cases there
  is no harm in using these timestamps.  So the only "real" data we have
  yet added is a name for our address book contacts.

  Another little oddity exists with Rails use of singular and plural
  names for various things.  Various items are renamed between singular
  and plural versions, depending on their usage and context.  Table
  names should use the plural form.  I have not experimented with words
  having irregular plurals; e.g. 'datum' and 'data' might trip up Rails.

Generating the AddressBook Application

  Now that we have a database to interact with, let us create the
  'AddressBook' application.  The first step is simply running 'rails'
  to generate the basic directories and scaffold code:

      #------------ Generating basic code and directories -------------#
      [~/Sites]$ rails AddressBook
      create
      create  app/apis
      create  app/controllers
      create  app/helpers
      create  app/models
      create  app/views/layouts
      create  config/environments
      create  components
      [...]
      create  public/images
      create  public/javascripts
      create  public/stylesheets
      create  script
      [...]
      create  README
      create  script/generate
      create  script/server
      [...]

  I have abridged the output of running 'rails'.  All the omitted lines
  remind you of various files and directories that were created.  Try it
  on your system and browse through all the created files.  I display a
  few of the most important files and directories above.

Getting Rails Running

  Having created the 'AddressBook/' directory and needed children, we
  need to perform just some barest initial configuration.  First let us
  set the database by modifying a YAML configuration file:

      #------------------ Configure Database Access -------------------#
      [~/Sites]$ cd AddressBook
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ head -6 config/database.yml # after editing
      development:
        adapter: mysql
        database: AddressBook
        host: localhost
        username: some_user
        password: password_if_needed

  And finally, we need to serve the data.  Rails comes with its own
  single-function webserver 'WEBrick', which is perfectly good.  You may
  also follow instructions at the Ruby on Rails website to configure
  Apache or other servers to serve Rails applications via FCGI (or plain
  CGI, but plain CGI will be slow).

      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ ruby script/server -d
      => Rails application started on http://0.0.0.0:3000
      [2005-03-21 17:57:38] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
      [2005-03-21 17:57:38] INFO  ruby 1.8.2 (2004-12-25) [powerpc-darwin7.8.0]

Creating a Little Content

  The prior steps are enough to let you view a welcome splash page on
  the WEBrick port.  For example, on my local system, I can now view
  'http://gnosis-powerbook.local:3000/'.  But we need to generate just a
  bit more code to manipulate our custom database.  We do this with the
  script 'generate' that was created within our 'AddressBook/'
  application directory:

      #----- Code generation of scaffold model and controller ---------#
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ ruby script/generate model contact
            exists  app/models/
            exists  test/unit/
            exists  test/fixtures/
            create  app/models/contact.rb
            create  test/unit/contact_test.rb
            create  test/fixtures/contacts.yml
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ ruby script/generate controller contact
            exists  app/controllers/
            exists  app/helpers/
            create  app/views/contact
            exists  test/functional/
            create  app/controllers/contact_controller.rb
            create  test/functional/contact_controller_test.rb
            create  app/helpers/contact_helper.rb

  Notice here that we have gone back to the signular 'contact' rather
  than the plural 'contacts' in the corresponding table name. Now we
  need to edit just one more generated file, just a bit:

      #---------- Telling controller to use scaffold ------------------#
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ cat app/controllers/contact_controller.rb
      class ContactController < ApplicationController
        model :contact
        scaffold :contact
      end

  Now we can view and modify the content of our database at a URL like
  'http://rails.server/contact/' (e.g. in my test case
  'http://gnosis-powerbook.local:3000/contact/'). After entering a
  little data, it looks something like:

  {Pure scaffolding contacts list:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/rails-contact1.gif}

  {Pure scaffolding edit contact:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/rails-edit1.gif}

CREATING CUSTOMIZABLE CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The prior generated code creates a fully working interface to view and
  modify our database. But all the formatting, presentation, and
  business logic (such as there is) is done dynamically by Rails, and
  without any great sophistication. In order to get something a bit more
  custom, we need to generate just a bit more code. What we need now is
  for Rails to explicitly write out all the scaffolding it is implicitly
  generating on-the-fly, so that we can tinker with it.

      #-------- Code generation of explicit Controller and View -------#
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ ruby script/generate scaffold Contact
        dependency  model
            [...]
            create  app/views/contacts
            exists  test/functional/
            create  app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
            create  test/functional/contacts_controller_test.rb
            create  app/helpers/contacts_helper.rb
            create  app/views/layouts/contacts.rhtml
            create  public/stylesheets/scaffold.css
            create  app/views/contacts/list.rhtml
            create  app/views/contacts/show.rhtml
            create  app/views/contacts/new.rhtml
            create  app/views/contacts/edit.rhtml

  We have a bit more to work with. Notice that this code has gone back
  to the plural form 'contacts' (for reasons not clear to me, but we
  need to accept it). Let us modify a few things.  Maybe we can change a
  few colors and fonts in the CSS:

      #---------------- Configuring Cascading Style Sheets ------------#
      [~/Sites/AddressBook]$ head -8 public/stylesheets/scaffold.css
      body { background-color: #ffe; color: #338; }
      body, p, ol, ul, td {
        font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
        font-size:   13px;
      }
      td { border: 1px solid; }
      a { color: #eef; background-color: #446; }
      a:hover { color: #fff; background-color:#000; }

  Now that we have the code, what does 'contacts_controller.rb' do? It
  is more explicit and configurable in its action that the
  'contact_controller.rb' we saw above.  In part, the controller looks
  like:

      #----------- app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb -------------#
      class ContactsController < ApplicationController
        def list
          @contacts = Contact.find_all
        end
        def show
          @contact = Contact.find(@params['id'])
        end
        def create
          @contact = Contact.new(@params['contact'])
          if @contact.save
            flash['notice'] = 'Contact was successfully created.'
            redirect_to :action => 'list'
          else
            render_action 'new'
          end
        end

  As promised, a Controller's main job is to load data into variables.
  The object 'Contact' is the 'ActiveRecord' object-relational mapping
  the Model provides.  The variables '@contacts' or '@contact' are given
  data in their appropriate methods.  The methods are themselves
  referred to by URL's such as 'http://rails.server/contacts/show/2'
  (this one to show the contact with 'id' of 2).

  The controller above ultimately connects to views, RHTML files that
  make use of the data values loaded into variables by the controller.
  For example, here is part of the 'list' view:

      #----------------- app/views/contacts/list.rhtml ----------------#
      [...]
      <% for contact in @contacts %>
        <tr>
        <% for column in Contact.content_columns %>
          <td><%=h contact.send(column.name) %></td>
        <% end %>
          <td><%= link_to 'Show', :action => 'show', :id => contact.id %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Edit', :action => 'edit', :id => contact.id %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', :action => 'destroy', :id => contact.id %></td>
        </tr>
      <% end %>
      [...]

  The method 'ContactsController.list' loads the variable '@contacts',
  and the flow control tags in RHTML pull out the individual records
  from the array.

CHANGING THE MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our initial model contained only a name for a contact.  Unfortunately,
  given the length constraint of this article do not have room to expand
  the model to include actual contact data--phone numbers, addresses,
  emails, etc.  In general, that data would live in a child table, with
  a foreign key relation to the table 'contacts'.  The Rails model would
  indicate the relation with custom code something like:

      #---------------------- app\models\phone.rb ---------------------#
      class Phone < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :contact
      end

  But to wrap up this article, let us change our data model just
  slightly, and see how that affects our application.  First let's add a
  column:

      #----------------- Adding first_met date to model ---------------#
      $ cat add-contact-date.sql
      USE AddressBook;
      ALTER TABLE contacts ADD first_met date;
      $ cat add-contact-date.sql | mysql

  Now that we have changed the underlying model
  'http://rails.server/contact/' (the behind-the-scenes version of the
  scaffolding) simply adjusts with no effort on our part.  The
  controller and view are fully automated based on the model.  But the
  application version at 'http://rails.server/contacts/', with our hand
  tweaked files is not quite as automatic.

  The 'list' view automatically looks for -all- the columns, whatever
  they may be, by including 'Contact.content_columns' as part of the
  template loop.  But other views like 'edit' have already been
  generated, and we need to add our new data fields.  For example:

      #---------------- app/views/contacts/edit.rhtml -----------------#
      <h1>Editing contact</h1>
      <%= error_messages_for 'contact' %>
      <%= start_form_tag :action => 'update' %>
      <%= hidden_field 'contact', 'id' %>
      <p><label for="contact_name">Name</label><br/>
        <%= text_field 'contact', 'name'  %></p>
      <p><label for="first_met">Known Since</label><br/>
        <%= date_select "contact", "first_met", :use_month_numbers => false %></p>
      <input type="submit" value="Update" />
      <%= end_form_tag %>
      <%= link_to 'Show', :action => 'show', :id => @contact.id %> |
      <%= link_to 'Back', :action => 'list' %>

  So what does our hand tweaked application look like.  Not a lot
  different from the default, but you can see our modifications in
  action:

  {Hand tweaked contacts list:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/rails-contact2.gif}

  {Hand tweaked edit contact:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/rails-edit2.gif}


CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Rails is an extremely quick way to develop quite flexible web
  applications.  This introduction just barely touched on the style of
  working with Rails; but the full framework contains a considerable
  collection of useful classes and methods for carrying out the actions
  most used in web-based applications.

  Moreover, the best thing about Rails is perhaps the fact it gives you
  a whole "Rails way of thinking" with all the supporting code you need
  to use it.  This is a big plus over other toolkits and frameworks that
  give you only much more raw materials to work with (perhaps adequate,
  but not well focused).  Rails development gives you a clear path from
  a half-formed idea to a fully function web application.


RESOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The home page for Ruby on Rails is the place to get started:

    http://www.rubyonrails.com/

  On that site are a number of introductory tutorials and guides, along
  with downloadable source and documentation.  Unfortunately, while the
  guides are useful, the raw API and usage documentation is still less
  polished.  The documentation seems -correct-, it just does not feel
  very -inviting-.  I expect that will improve with time.

  One nice resource linked to on the Rails website is a ten minute video
  that shows real-time development of a working web application. While I
  am sure the video required quite careful scripting and practice to
  create, the fact it is -possible- to go from nothing to a working
  application in ten minutes is pretty impressive (the screen capture
  video shows the various code generation and editing in live action):

  architectural paradigm.
