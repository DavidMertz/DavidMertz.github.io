<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  My IBM columns, tutorials, and articles have had a dual--or
  maybe triple--purpose for your humble author.  In the first
  instance, I cherish the opportunity afforded me to share what
  knowledge I have with other programmers/developers, and maybe
  make a few people's tasks easier therein.  It is also awfully
  nice that I get paid money for writing these things.
</p>
<p>
  Another purpose is also contained in a number of my columns.  I
  have had the opportunity to release to the public domain
  programming code that I have written in the course of these
  columns.  In writing this code, I have had the goal of
  illustrating general programming concepts--and have tailored
  the code around that.  But at the same time, I have wanted to
  give the programming community code that individual developers
  can utilize directly for their own purposes.
</p>
<p>
  A result of releasing the code that I have, is that I have
  received back from users of these modules a number of valuable
  suggestions and enhancement patches.  Most of the improvements
  users have come up with are ones I would never have imagined on
  my own; and a few are almost shocking in their insightfulness.
  I'd like to use this column to present some uses of
  <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> and <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> that were not possible when I
  wrote the columns that initially discussed these modules:  <cite>XML
  Matters #1</cite> and <cite>XML Matters #2</cite>.
</p>
<h3>Enhancements To <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  One change, in particular, has been an ongoing struggle.  My
  timing was probably slightly unlucky.  Within a short time
  after I first created <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> and <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> (in
  August 2000), the PyXML distribution went through several
  incompatible versions; and not much later than that Python 2.0
  came out with its own not-quite-compatible XML support.  Users
  contributed several patches to match then current Python XML
  support along the way, but in their current state
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> and <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> both require Python 2.0+, and
  its included PyXML package.  Given the effective requirement
  for Python 2.0 in terms of the XML packages, I also allowed in
  a few other changes with Python 2 syntax.  The backwards
  incompatibility with Python 1.5 is unfortunate, but it would be
  too unweildy to maintain it in this case.
</p>
<p>
  One of the features of <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> introduced in <cite>XML
  Matters #2</cite> was the special <code>_XML</code> attribute that kept complete
  element contents (including subelement markup of character
  data).  The default behavior is still to create an <code>_XML</code>
  attribute of a nested object <em>only</em> when it contains
  character-level markup.  But you now have a choice about
  changing this behavior, using the function <code>keep_containers()</code>
  and the values <code>ALWAYS</code>, <code>MAYBE</code> and <code>NEVER</code>.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Default py_obj._XML attribute creation</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_str = <FONT COLOR=#115511>'''&lt;doc&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spam and eggs &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; tasty&lt;/p&gt;
...                   &lt;p&gt;The Spanish Inquisition&lt;/p&gt;
...                   &lt;foot&gt;Our weapon is fear&lt;/foot&gt;&lt;/doc&gt;'''</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'test.xml'</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=#115511>'w'</FONT>).write(xml_str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml_objectify <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> *

 <div class="code-sample"><h4>Changing py_obj._XML attribute creation</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; _=keep_containers(ALWAYS)

  Probably the most powerful feature of <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> is also a
  subtle one.  Many users have probably never needed, or even
  noticed class magic behavior.  What is possible, however, is to
  have special classes on hand that will determine the behaviors
  of "objectified" XML nodes.  The original article mentioned
  this, but it is worth seeing in action.
</p>
<p>
  Before the examples, a few details should be pointed out.  In
  order to avoid a sloppy conflict in the first module version,
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> now "mangles" the names of the class templates
  for XML nodes.  The "abstract" node class is called <code><cite>XO</cite></code>, and
  it has a few "magic" behaviors in itself.  When concrete node
  classes are created--by a programmer or dynamically--they have
  the form <code>_XO_tagname</code> (where <code>&lt;tagname&gt;</code> is a tag that occurs
  in the objectified XML document).
</p>
<p>
  The "magic" that <code><cite>XO</cite></code> itself provides are the <code>__getitem__()</code>
  and <code>__len__()</code> methods.  What these let you do is to treat
  each node attribute as if it was a list in those contexts where
  it would be nice for the attribute to behave like a list; but
  at the same time, we can refer to an "only child" node without
  having to subscript.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Node attributes as objects and lists of objects</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(py_obj.p), type(py_obj.foot)
&lt;type 'list'&gt; &lt;type 'instance'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print py_obj.p[1].PCDATA, '...', py_obj.foot.PCDATA
The Spanish Inquisition ... Our weapon is fear
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in py_obj.p: print line.PCDATA,
...
Spam and eggs  tasty The Spanish Inquisition
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in py_obj.foot: print line.PCDATA,
...
Our weapon is fear
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda line: len(line.PCDATA), py_obj.foot)
[18]
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda line: len(line.PCDATA), py_obj.p)
[20, 23]

</pre></div><p>
  Still more magic is possible if you want to create your very
  own node classes within a program.  Basically, you can make a
  attribute node behave in <em>any</em> way you might wish.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Creating magic node behaviors for py_obj's</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> xml_objectify
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_str = <FONT COLOR=#115511>'''&lt;buffet&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'buffet.xml'</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=#115511>'w'</FONT>).write(xml_str)

...             <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> food.PCDATA == <FONT COLOR=#115511>'Broccoli'</FONT>:
...                 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"If I liked Broccoli, I might have to eat it!"</FONT>
...         <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Yum!"</FONT>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_objectify._XO_plate = plate
&gt;&gt;&gt; py_obj = XML_Objectify(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'buffet.xml'</FONT>).make_instance()
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> py_obj.plate[1].eat()
If I liked Broccoli, I might have to eat it!
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> py_obj.plate[0].eat()
Yum!</PRE></div><p>
  Notice that the trick with the <code>xml_objectify._XO_plate</code>
  assignment is important.  To get the proper magic behavior, the
  right magic and mangled class needs to live in that namespace.
</p>
<p>
  In my opinion, it is fabulously cool to be able to grab a bunch
  of data from an XML file, then have a perfectly natural Python
  object act on that data as its own attributes, using its own
  methods
</p>
<p>
  For working with large XML documents, Costas Malamas has
  contributed an invaluable enhancement.  Until recently, the
  only way <em><code>xml_objectified</code></em> worked was to create a DOM tree,
  then recurse through that tree to generate the "Pythonic"
  objects.  That worked fine for small XML documents, but for
  around 50k-100k files, it starts to become absurdly slow.
  There appears to be a complexity order effect going on that
  renders <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> unusable for large documents.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, Malamas provided an alternative method for parsing
  an XML document, based on the Python <em><code>expat</code></em> bindings (<code>expat</code>
  is a high-performance XML library written in C).  While there
  are still a few wrinkles to be ironed out in the <code>ExpatFactory</code>
  class (failure for some documents with processing
  instructions), for most cases, the new technique provides
  speedy handling of even huge XML documents.  Using the expat
  technique imposes a couple limitations by design, also:  You
  obviously lose the the <code>_dom</code> attribute of your <code>xml_obj</code> (if
  you kept <code>xml_obj</code> in the first place); and you also do not
  have an <code>_XML</code> attribute to play with anymore.  The latter
  limitations might be lifted later, however.
</p>
<p>
  Choosing which parsing technique to use is straightforward:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Choosing a parsing method</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_obj = XML_Objectify('buffet.xml',EXPAT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_obj = XML_Objectify('buffet.xml',parser=DOM)

</pre></div><p>
  If no option is specified, the default is the legacy DOM
  technique.  But future code should specify explicitly, in case
  the default changes.  <code>EXPAT</code> and <code>DOM</code> are constants within
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> that simply contain matching string values.
</p>
<h3>Enhancements To <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  In analogy with <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, you will need to populate the
  <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> namespace when you want to retain the instance
  methods of unpickled objects.  That sounds confusing, but some
  code makes it simple:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Making sure unpickled Python objects are lively</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> xml_pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>class</B></FONT><A NAME="MyClass"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> MyClass</B></FONT></A>:
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="DoIt"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> DoIt</B></FONT></A>(self):
...         <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Done!"</FONT>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; o1 = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o1.attr1 = <FONT COLOR=#115511>'spam'</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_str = xml_pickle.XML_Pickler(o1).dumps()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2 = xml_pickle.XML_Pickler().loads(xml_str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2.DoIt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File <FONT COLOR=#115511>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</FONT>, line 1, <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> ?
AttributeError: <FONT COLOR=#115511>'MyClass'</FONT> instance has no attribute <FONT COLOR=#115511>'DoIt'</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; xml_pickle.MyClass = MyClass
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2 = xml_pickle.XML_Pickler().loads(xml_str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2.DoIt()
Done!</PRE></div><p>
  Basically, if you put the classes you want to pickle into the
  <code>xml_pickle</code> namespace before you start all the
  pickling/unpickling, you can restore all your object behavior.
  But notice that as with <em><code>pickle</code></em> and <em><code>cPickle</code></em>, the methods are
  not themselves pickled (just the attributes are); you use the
  class that is present at runtime for the methods (which might
  have been updates since last pickling).
</p>
<p>
  A limitation of <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> that was pointed out in the
  original article has been lifted by Joshua Macy (with some help
  from Joe Kraska)..  In early versions, <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> made no
  efforts to check for cyclical references in pickled objects.
  Furthermore--and for the same reason--every attribute was
  pickled as a deep copy of its actual Python object.  If you
  have a Python object with many substructures containing
  references to the same objects, the pickled size can get big
  quickly.  Moreover, unpickled objects will contain multiple
  objects that, while possibly equal (i.e.  <code>a == a</code>), are not
  identical (i.e. <code>a is a</code>) as were the pre-pickled originals.
</p>
<p>
  However, despite the gains in Macy's approach, it is desirable
  to introduce a DEEPCOPY option back into the module.  The main
  issue with the (quite elegant) <code>refid</code>/'id' scheme used is that
  it is likely to be much harder for a generic tool to utilize.
  Maybe users of languages other than Python want to be able to
  easily use <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em>'d objects (maybe more as hierarchical
  data stores than as full dynamic objects, but that is fine).
  Or maybe XSLT transformations of pickled objects would be
  useful for certain purposes.  A pickled excerpt shows the
  difficulty:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Pickled Python object as XML</h4><PRE>&lt;?xml version=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"1.0"</FONT>?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE PyObject SYSTEM <FONT COLOR=#115511>"PyObjects.dtd"</FONT>&gt;
&lt;PyObject <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>class</B></FONT>=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"XML_Pickler"</FONT> id=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"1383532"</FONT>&gt;
&lt;attr name=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"lst"</FONT> type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"list"</FONT> id=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"1391340"</FONT>&gt;
  &lt;item type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"numeric"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"1"</FONT> /&gt;
  &lt;item type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"numeric"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"3.5"</FONT> /&gt;
  &lt;item type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"numeric"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"2"</FONT> /&gt;
  &lt;item type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"numeric"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"(4+7j)"</FONT> /&gt;
&lt;/attr&gt;
&lt;attr name=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"lst2"</FONT> type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"ref"</FONT> refid=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"1391340"</FONT> /&gt;
&lt;attr name=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"num"</FONT> type=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"numeric"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=#115511>"37"</FONT> /&gt;
...
&lt;/PyObject&gt;</PRE></div><p>
  You can see that the attribute <code>lst2</code> would be a bit of work to
  figure out in a generic way (such as with developer eyeballs).
  One has to pull aff the <code>refid</code>, then search back for the
  corresponding <code>id</code>.  Actually, the use of the <code>type="ref"</code> XML
  attribute may have been badly chosen.  Given that it <em>has</em> a
  <code>refid</code> XML attribute, things might be made clearer by simply
  still recording <code>type="list"</code>, as with the <code>lst2</code> referent
  <code>lst</code>.  But of course, once something is done, it is harder to
  improve it without breaking backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
  A small caveat on references might appeal to subtle-minded
  hackers.  <code>id</code>/'refid' values are invented out of the Python
  <code>id()</code> of the relevant objects.  The values do not mean
  anything inherently, but have the nice property of being unique
  at any given moment of runtime.  <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> gives no
  assurance that pickling the "same" object in different runs
  will produce entirely identical XML files (the <code>id</code> values will
  almost certainly change).  In general, the ad hoc <code>id</code> values
  will not matter to a program, but if things like cryptographic
  hashes or CRCs are used as part of a process, this could be a
  gotcha.
</p>
<p>
  Not too much need be described about the enhancement, but in
  response to user requests, <em><code>Numeric</code></em> arrays have been added to
  the set of picklable types.  For scientific and mathematical
  Python users, these types may make up important attributes of
  their objects.  <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> makes an intelligent effort to
  make sure that <em><code>Numeric</code></em> is present when supporting it; if not,
  it falls back to the <em><code>array</code></em> module.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  One lesson I have learned in developing--or maybe just
  shepherding the development of--these modules is the the value
  of a Python truism:  First get it right, then make it fast!
</p>
<p>
  The latter part has now been fairly well reached.  Some
  optimizations to <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> have brought its behavior from
  O(N^2) to a manageable O(N), relative to pickled object size.
  The trick there is that <code>str = str + "more stuff"</code> can be
  shockingly inefficient if peformed often enough.  With the
  expat techniques, <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> is similarly swift.  I do not
  think I would have got something to the world quickly, nor
  received the amount of valuable contributions, had I worried
  too much about optimization early.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to learning more about the practical social
  dynamics of open source software development as I am able to
  create more tools and libraries like the ones discussed in this
  column.  It has been an interesting path, and I wonder where it
  will lead.
