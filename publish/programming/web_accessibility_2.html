<blockquote>    Tips on making your web pages and web sites disabled-
    accessible.  Part I gives a general introduction to
    disability issues, and discusses the structural markup at the
    heart of HTML.  Part II discusses specific HTML coding
    "gotchas" that make your pages unnecessarily difficult for
    vision and mobility limited people to use; part II also
    provides an overview of free tools to use in evaluating and
    improving the accessibility of your site.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">Introduction</strong></p>
 <p>  In the first part of these tips we made some general remarks on
  the abilities of disabled web users, and about the special
  technical means used to present web pages to such users.  Also
  in the first part, we introduced the idea that focussing on
  structural rather than visual markup alleviates many
  accessibility problems.  In this second installment we go on to
  discuss specific coding "gotchas" and present some tools that
  help in ensuring accessibility for web pages.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Specific Coding Techniques</strong></p>
 <p>  The top "gotcha" in making inaccessible web pages is probably
  the failure to use the ALT attribute in &lt;IMG&gt; tags.  The more
  important the information conveyed by a graphic, the more
  important it is to have ALT text associated with it.  Even if
  the graphic is merely decorative or conveys a type of
  information not reducible to verbal description, it is
  unnecessarily cumbersome for visually impaired users to wade
  through "unknown graphic" descriptions.  If the graphic is
  purely decorative, use an empty string in the ALT attribute,
  e.g.  <code>&lt;img="pic1.png" alt=""&gt;</code>.  If the visual information is
  complicated, at least let the user know some context.  A good
  guideline is to ask yourself "what would I say if I were
  reading this page over a telephone?"  For example, if it is a
  map of Cleveland, describe it as "Map of Cleveland"--sure the
  user won't see the individual streets, but at least the context
  is there.
</p>
<p>  Another "gotcha" is poor link descriptions.  "This" and "Click
  Here" really do not do much to describe a link.  Be considerate
  to all your users, not just to the disabled ones.
</p>
<p>  In general, you are best off using style sheets as much as
  possible, as long as they are accompanied by sensible
  structural markup.  Most tags give a pretty good description of
  what they are for; if you want to make them <em>look</em> a certain
  way, go ahead, but just make sure the are the right type of
  tag.
</p>
<p>  Another good guideline is to avoid relying too much on absolute
  positioning of tables, frames, etc.  If your information
  requires having a table <em>exactly</em> 420 pixels wide to make
  sense, it is probably going to fail to make sense to a lot of
  users, disabled or not.
</p>
<p>  And finally (for these tips), <strong>make sure</strong> you can do everything
  on your page with a keyboard.  Some users have difficulty
  operating a mouse, and the mouse should really only exist as an
  optional alternative to a keyboard.  Javascript for validation
  of forms is great, but don't use special tricks that make forms
  hard or impossible to operate without a mouse.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Testing Your Pages</strong></p>
 <p>  A good "pre-screen" of a web page is making sure that it
  contains valid HTML.  In many cases, popular general-purpose
  browsers will make allowances for improper HTML, and try to
  render <em>something</em> no matter what.  Although this is probably
  reasonable behavior for these browsers, special-purpose
  browsers are likely to be less sophisticated in inferring
  meaning from bad markup, and erronous inference is likely to
  create more difficulties for disabled users.  Many HTML
  authoring tools include syntax checking capabilities, which are
  usually of good quality.  A free alternative to commercial
  packages is to use <code>Weblint</code> for batch processing of syntax
  checking.
</p>
<p>  There are a couple good tools to help automate the improvement
  of HTML syntax problems.  Microsoft Office tools have a habit
  of producing particularly bad HTML--in terms of both
  syntax and accessibility.  The tool <code>demoroniser</code> helps correct
  some of MS' mistakes.  The tool <code>tidy</code> is generally useful in
  improving the well-formedness of HTML; <code>tidy</code> also includes
  options for reducing the size of HTML files and for
  improving them stylistically.
</p>
<p>  Once your pages have passed syntax checks, a good first
  practical test of your web site is to try using it on a browser
  with good support of HTML, but that lacks (by intention) a lot
  of GUI accouterments.  The homonymous browsers <code>lynx</code> and
  <code>links</code> are excellent places to start.  These browsers render
  almost all "good" HTML (including frames and form entry), but
  do it in text-mode, and mostly using keyboard input.  If you
  find your web site hard to work with using one of these
  browsers, chances are very good that disabled users will have
  trouble with your site; and the inverse is mostly true also (if
  nothing else, a screen reader can easily process a <code>lynx</code> or
  <code>links</code> text screen).
</p>
<p>  After you do your own testing using a text-mode browser, try
  running your pages through CAST's Bobby.  This free tool does a
  wonderful job of complaining about almost everything that might
  make your pages disabled-unfriendly.  Their online version will
  examine a specific URL, but you can download a Java version
  that will check a whole site.  A lot of the advice Bobby gives
  is just that:  advice.  It is still necessary to use your
  common sense in evaluating suggestions, and even a lot of
  Bobby's suggestions explicitly say as much.

 <p>  An excellent starting point for many accessibility issues is

  laws, guidelines, and downloadable software:

  web-sites:
