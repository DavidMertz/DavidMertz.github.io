<p><strong class="subhead">What Is Fte?</strong></p>
 <p>  FTE is a programmers' text editor with a few tricks up its
  sleeve that you won't find in most editors.  The main thing
  that distinguishes FTE is right in its name:  it <strong>folds</strong>.  If
  that does not mean anything to you, keep reading and we'll give
  you some examples and illustrations.  Other handy features FTE
  gives you are:  state-machine based syntax highlighting; custom
  modes for many languages (including HTML, Perl, Java, etc);
  configurable key-bindings (with nice CUA-style defaults); a
  number of subtle programming aids; and pretty much all the
  miscellaneous features a programmer expects to have handy in an
  editor.
</p>
<p>  Who is FTE for, exactly?  For me, the biggest "selling point"
  for FTE was that it runs on the three platforms I use most, and
  can share a configuration between them.  But I am fairly
  uncommon in using OS/2 most of the time; it is a lot easier to
  find a cross-platform editor if you use only Win32 and Linux
  (and if you use MacOS, BeOS, or other platforms, you have some
  porting work if you want to run FTE).  But even for
  two-platform compatibility, FTE occupies a middle ground
  without much else directly comparable.  FTE <strong>does</strong> a lot more
  than most shareware/freeware editors, even compared to those
  that target programmers.  On the other hand, FTE neither gives
  you all the power, nor requires all the effort and commitment
  of emacs or vi.  Most specifically, although it is quite
  configurable, FTE does not have any builtin scripting language
  the way emacs--or some high-end commercial editors--have.
</p>
<p>  On the negative side, although FTE has less arcana to it than
  vi or emacs, it still has more than I think it should.  To
  configure FTE, you have to mess around with text-based
  configuration files, rather than use friendly configuration
  screens like you would find in most commercial programmers'
  editors.  Also, like much free software the documentation tends
  too much towards "accurate, but not friendly."
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">A <strong>folding</strong> Text Editor</strong></p>
 <p>  If you haven't used an editor that does folding, you really
  just do not yet understand how useful it is.  The idea behind
  folding is that the text you are editing is often composed of
  conceptual blocks that you want to be reminded of, but don't
  necessarily want to have to scroll through.  For example, you
  might want to see all the methods of a class on screen at once,
  but not necessarily the whole implementation of each method
  (and if you did show the implementation, it wouldn't all fit on
  one screen).  But even more than programming code, one thing
  that benefits <strong>hugely</strong> from folding is HTML.  Here is an
  example, based on the FTE documentation:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;H2&gt;SaveFolds&lt;/H2&gt;  (0:10)
&lt;H2&gt;Colorizer&lt;/H2&gt;  [0]
    Specifies a previously declared &lt;A
    HREF="#colorizer"&gt;colorize&lt;/A&gt; mode to use for syntax
    highlighting in this editing mode.
&lt;H2&gt;Loading files in various formats&lt;/H2&gt;  (0:43)

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  The first and last line here are color-highlighted within FTE
  itself.  The parenthesis (also color-highlighted to stand out)
  after the folded lines tell you quickly that, e.g., the
  "SaveFolds" section has 10 lines in it, and is a top-level fold
  (it might contain sub-folds).  It takes just a couple
  keystrokes to fold away "Colorizer" and display the "SaveFolds"
  body.
</p>
<p>  If you happen to need to look at the same file in a different
  text editor, the folds are indicated by comments appropriate to
  the language being used, for example:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;H2&gt;Loading files in various formats&lt;/H2&gt; &lt;!--fold00--&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  It adds a few extra characters, but doesn't interfere with the
  actual function of the file outside of FTE.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Making Things Easy</strong></p>
 <p>  There are some nuggets buried in FTE that you might not even
  notice at first.  The modes are pretty obvious.  Most of them
  just set up syntax highlighting and indentation; but a few
  (like HTML) add some extra menus to insert templates (the HTML
  mode has most tags in the menu).  You can also make your own
  modes with a little bit of work (for a Python mode, download
  http://www.vex.net/parnassus/apyllo.py?i=55744778).  In no
  particular order, here are some more subtle nuggets:
</p>
<p>  - Support of ctags (see http://home.hiwaay.net/~darren/ctags/).
</p>
<blockquote>    This is a way of creating automated hypertext links between,
    for example, function calls and function definitions (even
    across files).
</blockquote><p>  - Highlights matching parenthesis when cursor is on a
</p>
<blockquote>    parenthesis (same with the various brackets and braces).
    Really handy to help see how nested expressions line up.
</blockquote><p>  - Hypertext list of "routines".  This is part of language
</p>
<blockquote>    definitions.  The idea is that you can open another screen
    that just shows a summary of the meaningful units of your
    text (function definitions, HTML headings, class
    declarations, etc).  Highlight one unit and press enter to
    jump there.  The concept is similar to folds, but operates
    independently of what's folded.
</blockquote><p>  - Bookmarks.  Lots of editors have this nowadays.  FTE is not
</p>
<blockquote>    left out on this.  They are named in FTE, rather than simply
    numbered.
</blockquote><p>  - Highlight all occurances of a word.  Handy, for example, to
</p>
<blockquote>    quickly see everywhere a call to function FooBar() is made in
    a file.
</blockquote><p>  - Lots of stuff you might expect:  block indenting,
</p>
<blockquote>    entab/detab, case changes on text block, sort lines, column
    marking/copying, call to external programs (such as
    compiling), regex searching, screen splitting.  A lot of this
    stuff is expected in a good editor, and nothing obvious is
    missing from FTE.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">Overall</strong></p>
 <p>  FTE does a nice job at a good number of things, and is
  especially a good choice for users who want a consistent editor
  across platforms.  A few rough edges make FTE more work to
  configure than it should be, but the learning curve on FTE is
  still comparatively mild.  You can get a lot of power and
  convenience--free of cost, and in an open-source spirit--by
  selecting FTE as your text editor.
