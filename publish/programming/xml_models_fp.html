  <h2>About This Series</h2>
  <p>  As XML has developed into a widely used data format, a number   of
  programming models have arisen for manipulating XML   documents.  Some
of   these models--or "paradigms"--have been   enshrined as standards, while
others  remain only informally   specified (but equally widely used nonetheless).
   In a general   way, the several models available for manipulating XML
  documents closely mirror the underlying approaches and   techniques that
programmers in different traditions bring to   the task of working with XML.
 It is worth noticing that   "models" are at a higher level of abstraction
than a particular   programming language; most of the models discussed in
this   series are associated with APIs that have been implemented in   multiple
programming languages. </p>
  <p>  In part, the richness of available XML programming models   simply
  allows programmers and projects to work in the ways that   are most comfortable
  and familiar to them.  In many ways, there   is overlap--at least in achievable
  outcomes--between all the   XML programming models.  However, different
models  also carry   with them specific pros and cons in the context of XML
  manipulation;  and these might urge the use of particular models   for
particular projects.   This series of five articles aims to   provide readers
with an overview of the costs, benefits, and   motivations for all of the
major approaches to programmatic   manipulation of XML documents (manipulation
here, should be   understood also to mean "using XML to drive or communicate
  other application  processes"). </p>
  <p>  The first article, Part 1, discussed the OOP-style Document   Object
  Model (DOM), which is a W3C Recommendation.  Part 2   discussed the Simple
  API for XML (SAX) and similar event-driven   and procedural styles of XML
  programming.  Part 3, covered   eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
  (XSLT) The final   installment, Part 5, will look briefly at a number of
 tools and   techniques that did not quite fit into the previous discussion,
    but that readers would do well to be aware of. </p>
  <p>  This article, Part 4, addresses functional programming (FP)   approaches
  to XML processing.  In contrast to the imperative   programming style of
 object-oriented and event-driven paradigms   discussed in earlier installments,
 FP approaches use a   declarative programming style.  XSLT, discussed in
Part 3 of   this serious, is also declarative; but the use of higher order
   functions and generalized computation is difficult and awkward   (but
not quite impossible) with XSLT.  General FP libraries   like HaXml allow
direct and powerful application of   higher-order functions, recursive computation,
 type-safe data   structures, and other FP techniques. </p>
  <h2>Functional Programming's Conceptual Framework</h2>
  <p>  There are a number of ways in which functional programming   languages
  are strikingly different from more common   <em>imperative</em> programming
  languages.  In the concrete, many   languages have aspects of each paradigm,
  but most languages can   be easily classified as either functional or imperative. 
    Imperative languages include C, Pascal, Fortran, C++, Java,   Cobol, Ada,
 Perl, TCL, REXX, JavaScript, Visual Basic, and many   others (object-orientation
  is just a variant on an imperative   style); functional (and "logical")
programming  languages   include Lisp, Scheme, Erlang, Clean, Mercury, ML,
OCaml, and   the one we will look at in this article, Haskell.  Several 
 "little languages"  that are widely used for special purposes   are also
functional--SQL is one  example, but of most interest   to us is XSLT. </p>
  <p>  Functional programming (FP) emphasizes the declaration of   functions,
  in a mathematical sense.  The last installment of   this series, on XSLT,
  used the analogy of linear equations to   illustrate the declarative style
  of XSLT.  This example applies   equally well to more general functional
 languages, but the   example might be extended with the ways one talks in
 higher   algebra, calculus, and the like.  That is, in FP as in   mathematics,
 a program consists of a set of named definitions   of functions. Every function
 is <em>stateless</em> , it says that given   certain arguments, a certain
 result occurs; that result is in   the nature of the function, it does not
 depend upon program   flow or the state of variables when it is called.
  </p>
  <p>  In particular, since functions in FP are stateless, their   declarations
  can occur in any order, not only according to the   "program order."  Moreover,
  everything in an FP program is a   definition of a function; there are
no   separate flow-control   structures like loops, branches and jumps. 
Yet another  thing   one goes without in "pure" functional languages is mutable
  variables--there  are not assignment statements, only   definitions.  Variables
exist, but they are simply place   holders for arguments that are referred
to in the result   definitions, not "buckets" that store and are emptied
of   values.  All of these features might seem strange to those   unaccustomed
to FP languages;  but many of those same readers   have been using SQL or
XSLT all along without  realizing they   operated under the same constraints.
  </p>
  <p>  The power of FP comes from several places.  It turns out that   all
  flow-control structures can be expressed in terms of   recursive definitions,
  so nothing is lost there (except a few   habits of thought).  But the real
  strength comes from two main   places:  1) the elimination of that large
 majority of   programming errors that result from misunderstanding of program
    state at a given point; 2) the use of higher-order functions.   The latter
 takes some particular explanation.  In FP's, it is   very common to define
 functions that take (collections of)   other functions as arguments and/or
 return functions as   results.  Rather than merely play with ordinary values
 like   strings, integers, floats, etc, FP's manufacture their own   functions
 to produce complex result mappings. </p>
  <p>  Some functional programming languages are also "lazy."  What   this
  means is that every data structure (including a function   definition itself)
  is evaluated only when, and as much as   needed.  In many cases, laziness
  saves work for the CPU running   a program; but this savings can be extended
  as far as defining   true <strong>infinite</strong> data structures (for
 example, a list of <em>all</em> the   prime numbers).  Infinite memory is
 not required, because only   those elements actually utilized are concretely
 computed at   runtime.  Haskell is a lazy language, as well as a pure  
functional  language.   </p>
  <p>  For further introduction to functional programming, look at the  
resources at bottom. </p>
  <h2>HaXml at Work  </h2>
  <p>  Let me describe a quite realistic scenario, that shows   weaknesses
  in the techniques described in the earlier   installments.  XSLT is typically
  the most direct way previously   examined to describe a transformation
of   an XML document into   an output.  For example, we might want to create
an  HTML   representation of an XML document.  Let us say we have an XML
  version  of the <cite>I Ching</cite> that looks something like: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>XML Version of the I Ching</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">

  </table>
  <p>  This XSLT seems simple and direct:  we just create a template to 
 describe how we would like each element formatted.  What could   be easier?
  The problem comes as soon as we want to filter or   compute something for
  the output--something that is not   included in the few comparisons available
  to XSLT.  For   example, maybe we want (in a numerological spirit) to display 
    only the even numbered hexagrams, or only the prime ones.  With   XSLT,
  we are out of luck for something this simple. </p>
  <p>  At this point, we might turn to DOM or SAX for the task.  This   will
  work, but we first have to simply throw away the work that   went into
earlier   XSLT transformations.  DOM or SAX are   completely different models,
and  share no significant code or   concepts with XSLT.  For something as
simple  as my toy   stylesheet, it hardly matters; but for large production-quality 
    transformations, we might lose a lot. </p>
  <p>  Moreover, neither SAX nor DOM have particularly elegant or   maintainable
  models for output.  In order to output the simple   (filtered) HTML table
  described, we just have to litter our   application code with <code>print</code>
     statements or <code>printf()</code>   functions (or whatever our general
  language uses).  These   output statements are themselves buried in conditional
  blocks   that test for element types and other conditions.  In such   code,
  there is no way to tell at a glance how the output flows   or make sure
that  a <code>print "&lt;/tr&gt;" </code> is reached to correspond   with
every    <code>print "&lt;tr&gt;" </code> that occurred earlier.  There is
  certainly  no guarantee given by imperative or OOP code that our   output
HTML or XML  will be well-formed (let alone valid). </p>
  <h3>A more uniform solution </h3>
  <p>  What would be ideal for XML transformations would be a system   that
  both let us express output declaratively (as XSLT does)   and lets us include
  arbitrary filters and computations (as the   implementation languages underlying
  DOM and SAX do).  While we   are at it, it couldn't hurt to be guaranteed
  the   well-formedness, or even validity, of our output.  And a   compact
 and direct syntax would be nice too. </p>
  <p>  HaXml gives us everything requested in the previous paragraph.   Actually,
  the power of HaXml is more general than was even   asked for.  Taking advantage
  of the higher order combinatorial   functions that a functional programming
  language like Haskell   allows, we can arbitrarily combine multiple filters
  in   specifying output.  In XSLT, each <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code>
   acts as a   sort of filter between the input and output.  But the only 
real    combination of filters created by an XSL file is a union on all  
the filters.   In contrast, HaXml lets us specify much more fine   grained 
chains of filters  for each element of the output.   Actually, much of the 
same can be achieved  using XPATH with   XSLT, but HaXml is much more concise,
 and strictly more    powerful. </p>
  <p>  As well providing numerous combinators, HaXml allows the   inclusion
  of arbitrary computations in the Haskell language as   part of the filtering.
   An extra bonus is that output can be   specified in a much more coherent
  block that allows readable   intermixing of output terms with filtering
conditions.   The   result is much more concise than XSLT, and has fewer
  punctuation  symbols to make visual scanning difficult: </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  As with XSLT, definitions may occur in any order.  The first   twenty
  lines of the code specify the output format, with   some definitions broken
  out into supporting functions, simply   for readability.  In Haskell syntax,
  a function is whatever   thing occurs to the left of an equal sign, and
the  definition   is to the right of the equal sign.  The <code>where</code>
  and    <code>let</code>   clauses specify what we might call "inner functions"
  in other   languages.  The first lines are conceptually very much like
the     XSLT approach.  But as an improvement, the HaXml version lets   us
define   ad hoc filters at each point where we need it.  For   example, one
filter   is: </p>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0" align="Center">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>rows `o` children `with` tag "hexagram"<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  The <code>`o`</code> is somewhat fancifully called "Irish Composition", 
    and can also be pronounced "of".  <code>rows</code> is our very own filter 
    that we have defined out of convenience; we are just as free to   reuse
    <code>rows</code> as to use any of the standard filters, and in   unlimited
  combination. </p>
  <p>  The latter half of the program contains a few computational   functions.
   One nice example is a six line primality test that   does a lot to illustrate
  the power and elegance of Haskell as a   language.  But as the program
is   structured, the function   <code>condition</code> could equally well
perform   any tests it wanted on   the Content of the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>
,    <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;judgement&gt;</code>   elements.
  "Content" is a special data type, so the first thing   we need to do is
  <code>unwrap</code> the String contained in a Content.   After that, we
can convert it to an Integer, and test it (or do   whatever else we want
with it). </p>
  <p>  There are a lot more details to the HaXml library--and learning  
Haskell itself requires a learning curve for programmers   accustomed to
imperative and OOP styles of programming.  But if   one limits one's interest
to just the capabilities one would   find in XSLT, the top half of the example
program is quite easy   to expand upon (I would argue, with less of a learning
curve   than XSLT, while using a similar functional style).  Not only   is
the syntax more readable than XSLT, but one holds in reserve   learning how
to do the sort of thing in the bottom half of the   program (and much more). 
    </p>
  <h3>Enforcing Validity</h3>
  <p>  In the above example, an XML document was treated as a generic   tree
  structure.  For most purposes, doing this is the easiest   and quickest
approach.   But HaXml provides something else that   is rare.  If one has
a DTD for a document type one plans to   work with, a set of native Haskell
data structures  can be   generated from a DTD.  From that point forward,
applications   can  be written that utilize the native DTD in their   manipulations.
 The generation  mentioned involves several   steps.  The first thing is
to <em> create</em>   the data structure as a   module, something like: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>Create a HaXml data structure from a DTD</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0" align="Center">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>% DtdToHaskell MyFile.DTD MyFileDTD.hs<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  Once that is available, one can write an application that   handles
  XML documents that must conform to the DTD.  Such   applications will generally
  contain at least the following   lines: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>Custom HaXml app for MyFile.DTD XML documents</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>import Xml2Haskell (readXml)<br>import MyFileDTD<br>[...]<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  From there, one can use all the higher order techniques Haskell  
provides for dealing with recursive data structures.  The first   thing,
naturally, will probably be to <code>readXml</code> in order to   work with
a particular input XML document. </p>
  <p>  A reader can be forgiven for thinking at this point, "so what?"  
It would appear that this is no different from a DOM   approach--or even
SAX--where one can perfectly well work with   structured data, or even validate
against a DTD. </p>
  <p>  There is much more here than meets the eye.  Haskell, unlike   almost
  all other programming languages, is <em>thoroughly</em> type   safe about
  data structures.  It is quite simply <em>impossible</em> in   Haskell to
 perform any computation on the generated data   structure that would result
 in an invalid XML document.  In   contrast, the best one can do in languages
 like C/C++, Java,   Perl, Smalltalk, Python is do a sanity check (validation)
 on   the way in, and another one on the way out, and hope everything   goes
 well.  It might be possible in something like Eiffel to   add enough contractual
  constraints on every "adder" and   "deleter" to make sure DTD validity
is   maintained (or, with   enough work, in all the mentioned languages),
but  doing so   involves custom programming within every <code>.addSpamTag()</code>
      method.  Moreover, all the DTD can do in the mentioned   languages
is  provide a "cheat sheet" for an application   programmer to look at. </p>
  <p>  With HaXml, the data structure generated programmatically from   a
  DTD automatically includes every validity constraint.  Mind   you, just
enforcing  the constraints doesn't make an application   programmer write
correct code;  but at least any bad code that   would result in invalid documents
is caught  at compile time.   The other caveat, of course, is that programming
a custom    application that enforces validity is just plain going to be
  more work  than programming one that does not need to do this.   But for
"mission critical"  requirements, HaXml could well   provide the quickest
and safest path to the rigorous goal. </p>
  <h2>The Good and the Bad of FP for XML  </h2>
  <p>  For the most part, I think that functional programming offers   many
  benefits and few disadvantages for XML manipulation.  Of   course, the
first   disadvantage one must acknowledge is that   most programmers already
know   imperative languages, while   learning FP languages is extra work.
 But I  do not think that   consideration should be weighed too heavily for
long-term     projects that will be maintained and modified over time.  
Allowing better   code is worth the extra learning curve for   individual
programmers (who  can be more efficient after the   learning stage). </p>
  <p>  One real disadvantage to understand with HaXml is that it is   basically
  DOM-like in memory usage.  Even though Haskell allows   lazy IO, HaXml
does   not take advantage of it, but rather--like   DOM--reads an entire
XML document   into a memory image.   However, the HXML library mentioned
in the Resources   is   intended as a superset of HaXml functionality, and
adds the   SAX-like   lazy data structure <code>XMLEvent</code> and functions
  <code>parseInstance</code>     and <code>buildTree</code> (the latter function
can be   replaced with  a more event-driven style).  One loses some of  
the elegance of Haskell data structures by moving to an   event-driven style;
but FP is not inherently   contradictory to   memory-frugal techniques (laziness
encourages it in some   ways). </p>
  <p>  The final disadvantage that I think is worth mentioning is that  
each FP XML library is just that, but nothing more.  That is,   SAX and DOM
are general API's that have implementation is in   many programming languages.
   These API's are standards, not   merely someone's good idea about what
to  put in a library.  As   a consequence, each of the libraries pointed
to in  the   Resources will have different conventions and function names.
  They  will share many of the same advantages of HaXml that were   addressed
 in this article, but the particular API of using them   will have little
in common.  Moreover, this situation is   extremely unlikely to change with
time; functional programming   languages have arisen, largely in academia,
each to express a   special collection of features and techniques.  A library
in   one functional language will not make much sense in another FP   language,
 even at a conceptual level (for example, if you   assume laziness, a non-lazy/strict
 implementation might be   extremely inefficient; or vice-versa).  All the
 OOP languages,   in contrast, are much closer to one another. </p>

            <p>  HXML is a Haskell XML parser that is largely compatible 
 with--but an enhancement of--the older HaXml library.  The main   improvement
  by HXML is an improvement in the space behavior   compared to HaXml.  For
  very large XML documents, HXML is   likely to be practical where HaXml
is   not: </p>

              <p>  A detailed discussion of HaXml was written by its original 
    authors, Malcolm Wallace and Colin Runciman.  <cite>Haskell and XML: 
 Generic Combinators or Type-Based Translation</cite> may be found at   the
 below URL.  Its tone and level presume a greater   familiarity with Haskell
 and functional programming than is   requisite for this column, but Wallace
 and Runciman's paper   thereby contains many details not addressed herein:

                          <p>  It turns out that from a computer-science
perspective, XSLT is   a "complete" programming language.  Dimitre Novatchev
   (dnovatchev@yahoo.com) has written an as-yet-unpublished   article that
I recently reviewed which shows that some fully   general functional programming
techniques can be implemented   in XSLT using a "hack" on namespaces in XSLT.
