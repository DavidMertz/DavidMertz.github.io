    What most programmers probably think of when they talk about
    "Python" is the specific implementation sometimes called
    "CPython" (because it is implemented in C).  However, Python
    as a language specification has been implemented several
    times.  One such implementation is "JPython" which is written
    in Java, which compiles Python source code to Java bytecodes,
    and which provides transparent access to Java classes.  A
    planned implementation is Python for .NET, Microsoft's
    forthcoming cross-language technology platform.  This article
    consists of annotated interviews with the developers of
    JPython and Python for .NET.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  In my previous interviews with John Max Skaller and Christian
  Tismer, I presented readers with some information--and
  hopefully insight--into Vyper and Stackless Python.  I also
  made some general remarks in that column about language
  implementations, and the theoretical and historical reasons for
  them.  I recommend readers glance at those comments, but in the
  interest of presenting as much as possible of my conversations
  with the developers of JPython and Python for .NET, I do not
  wish to repeat those comment here.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, let's jump into the interviews with Mark Hammond, Finn
  Bock, and Barry Warsaw.  They are all fascinating developers
  with a lot to say that will interest Python programmers.  I
  thank them for their participation in these interviews.
</p>
<h3>Python For .net</h3>
 <p>
  Mark Hammond is a developer most Python programmers who use
  Windows will know something about.  Mark created, and
  generously made available to the Python community, the
  excellent PythonWin development environment and PythonCOM
  extensions.  Given this background, Mark was a logical contact
  for Microsoft to turn to in their desire to make Python
  available for their future .NET platform.
</p>
<p>
  I must confess that I have not typically understood the real
  meat behind many of Microsoft stategic announcements.  Mark's
  interview helps clarify this (inasmuch as he is able), but a
  few details he was not able to discuss because of NDA
  restrictions.  One thing I found very useful was some comments
  made by developers of the Mercury language, which is also being
  ported to .NET (see Resources).  The Mercury folks may have
  been under looser NDA agreements than Mark was, and they may or
  may not have had a similar agreement as that involved in Python
  for .NET.  Make your own guesses.  In any case, this is nice
  background also on .NET in general.
</p>
<p>
  But let us look at what Mark Hammond has to say.  He indicated
  that a working version of Python for .NET should be available
  RSN (it did not seem to be as of writing).  Hopefully, by the
  time this interview is published, some betas/alphas will be
  available from the ActiveState link in the Resources section.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Exactly what is Python for .NET?  I guess I am
    especially curious how Python for .NET relates to your own
    PythonWin and PythonCOM extensions to CPython that seem to
    already give you control of Windows' guts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Python for .NET is a compiler and runtime that
    implements Python on the Microsoft .NET platform.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  The .NET platform provides a runtime and metadata
    system designed to allow complete language interoperability -
    however, to achieve that, the languages must work in that
    runtime.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  For example, if a Python class should be made
    public so a Visual Basic programmer can inherit from it, the
    Python class must be implemented and described in .NET terms,
    rather than in CPython terms.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  The advantage of Python .NET is simply that you
    can interoperate with the .NET framework.  There are numerous
    disadvantages, mainly due to the immaturity of the
    implementation, but these will be addressed over time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What, if any, significant incompatibilities exist
    between Python for .NET and CPython?  How easy am I likely to
    find moving application code between the two implementations?
    What are the major gotchas?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Most modules have not yet been implemented.
    Existing modules written in C can not be used.  If you are
    not targetting the .NET framework, you would almost certainly
    not use Python .NET.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  One main advantage of Python for .NET is that it
    will allow easy inter-language communication, and
    multi-language application development.  Is this on target as
    a big selling point?  If so, can you give a hypothetical
    example for readers of why this is better than using
    Python+C+SWIG, for example?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Your example of Python+C+SWIG should be obvious <em>
    inter-language calling should not be that hard.  SWIG is a
    great product, and has taken writing Python C extensions from
    a black art to merely difficult :</em>)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Comparing .NET with COM and/or Corba would be
    more reasonable - COM and Corba both offer a solution where
    cross-language calling "just works", without any
    hand-crafting or compiling necessary.  .NET takes this one
    step further, buy offering cross-language inheritance and
    exception capabilities, for example.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  These advantages are very similar to what you
    would find with multiple language implementations under the
    JVM.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  If I understand things correctly, it seems like
    Python for .NET is most similar to JPython inasmuch as Python
    for .NET will "compile" your Python scripts to the format of
    an external VM.  Is garbage collection automated, as in JVMs?
    Do you have any early guesses about peformance of MS's future
    VM?  Also, will the .NET VM support some of the exotic
    features of Stackless and/or Vyper, like continuations,
    generators, coroutines, tail-recursion, lazy-evaluation?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Yes, in concept.  The terms of the Microsoft Beta
    agreement prevent me from talking about performance.  We will
    only be targetting features defined in the core Python
    language reference.  Garbage collection is inherent as in
    JPython and JVMs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  My column appears under a Linux category , so that
    might suggest something about my readership:  they might tend
    to be mistrustful of anything Microsoft has their hands in.
    So I have a few questions closer to the politics of Python
    for .NET.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What is Python for .NET's reason for being (other
    than because MS wants it for their own positioning, I
    suppose)?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  So people who choose the target .NET can do so
    using Python.  Microsoft involved Python and many other
    languages in the early days to ensure that their VM was
    indeed language agnostic.  Microsoft made a number of changes
    to their VM based on feedback from the various language
    implementors.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What is MS's financial relationship to Python for
    .NET?  Do you pay them?  Do they pay you?  Upfront?  In some
    sort of residuals?  What sort of license will Python for .NET
    carry?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  Microsoft entered a contract with myself and Greg
    Stein to build Python for .NET.  The terms of that contract
    remain confidential.  I am now employed by ActiveState Tools
    Corporation (who did the Perl for .NET implementation), and I
    expect they will enter a similar contract with Microsoft for
    the completion of the port.  The source code will carry a
    "(c) Microsoft" note, but be freely available.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Related to the license issue, but not reducible to
    it, I cannot help but worry that MS will attempt to use
    proprietary extensions and "enhancements" in a familiar
    "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy.  In other words, I
    have a certain fear that Python for .NET might not actually
    be very good for Python in the medium/long term.  How would
    you address such concerns if readers share them?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Hammond</code></em>:  If .NET becomes a significant force, then having
    a Python implementation that targets it can only help Python
    - much in the same way that Python is helped by having
    JPython available to target the JVM.
</blockquote>
<h3>Jpython</h3>
 <p>
  For JPython, I was fortunate enough to get some responses from
  both Barry Warsaw and Finn Bock.  Barry and Finn are currently
  the two most active developers working on JPython, but it is a
  real community effort.  It should be noted (as my interviewees
  do), that JPython was originally developed by Jim Hugunin, who
  is no longer able to be actively involved with maintaining it.
</p>
<p>
  Between Finn and Barry I received an absolute wealth of
  comments and responses.  Unfortunately, length constraints make
  it impossible to include everything in this column.  I have
  decided make available the full interview comments with Finn
  and Barry at the link in the Resources section.  In addition, I
  will place Christian Tismer's full comments there, which were
  cut somewhat.  In particular, all of these interviewees had
  some interesting remarks to make about the relation between the
  CPython, Stackless and JPython implementations, and whether
  insurmountable differences exist between them (and whether
  such differences matter).  Some of this material is a bit more
  technical, but feel free to read further at the link.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Exactly what is JPython?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  My standard marketing-speak reads:  "JPython is a
    100% Pure Java implementation of the Python programming
    language.  It allows users to compile Python source code to
    Java byte codes, and run the resulting bytecodes on any Java
    Virtual Machine.  It is a very seamless and smooth
    integration with Java:  from Python you have complete access
    to all Java libraries, can build applets, can integrate with
    Java beans, and can subclass Java classes in Python and vice
    versa.  Like Python, and unlike Java, JPython can also be
    used interactively:  just type some JPython code at the
    prompt and see the results immediately."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  In simple terms, it allows the Java programmer to
    script any Java code she wants.  This translates to a 2-10
    times fewer lines of code in JPython than in Java.  Because
    Python is a dynamically typed language, you can develop
    applications much faster, with many fewer bugs, and end up
    with a much more flexible program.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What were the reasons for developing JPython in the
    first place?  What was wrong with the original CPython that
    required another version?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  I should point out here that JPython was invented
    by Jim Hugunin, who is now working for Xerox PARC's Aspect
    Oriented Programming project.  Knowing Jim, I think his
    primary reason for creating JPython was the pure challenge.
    At the time, many people in the Python world just didn't
    think it could be done; Guido himself was one of the
    skeptics.  Jim proved them wrong!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  So why continue to develop JPython now that the
    challenge has been met?  Because it's the most valuable Java
    tool that most Java programmers don't know about yet!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  JPython isn't a competitor to Java, it's the
    perfect complement to it.  Java is a statically typed,
    compiled language.  This ensures type-safety of libraries and
    faster execution speeds.  Although it is bytecode
    interpreted, most people view Java through the traditional
    write-compile-run-edit programming cycle.  Of course, Java
    leverages a huge segment of the software world, so there are
    a lot of resources available to the Java programmer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  But the same static typing and traditional
    programming cycle are what increases the cost of Java
    application development in terms of human resources.  And
    here, Python absolutely excels.  Because Python is such a
    simple and small language, it's very easily to learn (many
    experienced programmers can learn enough Python to be
    productive in about a day).  And Python was designed with the
    observation that code is read many times more than it is
    written, so Python source code is easy to share in a large
    team project.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  More importantly, Python is a very high-level
    dynamically typed language.  What this translates to is the
    savings in amount of code needed to perform a task, as I
    alluded to above.  With Python, because I can write many
    fewer lines of code, I can write them faster and have fewer
    bugs.  This is wonderful for rapid application development.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  Python also provides an interactive interpreter.
    This means that you can sit at the interpreter prompt, import
    Java code, create Java class instances, make method calls,
    etc., all interactively.  This is a wonderful tool for
    training programmers on the use of corporate Java libraries,
    or for experimenting with new Java APIs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  You also asked what's wrong with the original
    CPython?  Well, nothing!  IMO, all programmers should have
    both CPython and JPython in their arsenals :).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What strengths or advantages does JPython have over
    CPython?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  JPython gives complete access to its underlaying
    implementation language.  In most (probably all) C-based
    script languages, a C function must be wrapped in a thin
    layer of code that serves to expose the C function to the
    script language.  Fine tools like SWIG exists to automate the
    creation of this wrapper code.  JPython requires no such
    wrapper.  All Java code ever written is directly available
    for use from JPython.  The integration goes both ways.
    Classes and instances defined in JPython can be passed to
    Java code as if they were ordinary Java classes and instances
    (which is exactly what they are).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  The embedding/extending API is very close to the way
    it is exposed to Python.  It makes access to JPython objects
    from within an application or module quite elegant.  This
    beauty comes in part from the fact that JPython and Java are
    both OO languages.  Jim took great advantage of this.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  What CPython lacks is access to the vast quantity
    of Java code out in the world.  If there are Java libraries
    you need to use, JPython is the answer.  Conversely of
    course, JPython doesn't have easy access to any existing C
    libraries out in the world.  Finn has done work integrating
    things like Tkinter and a posix module through JNI, but those
    will always be non-standard in JPython because we want to
    retain the 100% Pure Java certification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Similarly, what weaknesses or disadvantages does
    JPython have?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  JPython only gives access to Java code.  Not to any
    of the existing C modules.  So every Python module
    implemented in C must be re-implented in Java.  And CPython
    has quite a lot of modules.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  Also, there is almost no documentation to the
    embedding/extending API other than the source code.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Since JPython combines Java and Python, in a
    certain sense, what strength and advantages does JPython have
    over Java?  Likewise, weakness and disadvantages?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  I think these have been covered above.  I'll just
    briefly mention performance issues with JPython.  Since
    JPython implements Python's dynamic semantics, there is a
    fairly extensive run-time that comes with JPython.  This can
    have a performance impact on some applications.  Standard
    Java optimizations such as just-in-time compilers and Hotspot
    technology can mitigate those considerably (e.g. benchmarks 8
    months ago showed that with a JIT-enabled JVM, JPython 1.1
    could approach and sometimes surpass CPython 1.5.2 speeds).
    We'll be updating those benchmark results, and concentrating
    on performance issues after we roll out JPython's successor
    (more on that below).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  In analogy with CPython, you can always rewrite
    performance critical sections of your application in Java.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  How widely used do you think JPython is?  Are there
    particular industries or types of problems that are a
    particularly good match for JPython?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  I think it's becoming more and more widely used.
    The companies that are using it find that it's a technology
    critical to their success.  JPython is valuable to them for
    all kinds of tasks, from providing an approachable scripting
    environment to their end users to making it easy to create
    testing frameworks for their Java libraries and applications.
    JPython's biggest disadvantage at the moment is that it needs
    more publicity.  I hope this article will help in that
    department!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Do you feel JPython is an attempt to keep up with
    CPython?  Or are they coequal implementations?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  The fact is that JPython <em>is</em> trying to catch up.
    Almost all new features are added to CPython first.  (Well,
    JPython did have string method before CPython did).  JPython
    has a disadvantage here because CPython has 15 times as many
    core developers as JPython does.  But even so, a JPython
    version exists with almost all the new features in
    CPython2.0.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  They are equal.  But in the real world one is a
    little more equal that the other.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  I firmly believe that at the language level,
    JPython and CPython ought to be completely compatible.  Where
    this is impossible, Guido will decide whether the differences
    are implementation dependent, or whether one or the other
    implementations are "buggy".  I would eventually like to see
    CPython and JPython become coequal, with JPython pushing
    CPython development in certain directions as much as CPython
    pushes JPython.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  One current example of this is in Unicode support
    <em><code>i.e.  JPython is already all-unicode</code></em>.  Another example is
    the types/class dichotomy.  In CPython, you have built in
    types like strings, dictionaries, lists, and numbers.  You
    also have classes and instances.  The built in types can't be
    inherited from, and to add more confusion, an instance has
    both a type and a class.  It may be easier to fix this rift
    in JPython first because of its object-oriented
    implementation language.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What, if any, significant incompatibilities exist
    between JPython and CPython?  How easy am I likely to find
    moving application code between the two implementations?
    What are the major gotchas?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  There are numerous small differences in the way
    some things work.  These are outlined in the JPython
    documentation.  Again, some are classified as acceptable
    differences given the language definition, and some point out
    places where one or the other implementation ought to be
    fixed.  Most are quite minor.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  Some modules have/can not be implemented in JPython.
    Some modules can only be implemented as JNI modules and as
    such may not be useful in the deployment environment.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Bock</code></em>:  Tellingly enough, the problems I encountered when
    porting my own script and programs as well as IDLE, PySol and
    the PMW toolkit was <strong>not</strong> the random reclaiming of the
    garbage collection or the missing <cite>_del_</cite> method.  It was
    minor stuff that no one else had encounter before <em><code>i.e. in
    CPython behavior</code></em>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  The next version of JPython will be compatible
    with the Python 2.0 language definition, so the biggest
    gotchas will be in the libraries.  Any of the standard
    library modules from the CPython distribution that are
    written in pure Python should be portable.  C extension
    modules will not be, unless they are specifically integrated
    through a JNI bridge, or re-implemented in Java.  And any
    JPython application that extensively uses Java APIs will have
    a hard time porting back to CPython.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  On the other hand, there is a lot of common
    functionality in the libraries of the two systems.  With
    sufficient foresight, compatibility layers can be built into
    your application.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Any thoughts on future directions for JPython?
    Anything new and different expected down the pipeline?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  In order to ensure its continued existance and
    development, and in accordance with CNRI's JPython 1.1.x
    license, we have created JPython's successor, which we call
    "Jython", based on the public JPython 1.1 release.  We've
    moved the entire development process to SourceForge and will
    manage it using the same kind of open process that is working
    so well for CPython.  Finn and I are obviously intimately
    involved in Jython's future development, and Jython will be
    released with the CPython 2.0 license, which has been OSI
    approved.  This is as close to an "official" fork as you're
    going to get, so the current JPython community should be
    confident that Jython won't ever go away, and I hope they
    will eventually migrate over to Jython.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Warsaw</code></em>:  Right now the code should be considered in alpha
    phase, but Finn and I will be working on several technical
    milestones for the Jython 2.0 release.  Jython already
    contains Finn's errata, and CPython 2.0 features such as
    augmented assignments and extended print (with list
    comprehensions coming soon).  We've integrated the free
    Apache Jakarta OROMatcher code, thus eliminating the need for
    dual licensing, and we've fixed lots of bugs, with many more
    fixes coming.  I don't know when the first alpha release of
    Jython 2.0 will happen, but all the code is currently
    available in the SourceForge CVS tree.  Please visit
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jython">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jython</a> for more details.
