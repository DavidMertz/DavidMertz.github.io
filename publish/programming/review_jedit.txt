BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As is well known, developers--and my WR readers specifically--
  feel strongly about their text editors.  I frequently receive
  recommendations to review reader's favorites.  I was sent just
  such encouragement to try jEdit, which picqued my interest.
  jEdit is a text editor written in Java; so my first thought
  was to the rather negative overall experience I have had with
  Java applications.  Far more often than not--at least in my
  experience--Java applications fall far short of Sun's promise
  of "write once, run anywhere."  In fact, I rarely manage to
  get Java applications to meaningfully run at all, since I
  rarely have the precise same OS, JVM, libraries (and maybe
  karma) as the authors of the Java applications--which crash-
  and-burn variously otherwise.

  Against my background of suspicion, I found that jEdit runs
  without any problems, it runs fast-enough, and it has a very
  nice range of features and a good interface.  In fact, jEdit
  has a lot of quite cutting-edge and sophisticated features,
  many beyond other editors I have reviewed.  jEdit just might
  be the best text editor I have found yet if cross-platform
  support is a consideration.


WHAT IS JEDIT?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  jEdit is a GUI text editor written in Java and using the Swing
  graphics library (standard in Java2).  It is nice looking,
  powerful, extensible, and friendly.  It even has pretty decent
  online help.  A lot of the most powerful features of jEdit are
  aimed at Java programmers (which I am not), but the general
  base capabilities are rich enough that you don't need to worry
  about such extras.  Of course, if you *are* a Java programmer,
  you positively *must* try jEdit.

  Some users are probably worried that a Java-based editor will
  be too slow.  The truth is, Java applications are not as fast
  as native-compiled ones.  But on a reasonably modern machine,
  jEdit keeps up with any text editing you might do.  I wouldn't
  recommend Java-anything on an old 486 or slow Pentium, but my
  K6-II 333Mhz is easily more than adequate.


WHAT IT'S GOT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  jEdit does more than I can describe in a short review.  There
  is a lot that is "native" to jEdit, but even more is contained
  in "plugins."  Plugins are bits of extra functionality contained
  in auto-loaded Jar files.  jEdit makes locating, installing, and
  removing plugins almost completely effortless; once loaded a
  plugin can modify the basic behavior of the editor in a seamless
  way, or it can simply add an external function to the "Plugins"
  menu.  Since I accepted jEdit's installation option to search
  the internet for plugins, and install them automatically, I
  actually do not entirely know which capabilities are default
  and which are extensions.  The wonderful thing is, I don't
  *need* to know.

  Plugins do things like insert code templates, beautify your
  code to style guides, browse class hierarchies, convert a
  syntax-highlighted document to HTML, email a buffer, pick HTML
  colors, highlight code errors, display context-sensitive
  JavaDoc documentation, comment code, perform various text
  transforms, and many other things.  A lot of these capabilities
  are specific to Java-language code, but a lot are generic too.

  The "native" jEdit consists of a tabbed document window, some
  buttons, a menu bar, and a "jEdit command-line."  In 2.6 (beta
  at time of writing) advanced dialogs are generally dockable.
  The toolbar and menus are somewhat changed between the stable
  (2.5) and beta version (2.6), but in either the menus are
  clearly and intuitively arranged (2.6 is better).

  Even without plugins, jEdit has syntax-highlighting for an
  amazing number of languages, numerous powerful search/replace
  options (including regex), bookmarks (called "markers"), nicely
  configurable edit areas, a basic keystroke-macro system, good
  text selection (including column) and modification options (e.g.
  indenting, capitalization, and the like), multiple-clipboard
  items (and something similar called "registers").

  Even beyond the "basics" above, jEdit has two unusual, but
  very useful helpers.  You can "expand abbreviations" (optionally
  as you type), and you can "complete word" with a hotkey.  This
  latter gives you something much like the code-completion in an
  IDE like VB's.  From what I can tell, jEdit compiles a list of
  all the words beginning with an initial few letters in your
  text, and pops up a list of them on a hotkey press.  It saves
  typing and improves spelling.


WHAT IT AIN'T GOT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The main thing missing from jEdit is surprising, and quite
  disappointing for me.  jEdit has *absolutely* no concept of
  word-wrapping and paragraph formatting.  For typing paragraph
  text, you are sent back to typewriter days of watching margins
  and pressing hard returns.  I bet paragraph capabilities could
  all be handled with a good plugin, but none seems to exist
  right now.  Strange.

  The only other quibbles I could raise are minor.  Falling shy
  of my holy grail of editors, I miss folding capabilities (see
  my WR FTE review for an example).  And even though the help
  system is well written, it has no search capability, and only
  a so-so index.  Basically, the help system is some HTML pages
  that are rendered using a HTML Javabean (of so it looks).
  This is not terrible, but it could stand improvement.


ABOUT THE AUTHOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is hardly anything David Mertz feels more strongly about than
  text-editors. It stands to reason after a tally of the hours and
  minutes of his days. You can find out copious biographical details
