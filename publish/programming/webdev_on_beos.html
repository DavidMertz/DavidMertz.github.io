<blockquote>    When choosing a platform for web development, too many users
    overlook BeOS R5 as a choice.  BeOS provides just about
    everything a web developer could want, all in a friendly,
    pretty, fast and reliable, environment.  It has everything
    but market-penetration and mindshare that one could want in
    an operating system
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">Getting Beos</strong></p>
 <p>  On its intrinsic merits, BeOS R5 is probably the best desktop
  operating system you can find nowadays.  Of course, what OS you
  actually use will depend on many rather extrinsic factors:
  what your workplace uses; where existing software runs; numbers
  of available free or commercial applications; and plain old
  familiarity.  For many users, the possibility of working with
  operating systems where they can see and change the source code
  (and share the changes) is an extra benefit in itself.  But if
  you have the option to just work on the <em>best</em> platform
  possible--and web development, being largely platform
  independent is one place the option is likely--BeOS is a great
  platform to work on.
</p>
<p>  BeOS is a closed-source operating system for x86 and (pre-G3)
  PowerPC computers.  It was designed and built "from the ground
  up" rather than based on any existing kernels, and thereby was
  able to use many of the best ideas of OS design while
  forgetting accumulated cruft.  BeOS is pervasively
  multi-threaded, extremely snappy in performance,
  multi-processor enabled, and has a fully integrated GUI.  As
  well, BeOS uses a modern "database-like" filesystem with
  extended file attributes.  Almost everything you do on BeOS
  happens a bit faster than it does on other OS's (on the same
  hardware).  And R5 is as rock- solid and reliable as any OS I
  have worked with.  Much of the design focus of BeOS is for
  multimedia work, where smooth multitasking and high-performance
  are particularly important.  In many ways, BeOS is what MacOS X
  should have been (not just metaphorically, Apple was actually
  in negotiations with Be, Inc. in 1998; but they fell through in
  the end).
</p>
<p>  The interface to BeOS is Mac-like at first brush.  The BeOS
  Desktop works like an improved MacOS finder, with the
  accompanying Tracker something like an improved Windows Start
  bar (or like the WarpCenter in OS/2, or the taskbars in Gnome
  and KDE).  In most respects, BeOS improves on its various
  cousins, but I would wish for a bit more keyboard-friendliness
  than its mouse-oriented interface has (in much the same way as
  is true of MacOS, with which BeOS shares many keyboard
  shortcuts).  Like the Mac, BeOS works with a user, rather than
  fighting a user with arcana the way the free *nixes do.
</p>
<p>  However, along side its GUI, BeOS offers a Bash shell, complete
  with a majority of the command-line utilities Unix users have
  come to love.  To name just a few:  gcc2.9, less, gawk, du,
  sed, rm, mount, sort, ls, pwd, gzip, kill, strings, diff (and
  dozens of others).  Open a terminal, and you can just about
  convince yourself you are working in a *nix environment (if you
  ignore the pretty frame elements around the terminal window,
  and some directory differences).  As well, for application
  developers, BeOS comes bundled with a version of Metrowerks
  CodeWarrior for C/C++ (and inline assembly).
</p>
<p>  To get everything described, you can either download the Free
  Personal Edition, or buy the BeOS Pro 5 version for $50.  The
  free version performs an odd little trick of living inside a
  virtual partition (actually a big file) that must be launched
  from a Win32 platform.  For more flexible multi-booting, and
  just to get the most out of your system, I recommend using the
  Pro version beyond an initial "just-looking" installation of
  the free version.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Web Development</strong></p>
 <p>  Assuming you want to use BeOS as a platform for developing web
  sites, there are a number of tools you will probably want on
  hand.  Fortunately, a remarkable number of tools have been
  either written for or ported to BeOS.  On the other hand, most
  of the tools you are likely to use will be different ones from
  those you are familiar with on other platforms.  In the rest of
  this article, I take a look at some of the tools available
  under BeOS in several categories relevant to web development:
  web browsers, text editors and HTML editors, scripting
  languages (for CGI, or batch site processing), web servers, and
  miscellaneous utilities.  Given the breadth, the depth of
  discussion of each tool will be shallow.  But my remarks should
  help readers get a feel for available options.  One category
  not covered here is one where BeOS is strongest.  Given its
  multimedia focus, a quite rich range of image editing tools are
  available for BeOS.
</p>
<p>  The tools mentioned come under a number of different pricing
  and licensing schemes.  As a pattern, there seem to be a a lot
  more shareware and freeware (i.e. free-of-cost but
  closed-source) tools for BeOS than there are for free operating
  systems (e.g.  Linux or FreeBSD).  Unlike most Windows
  commercial programs, almost all programs for BeOS have
  downloadable trial versions available.  In some cases, the
  trial versions are extremely crippled, in others they are
  fairly usable (but encourage you to register eventually).  The
  situation is reminiscent of the old days of DOS and Win31, and
  also similar to the MacOS world today.  A big plus for BeOS
  tools is that they are uniformly easy to install, and do not
  cause conflicts once installed (both the pricey and free
  tools)--none of the "DLL hell" of Windows, and none of the
  makefile hair-pulling of many Linux/FreeBSD applications.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Web Browsers</strong></p>
 <p>  The first thing you need to do web development is a web browser
  to check your pages in.  BeOS has a pretty good range of
  options, but not the ones you are most familiar with on
  Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.
</p>
<p>  Out of the box, BeOS comes with a browser called NetPositive.
  This is a pretty good browser, with a fairly simple interface.
  NetPositive does not support some fairly standard bells-and-
  whistles like JavaScript, however (Java can be enabled,
  however), so it doesn't work for everything.  But the rendering
  of HTML itself is good (and quick).
</p>
<p>  To get a full featured graphical browser, you basically have
  two choices.  The commercial Opera browser is an awfully good
  browser, with quite a few whiz-bang features for a large number
  of platforms.  Opera does some of the most consistent rendering
  of any browser with maybe the best CSS support.  Then again, it
  seems a bit hard to sell a $40 browser when IE, Netscape, and
  Konqueror are free for their supported platforms.
</p>
<p>  The other full-features choice for BeOS is BeZilla, the BeOS
  port of Mozilla.  While I have had pretty good luck with recent
  builds of Mozilla on some other platforms (mostly Warpzilla),
  the binary BeOS port available as of this writing was not the
  most recent release, and had stability problems.  Most likely,
  as some newer Mozilla candidates are ported, things will
  improve (and BeZilla will even become standard).
</p>
<p>  Beyond the graphical browsers, BeOS has ports of the full range
  of text-mode browsers, which appeal to a niche of users
  (including, at times, this writer):  Lynx, Links, W3M. All of
  these are good to have on hand, mostly as sanity checks on the
  accessibility of websites.
</p>
<p>  It is worth noting that the Flash and RealPlayer plugins are
  available for the graphical browsers, and Java support can also
  be enabled.  Other more specialized plugins are likely to pose
  a problem (but the native support for media formats is quite
  good, so you might be in luck).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Editors</strong></p>
 <p>  After being able to view web pages, the next most important
  thing for a web developer is probably a text/HTML editor in
  which to create web pages--and also things like CGI scripts or
  Java programs that will be used in connection with web pages.
  BeOS does pretty well here also, even pretty well for free.
</p>
<p>  Out-of-the-box, BeOS comes with StyledEdit and BeIDE.  The
  first is a lot like the built-in SimpleEdit under MacOS or
  WordPad under Windows.  BeIDE is a bit more advanced--it is
  actually the Metrowerks C/C++ development environment.  But the
  editor can be used for other file types (without most
  type-specific aids), and does a bit more than StyledEdit.
</p>
<p>  Still, you probably want to download a fancier editor if you
  are doing web development.  The big monsters of the Unix
  world--'vi' and <code>emacs</code> both have one or more BeOS ports (<code>vi</code>
  has both <code>vim</code> and <code>elvis</code>, for example).  You can also get
  some other Linux-land editors like <code>joe</code> if you want.  But if
  you want to go in a more BeOS-oriented direction, you have a
  number of choices also.
</p>
<p>  <em>Eddie</em> is a nice freeware programmers editor with most of the
  enhancements you expect in a programmers editors.  You get
  syntax highlighting for a lot of languages (including HTML) and
  regular expression searches.  Some of the enhancements are
  directed at C/C++ rather than other languages, but a lot are
  general.  <em>HotEdit</em> is another popular freeware text editor,
  this one with the most enhancements directed to HTML.
</p>
<p>  <em>PE</em> is a genuinely full-featured text editor.  Lots of
  languages are recognized; and enhancments like code insertion,
  function jumps, syntax highlighting, multifile regular
  expression searching, and other powerful editor features are
  incorporated.  HTML is quite well supported by a template
  insertion button bar.  Unfortunately, you have to pay $50 for
  <em>PE</em>, and it is very badly crippled in the demo version.
</p>
<p>  <em>InSite Designer</em> is a visual HTML editor, in the style of
  HomeSite, PageMill, or Netscape Composer.  It has no frame
  support, unfortunately.  Otherwise, it is a well-arranged
  editor that lets you edit both WYSIWYG and text versions of a
  page at the same time (with cross updating).  Insite Designer
  is also $50 shareware, and the trial version nags you
  constantly during evaluation.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">(scripting) Languages</strong></p>
 <p>  An area where BeOS has almost shockingly broad support (for a
  niche OS) is in ported programming languages.  Pretty much
  everything you might imagine using for CGI work--or for general
  batch and interactive programs has a free/open-source BeOS
  port.
</p>
<p>  Perl 5.005_03 is available, as is Python 1.5.2.  Neither of
  these is quite the latest language versions, but hopefully
  those will be done soon also.  For Python, there is a module
  called "Bethon" that lets you get at the BeOS API for local
  apps.  Also of interest to web developers is the availability
  of PHP 4.04.
</p>
<p>  BeKaffe is a free and open JVM and development toolkit for
  BeOS.  Beyond the usual candidates, a <strong>partial</strong> list of
  available programming languages includes:  BeBRexx;
  BeProlog/BinProlog; BeScript; betcl; BForth; BeSqueak; guile;
  Gwydion Dylan; Hugs 98; Lua; NASM; OOC (Oberon-2); OpenScheme;
  PForth; REBOL/Core; REBOL/View; Regina Rexx; Ruby; SmallEiffel;
  Squirrel (Logo dialect); Xalan-C (XSLT); Xerces-C (XML parser).
  Most web developers will probably not have <em>heard</em> of, let
  alone use, most of these.  But it is nice to know so many
  options are supported.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Web Servers</strong></p>
 <p>  Depending on your development pattern, you may want to either
  host websites directly on BeOS, or just develop pages and code
  for uploading to a different OS webhost.  Either way, you are
  in good shape.
</p>
<p>  Built in to BeOS is basic web server called PoorMan. This is on
  the order of Windows' Personal Web Server or MacOS's Webshare.
  It is not necessarily super-high-performance, nor extremely
  sophisticated.  Then again, for basic sites, turning it on is
  only a mouse click or two away.  Using PoorMan is extremely
  easy and straightforward.
</p>
<p>  Beyond PoorMan, you have BeOS specific web servers, <code>diner</code> and
  <code>RobinHood</code>, as well as a variety of servers for NNTP, FTP,
  POP3, IMAP4, SMTP, DHCP, and other protocols.
</p>
<p>  But for serious web hosting on BeOS, go with the world's
  standard server.  Apache is available in both 1.3.x and 2.0
  (alpha 7) versions for BeOS.  All the knowledge you might have
  about Apache administration on other platforms is put to
  equally good use on BeOS.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Other Useful Utilities</strong></p>
 <p>  There are any number of useful utilities that a web developer
  on BeOS might want to pick up.  Browsing BeBits (see Resources)
  is a useful way to spend some time.  But a couple that I find
  particularly useful are worth mentioning (not web-related per
  se).
</p>
<p>  If you plan on connecting to other machines, two utilities are
  particularly important.  Secure shell (<code>ssh</code>) is a basic
  necessity for making connections to remote shell sessions, such
  as on webhosts.  This should probably be the very first thing
  you download for BeOS.  I do a lot of my work on remote hosts
  (of various sorts) this way; <code>ssh</code> gives you a shell window
  into any machine you have permissions on.
</p>
<p>  The second utility that every BeOS user should have is Virtual
  Network Computing (<code>vnc</code>).  <code>vnc</code> is a wonderful technology for
  just about every OS platform under the sun (at least those that
  use GUIs).  The idea in <code>vnc</code> is to allow one computer (running
  any old OS) to serve as a remote graphic terminal to another
  <code>vncserver</code> computer.  I can display a Linux desktop, a MacOS
  desktop, a Windows desktop, or even a remote BeOS desktop
  <em>inside</em> a BeOS window (or fullscreen in a workspace).  For
  those times when you need tool native to other platforms, you
  can turn your BeOS machine into a control console for every
  other machine in the world that you have permission to use.
  Getting <code>vnc</code> installed and setup everywhere necessary is a
  little bit of work, but less than you might think.
