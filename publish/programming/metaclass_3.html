<h1>Metaclass Programming In Python, Part 3: Cleverness Considered Harmful</h1>

  Too much cleverness in programming makes designs more complicated,
  code more fragile, learning curves steeper, and worst of all, it makes
  debugging harder. Michele and David feel, in part, responsible for
  some excesses of cleverness that followed the enthusiastic reception
  of their earlier articles on Python metaclasses. In this article, they
  attempt to make amends, by helping programmers eschew cleverness.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction

</h3>
 <p>
  Recently, co-author Michele attended the EuroPython 2006 conference.
  The conference was good, the organization perfect, the talks of very
  high level, the people extremely nice. Nonetheless, he noticed
  something of a distrurbing trend in the Python community that prompted
  this paper. About simultaneously, co-author David, was reflecting on a
  similar issue with some submitted patches to Gnosis Utilities. The
  trend at issue is the trend towards <em>cleverness</em>. Unfortunately,
  whereas once cleverness in the Python community was once largely
  confined to Zope and Twisted, it now is appearing everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  We have nothing against cleverness in experimental projects and
  learning exercises. Our gripe is with cleverness in production
  frameworks that we are forced to cope with as users. This article
  makes a small contribution against cleverness, at least in a case
  where we have some expertise, i.e. against metaclass abuses.
</p>
<p>
  For this article, at least, we take a ruthless stance: we consider
  <em>metaclass abuse</em> any usage of a metaclass where you could have solved
  the same problem equally well without a custom metaclass.  Of course,
  the guilt of the authors is obvious here: our earlier installments on
  metaclasses in Python helped popularize their usage.  <em>Nostra culpa</em>.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most common metaprogramming scenarios is the creation of
  classes with attributes and methods which are dynamically generated.
  Contrarily to popular belief, this is a job where most of the time you
  <em>do not need</em> and you <em>do not want</em> a custom metaclass; or so we argue
  in this installment.
</p>
<p>
  The paper is intended for two sets of readers: average programmers who
  would benefit from knowing a few meta-programming tricks, but are
  scared off by brain melting concepts; clever programmers who are too
  clever and should know better. The problem for the latter is that it
  is easy to be clever, whereas it takes a lot of time to become
  unclever. For instance, it took us a few months to understand how to
  use metaclasses, but a few years to understand how <em>not</em> to use them.
</p>
<h3>About Class Initialization</h3>
 <p>
  During class creation attributes and methods of classes are set once
  and for all. Or rather, in Python, methods and attributes can be
  changed at nearly any point, but only if naughty programmers sacrifice
  transparency.
</p>
<p>
  In several various common situations, a programmer may want to create
  classes in more dynamic ways than simply running static code for their
  creation. For instance, she may want to set some default class
  attributes according to parameters read from a configuration file; or
  she may want to set class properties according to the fields in a
  database table. The easiest way to dynamically customize class
  behavior uses an imperative style: first creates the class, then add
  methods and attributes. For example, an excellent programmer of our
  acquaintance, Anand Pillai has proposed a path to Gnosis Utilities'
  subpackage <code>gnosis.xml.objectify</code> that does exactly this. A base class
  called <code>gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_</code> that is specialized (at runtime) to
  hold "xml node objects" is "decorated" with a number of enhanced
  behaviors, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Dynamic enhancement of a base class</h4><pre>
setattr(_XO_, 'orig_tagname', orig_tagname)
setattr(_XO_, 'findelem', findelem)
setattr(_XO_, 'XPath', XPath)
setattr(_XO_, 'change_pcdata', change_pcdata)
setattr(_XO_,'addChild',addChild)

</pre></div><p>
  One might suggest, reasonably enough, that the same enhancement can be
  accomplished simply by subclassing the <code><cite>XO</cite></code> base class. True, in one
  sense, but Anand has provided about two dozen possible enhancements,
  and particular users might want some of them, but <em>not</em> others. There
  are too many permutations to easily create subclasses for every
  enhancement scenario. Still, the above code is not exactly <em>pretty</em>.
  One could accomplish the above sort of job with a custom metaclass,
  attached to <code><cite>XO</cite></code>, but with behavior determined dynamically, but that
  brings us back to the excessive cleverness (and opacity) that we hope
  to avoid.
</p>
<p>
  A clean, and non-ugly, solution to the above need might be to add
  class decorators to Python.  If we had those, we might write code
  similar to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>features = [('XPath',XPath), ('addChild',addChild), ('is_root',is_root)]
@enhance(features)
class _XO_plus(gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_): pass
gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_ = _XO_plus

</pre></div><p>
  That syntax, however, is a thing of the future, if it becomes
  available at all.
</p>
<h3>When Metaclasses Become Complicated</h3>
 <p>
  It might seem like all the fuss in this paper, so far is about
  nothing.  Why not just, e.g. define the metaclass of <code><cite>XO</cite></code> as
  <code>Enhance</code>, and be done with it.  <code>Enhance.__init__()</code> can happily add
  whatever capabilities are needed for the particular use in question.
  This might look like, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>A fragile metaclass</h4><pre>
class _XO_plus(gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_):
      __metaclass__ = Enhance
      features = [('XPath',XPath), ('addChild',addChild)]
gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_ = _XO_plus

</pre></div><p>
  Unfortunately, things are not so simple once you start to worry about
  inheritance. Once you have defined a custom metaclass for your base
  class, all the derived classes will inherit the metaclass, so the
  initialization code will be run on all derived classes, magically and
  implicitly. This may be fine in specific circumstances (for instance,
  suppose you have to register in your framework all the classes you
  define: using a metaclass ensures that you cannot forget to register a
  derived class), however, in many cases you may not like this behavior
  because:
</p>
<blockquote>
    1. You believe that <em>explicit is better than implicit</em>;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    2. The derived classes have the same dynamic class attributes of the
    base class. Setting them again for each derived class is a waste
    since they would be available anyway by inheritance; this may be an
    especially significant issue if the initialization code is slow or
    computationally expensive. You might add a check in the metaclass
    code to see if the attributes were already set in a parent class,
    but this adds plumbing and it does not give real control on a
    per-class basis;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    3. A custom metaclass will make your classes somewhat magic and
    nonstandard: you may not want to increase your chances to incur in
    metaclass conflicts, issues with ``__slots__``, fights with (Zope)
    extension classes, and other guru-level intricacies. Metaclasses are
    more fragile than many people realize. We have rarely used them for
    production code, even after four years of usage in experimental
    code.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    4. You feel that a custom metaclasses is overkill for the simple job
    of class initialization and you would rather use a simpler solution.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In other words,you should use a custom metaclass only when your real
  intention is to have code running on derived classes without users of
  those classes noticing it. If this is not your case, skip the
  metaclass and make your life (and that of your users) happier.
</p>
<h3>The Classinitializer Decorator</h3>
 <p>
  What we present in the rest of this paper might be accused of
  cleverness. But the cleverness need not burden users, just us authors.
  Readers can do something much akin to the hypothetical (non-ugly)
  class decorator we propose, but without enountering the inheritance
  and metaclass conflict issues the metaclass approach raises. The "deep
  magic" decorator we give in full later generally just enhances the
  straightforward (but slightly ugly) imperative approach, and is
  "morally equivalent" to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Wrapping imperative enhancement</h4><pre>
def Enhance(cls, **kw):
    for k, v in kw.iteritems():
        setattr(cls, k, v)
class ClassToBeInitialized(object):
    pass
Enhance(ClassToBeInitialized, a=1, b=2)

</pre></div><p>
  The above imperative enhancer is not so bad. But it has a few
  drawbacks: It make you repeat the class name; readability is
  suboptimal since class definition and class initialization are
  separated--for long class definitions you can miss the last line; it
  feels wrong to first define something and then immediately mutate it.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>classinitializer</code> decorator provides a declarative solution. The
  decorator converts <code>Enhance(cls,**kw)</code> into a method that can be used
  in a class definition:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>The magic decarator in basic operation</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; @classinitializer # add magic to Enhance
... def Enhance(cls, **kw):
...     for k, v in kw.iteritems():
...         setattr(cls, k, v)
&gt;&gt;&gt; class ClassToBeInitialized(object):
...     Enhance(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ClassToBeInitialized.a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; ClassToBeInitialized.b
2

</pre></div><p>
  If you have used Zope interfaces, you may have seen examples of class
  initializers (<code>zope.interface.implements</code>). In fact,
  <code>classinitializer</code> is implemented by using a trick copied from
  <code>zope.interface.advice</code>, which credits Phillip J. Eby. The trick uses
  the ``__metaclass__`` hook, but it <em>does not use</em> a custom metaclass.
  <code>ClassToBeInitialized</code> keeps its original metaclass, i.e. the plain
  built-in metaclass <code>type</code> of new style classes:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(ClassToBeInitialized)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  In principle, the trick also works for old style classes, and it would
  be easy to write an implementation keeping old style classes old
  style. However, since according to Guido "old style classes are
  morally deprecated", the current implementation converts old style
  classes into new style classes:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Promotion to newstyle</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class WasOldStyle:
...     Enhance(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; WasOldStyle.a, WasOldStyle.b
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(WasOldStyle)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  One of the motivations for the <code>classinitializer</code> decorator, is to
  hide the plumbing, and to make mere mortals able to implements their
  own class initializers in an easy way, without knowing the details of
  how class creation works and the secrets of the <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook.
  The other motivation, is that even for Python wizards it is very
  inconvenient to rewrite the code managing the <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook
  every time one writes a new class initializer.
</p>
<p>
  As a final note, let us point out that the decorated version of
  <code>Enhance</code> is smart enough to continue to work as a non-decorated
  version outside a class scope, provided that you pass to it an
  explicit class argument:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; Enhance(WasOldStyle, a=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; WasOldStyle.a
2

</pre></div><h3>The (overly) Deep Magic</h3>
 <p>
  Here is the code for <code>classinitializer</code>. You do not need to understand
  it to use the decorator:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>The 'classinitializer' decorator</h4><pre>
import sys
def classinitializer(proc):
   # basic idea stolen from zope.interface.advice, P.J. Eby
   def newproc(*args, **kw):
       frame = sys._getframe(1)
       if '__module__' in frame.f_locals and not \
           '__module__' in frame.f_code.co_varnames: # we are in a class
           if '__metaclass__' in frame.f_locals:
               raise SyntaxError("Don't use two class initializers or\n"
                 "a class initializer together with a __metaclass__ hook")
           def makecls(name, bases, dic):
               try:
                   cls = type(name, bases, dic)
               except TypeError, e:
                   if "can't have only classic bases" in str(e):
                       cls = type(name, bases + (object,), dic)
                   else:  # other strange errs, e.g. __slots__ conflicts
                       raise
               proc(cls, *args, **kw)
               return cls
           frame.f_locals["__metaclass__"] = makecls
       else:
           proc(*args, **kw)
 newproc.__name__ = proc.__name__
 newproc.__module__ = proc.__module__
 newproc.__doc__ = proc.__doc__
 newproc.__dict__ = proc.__dict__
 return newproc

</pre></div><p>
  From the implementation it is clear how class initializers work: when
  you call a class initializer inside a class, your are actually
  defining a <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook that will be called by the class'
  metaclass (typically <code>type</code>). The metaclass will create the class
  (as a new style one) and will pass it to the class initializer
  procedure.
</p>
<h3>Tricky points and caveats
</h3>
 <p>
  Since class initializers (re)define the <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook, they
  don't play well with classes that define a <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook
  explicitly (as opposed to implicitly inheriting one). If a
  <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook is defined <em>after</em> the class initializer, it
  <em>silently</em> overrides it.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Local metaclass creates a problem</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C:
...     Enhance(a=1)
...     def __metaclass__(name, bases, dic):
...         cls = type(name, bases, dic)
...         print 'Enhance is silently ignored'
...         return cls
...
Enhance is silently ignored
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'a'

</pre></div><p>
  While unfortunate, there is no general solution to this issue; we
  simply document it. On the other hand, if you call a class initializer
  <em>after</em> the <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook, you will get an exception:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Local metaclass raises an error</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C:
...     def __metaclass__(name, bases, dic):
...         cls = type(name, bases, dic)
...         print 'calling explicit __metaclass__'
...         return cls
...     Enhance(a=1)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
SyntaxError: Don't use two class initializers or
a class initializer together with a __metaclass__ hook

</pre></div><p>
  Raising an error is preferable to silently overriding your
  explicit <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hook.  As a consequence, you will get an
  error if you try to use two class initializers at the same time, or if
  you call twice the same one:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Doubled enhancement creates a problem</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C:
...     Enhance(a=1)
...     Enhance(b=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
SyntaxError: Don't use two class initializers or
a class initializer together with a__metaclass__ hook

</pre></div><p>
  On the plus side, all issues for inherited <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> hooks and
  for custom metaclasses are handled:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Happy to enhance inherited metaclass</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B: # a base class with a custom metaclass
...     class __metaclass__(type):
...         pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(B): # class with both custom metaclass AND class initializer
...     Enhance(a=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(C)
&lt;class '_main.__metaclass__'&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The class initializer does not disturb the metaclass of <code>C</code>, which is
  the one inherited by base <code>B</code>, and the inherited metaclass does not
  disturb the class initializer, which does its job just fine. You would
  have run into trouble, instead, if you tried to call <code>Enhance</code>
  directly in the base class.
</p>
<h3>Putting It Together</h3>
 <p>
  With all this machinery defined, customizing class initialization
  becomes rather straightforward, and elegant looking.  It might be
  something as simple as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Simplest form enhancement</h4><pre>
class _XO_plus(gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_):
    Enhance(XPath=XPath, addChild=addChild, is_root=is_root)
gnosis.xml.objectify._XO_ = _XO_plus

</pre></div><p>
  This example still uses the "injection" which is somewhat superfluous
  to the general case; i.e. we put the enhanced class back into a
  specific name in the module namespace.  It is necessary for the
  particular module, but will not be needed most of the time.  In any
  case, the argument to to <code>Enhance()</code> need not be fixed in code as
  above, you can equally use <code>Enhance(**feature_set)</code> for something
  completely dynamic.
</p>
<p>
  The other point to keep in mind is that your <code>Enhance()</code> function can
  do rather more than the simple version suggested above.  The decorator
  is more than happy to tweak more sophisticated enhancement functions.
  For example, here is one that adds "records" to a class:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Variations on class enhancement</h4><pre>
@classinitializer
def def_properties(cls, schema):
    """
    Add properties to cls, according to the schema, which is a list
    of pairs (fieldname, typecast). A typecast is a
    callable converting the field value into a Python type.
    The initializer saves the attribute names in a list cls.fields
    and the typecasts in a list cls.types. Instances of cls are expected
    to have private attributes with names determined by the field names.
    """
    cls.fields = []
    cls.types = []
    for name, typecast in schema:
        if hasattr(cls, name): # avoid accidental overriding
            raise AttributeError('You are overriding %s!' % name)
        def getter(self, name=name):
            return getattr(self, '_' + name)
        def setter(self, value, name=name, typecast=typecast):
            setattr(self, '_' + name, typecast(value))
        setattr(cls, name, property(getter, setter))
        cls.fields.append(name)
        cls.types.append(typecast)

</pre></div><p>
  The differing concerns of (a) what is enhanced; (b) how the magic
  works; and (c) what the basic class itself does are kept orthogonal:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Customizing a record class</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Article(object):
...    # fields and types are dynamically set by the initializer
...    def_properties([('title', str), ('author', str), ('date', date)])
...    def __init__(self, values): # add error checking if you like
...        for field, cast, value in zip(self.fields, self.types, values):
...            setattr(self, '_' + field, cast(value))
