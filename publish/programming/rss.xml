    <title>LINUX ZONE FEATURE: Linux on PowerPC Processors
Your favorite operating system isn't only for x86</title>
    <link>www/publish/programming/publish/programming/linuxppc.html</link>
    <description>    Even though most Linux users have treated Linux as an operating
    system for their x86 white boxes, Linux runs equally well on PowerPC
    machines.  With the appealing range of PPC machines produced by
    Apple, the option of using Linux on one of these is of great value
    to many users.</description>

    <title>LINUX ZONE FEATURE: Regina and NetRexx
Scripting with Free Software Rexx Implementations</title>
    <link>www/publish/programming/publish/programming/rexx.html</link>
    <description>    It is easy to get lost in the world of "little languages"--quite a
    few have been written to scratch some itch of a company, individual
    or project.  Rexx is one of these languages, with a long history of
    use on IBM OS's, and good current implementations for Linux and
    other Free Software operating systsems.  Moreover, David argues that
    Rexx occupies a useful ecological niche between the relative
    crudeness of shell scripting and the cumbersome formality of full
    systems languages.  Many Linux programmers and systems
    administrators would benefit from adding a Rexx implementation to
    their collection of go-to tools.</description>

    <title>XML MATTERS #31: SXML and SSAX
Manipulating XML in the Scheme Programming Language</title>
    <link>www/publish/programming/publish/programming/xml_matters_31.html</link>
    <description>    Previous installments have looked at XML libraries for various
    programming languages, and with various strengths and weaknesses.
    The Lisp family of languages remains popular, especially in teaching
    and among purists. The SSAX library for Scheme is an efficient
    pure-functional parser; SXML is a tree library (like DOM); and
    related tools SXSLT and SXPath have been created to work with these.
    This installment looks at the advantages of parsing in a strongly
    functional language, and compares SSAX with libraries for other
    languages.</description>

    <title>XML MATTERS #33: XML for Word Processors
Open source embraces XML as native document format</title>
    <link>www/publish/programming/publish/programming/xml_matters_33.html</link>
    <description>    In their recent versions, the three major Free Software word
    processing programs have all adopted XML formats as their native
    document format. The approach to XML taken by AbiWord, KOffice's
    KWord, and OpenOffice.org Writer differs somewhat between the
    applications-- largely reflecting the underlying development focus
    of each project. But all open source word processor developers have
    realized the advantages of XML as a document format:
    componentization of parsers and writers; openness and formality of
    format specification; applicability of XSLT and other transformation
    APIs.</description>
