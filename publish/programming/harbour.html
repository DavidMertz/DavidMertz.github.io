<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<p><em>This article sketches some brief details of the internal
workings of Harbour, but focuses on the ordinary details of getting
Harbour set up; and on recompiling existing Clipper programs (possibly
to new platforms).  A particular emphasis is given to the setup on
Linux, but notes are also made on its other ported platforms.  Some
general observations are made on current limitations of Harbour
relative to other Clipper implementations on which a developer might
have an existing codebase.</em></p>

<!-- BODY -->
<p><!-- What is Harbour? -->
   Harbour is a collaborative project that began in 1999.  The goal of
   the Harbour Project is to create a cross-platform and open-source
   compiler for the xbase superset language known as Clipper.  Clipper
   was implemented first, and as Harbour's reference implementation, in
   CA-Clipper 5.2 (and largely in earlier versions of CA-Clipper); but
   supersets of Clipper have also been implemented commercially in at
   least Alaska Software's xBase++, Multisoft's Flagship and Computer
   Associates' Visual Objects.  In less than a year, Harbour has moved
   from preliminary discussions to a 95% functional implementation.  And
   unlike each of the other Clipper implementations, the source code is
   available under a modified GPL, and ports have been made to Linux,
   DOS, Win32, OS/2 and MacOS.  One interesting feature, technically, of
   Harbour is its output:  rather than output platform-specific object
   code, Harbour's compiler outputs source code in C, Java (incomplete),
   Pascal (planned), Windows Resource (planned) or a 'Harbour Runtime
   Binary' (hrb).  From there, your existing compiler/linker takes over
   to produce a native executable by linking to the runtime libraries and
   Harbour virtual machine (VM).  Alternately, a compiled native runtime
   interpreter can process an .hrb file.
</p><p>
   Despite the progress made to date, at the time of this article Harbour
   is still in alpha versions.  It is probably not yet a very good idea to
   consider Harbour for production environments; but the progress made
   makes it look like it will be ready soon (contributors to the project
   are always welcomed, of course).  In particular, the documentation is
   still in a pretty rough state, and what there is--while generally
   well-written--is aimed primarily at the Harbour developers themselves.
   A Clipper programmer who is not necessarily also a C programmer or a
   compiler designer will probably still encounter a few bumps along the
   way.  Hopefully, after this author works through a few of these little
   bumps himself, this article will ease the path to working with Harbour.

   <!-- Intro to installation -->
   Being at an alpha version, the degree of compatibility and functionality
   differs somewhat between ported platforms; and the installation on all
   platforms is still a manual process.  Unfortunately, this turns out to
   mean (at least as of this writting) that the Linux version lags behind
   the Win32, DOS and OS/2 versions in some important ways.  The main
   problem right now is that the console I/O under Linux is basically
   broken.  While the plan by the developers is to provide both
   <tt>curses</tt> and <tt>slang</tt> library compatibility, the latter will
   not compile at all yet, and the former is only partially functional.  The
   bottom line is that Harbour on Linux is only currently robust for batch
   oriented processes and command-line driven utilities (see the sidebar on
   "CGI and HarbourScript", however).</p>

<p><!-- Linux Installation Steps -->
   <strong>Linux installation.</strong>
   Installing on Linux is similar to most Linux installations, although there
   is a little bit more to it than the simplest <tt>make/make install</tt>
   setup.  The first thing to do for any version you wish to install is to
   visit the download section of the <http://www.Harbour-Project.org/>Harbour
   web site</a>.  For Linux, download the source code, which should be in a
   tarball with a name similar to <tt>harbour-0.33.src.tar.gz</tt>.  On my
   own system, I decided to work only at a user level (it is, after all,
   alpha software; and besides, many users will not have root access).  I
   put the tarball in a ~/Harbour/ directory, and ran the below commands:</p>

   <p><strong>Shell commands to setup Harbour</strong>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%">
      <tr><td><pre>
<font color="#FF0000">1</font>  $ gunzip -c harbour-0.33.src.tar.gz | tar -x
<font color="#FF0000">2</font>  $ cd harbour-0.33
<font color="#FF0000">3</font>  $ export HB_GT_LIB=gtcrs
<font color="#FF0000">4</font>  $ export C_USR=-DHARBOUR_USE_CRS_GTAPI
<font color="#FF0000">5</font>  $ chmod u+x make_gnu.sh
<font color="#FF0000">6</font>  $ ./make_gnu.sh &gt; make_gnu.log
<font color="#FF0000">7</font>  $ ln -f source/compiler/linux/gcc/harbour ~/bin

<font color="#FF0000">10</font> $ ln -f utils/hbdoc/linux/gcc/hbdoc ~/bin      </pre>
       </td></tr></table></p>

<p><!-- Explanation of shell commands -->
   A few comments are warranted on what I do above.  The <tt>make_gnu.sh</tt>
   script, run in (6), is a wrapper for GNU <tt>make</tt> that sets a
   few environment variables first.  Two variables that are <i>not</i> set
   by default, but need to be for any console support other than tty-style
   are C_USR and HB_GT_LIB.  Eventually, these will also support values
   for the <tt>slang</tt> libraries (and maybe others like XTM or KDE) but
   currently only <tt>ncurses</tt> can compile.  As a minor matter, the
   provided <tt>make_gnu.sh</tt> does not have execute permissions when unpacked,
   so you'll either want to change its permission or pass it to a shell
   explicitly, as in (5).  I found it helpful to redirect the <tt>make</tt>
   results to a file in (5) so that they could be examined later, and also
   so that the STDERR messages will stand out more evidently.  I received
   a non-fatal warning in alpha 0.32, which was corrected in 0.33; you might
   still get one or two such warnings while Harbour is in other alphas. In
   (7)-(10) I found it convenient to create links in a standard location for
   the harbour executables that should be created.

<p><!-- Installation on other OS's -->
   <strong>Installation on other Operating Systems.</strong>
   Under Win32, DOS and OS/2, prebuilt Harbour binaries are available, which
   really saves a lot of work for a novice trying to get a feel for Harbour.
   Zip files are available for a variety of compiler/OS combinations.  If
   you intend to compile your own executables, you will need to download
   a version compatible with the C compiler you intend to use.  Fortunately,
   a variety of free and non-free C compilers are supported.  Once you get the
   right zip file, just unpack it where you want Harbour to live (if you use
   <tt>pkunzip</tt>, be sure to use the <tt>-d</tt> option to maintain
   subdirectory structure).
</p><p>
   The current binary distributions also include the <tt>hbrun.exe</tt>
   utility which will run an <tt>.hrb</tt> file for you without the need for
   linking an executable (<tt>hbrun.exe</tt> uses some assembly that cannot
   yet be built with every compiler/OS combination, but every OS has some
   version of <tt>hbrun.exe</tt> available).  As a quick way to get started,
   this is very easy (the sample directory and source file below come from
   the Harbour source distribution): </p>

<p><strong class="subhead">Porting considerations</strong><BR>
   Probably the main issue in porting a legacy Clipper project to Harbour
   will be the portability of the libraries used in the original project.
   To a large extent, calls to third-party libraries will have to be
   rewritten, either in the Harbour language (which includes some enhancements
   to the traditional DOS/CA-Clipper capabilities), or in C as upgraded
   capabilities for the Harbour system itself.
</p><p>
   However, the Harbour developers have made some efforts in the direction
   of supporting common CA-Clipper libraries, as well as with improving
   compatibility with Alaska's XBase++.  A few third party tools have even
   started to provide Harbour ports.  Of course, many popular CA-Clipper
   libraries--such as SuperLib and Grumpfish--are already written primarily
   in Clipper, and come with source code to allow end-user modification.
   In the case of such libraries, porting to Harbour is likely to be fairly
   straightforward, even if not necessarily completely effortless.  I sketch
   below some of the library issues already addressed by the Harbour
   developers, or by third-parties.
</p><p>
   <ul>
   <li><em>GT Clipper Library.</em>
       A public domain library created by a number of contributors that
       contains various useful general-purpose functions.  The Harbour
       developers have decided to directly support some, but not all, of
       the GT Library.  All GT Library functions begin with 'GT_' for
       compatibility, but the calls are integrated into Harbour rather
       than treated as a seperate library.
   <li><em>Clipper Tools.</em>
       A large and popular collection of functions
       produced by Computer Associates.  The use of Clipper Tools was
       sufficiently widespread as to be considered almost an integral part
       of CA-Clipper.  Some--but far from all--Clipper Tools functions
       are supported by Harbour.
   <li><em>Fivewin.</em>
       A library designed for development of Windows applications within
       CA-Clipper.  It has also been ported to Alaska's XBase++.  A
       preliminary version of Fivewin for Harbour has been written,
       and links to it may be found in the "Resources" section of this
       article.
   <li><em>Advantage Database Server (ADS).</em>
       A product used for
       implementing Clipper applications on a client/server model, and
       optimizing database queries. Serves a similar niche to SQL databases,
       and is compatible with a number of programming tools.  Discussion of
       using Harbour programs to connect with an ADS server, and sample
       source code, is available in the <tt>/contrib</tt> directory of
       the Harbour system.
   <li><em>DirectX.</em>
       This is not a library issue as such, but discussion
       and sample source is provided in the <tt>/contrib</tt> directory for
       utilizing DirectX within Harbour (under the Win32 version, of course).
   <li><em>ODBC.</em>
       As with DirectX, this is not a legacy library issue,
       but rather an enhanced capability experimentally built onto the
       Harbour system.  It is also available as a discussion and code samples
       in the <tt>/contrib</tt> directory.
   <li><em>Object Oriented Programming.</em>
       Programming in an OOP style is a broader issue than a specific
       library or a specific interface.  But OOP programming is something
       many Clipper programmers have come to expect.  CA-Clipper 5.2 and
       especially 5.3 added a number of base classes, and a matching
       OOP syntax.  Libraries such as CLASSy, Fivewin, Clip4Win, and TopClass
       provide OOP extensions with full inheritance and class declaration.
       Clipper-compatible compilers like XBase++ and Flagship also provided
       their own OOP extensions.  Luckily, Harbour follows suit in providing
       a full collection of commands for declaration of classes, inheritance,
       and so on.  The syntax may not wind up being identical with that in
       the tool you previously used, but it should be possible to maintain
       your old Clipper class hierarchy with minimal changes to source code.
   </ul>
</p>

<p><strong class="subhead">A sample project</strong><br>
   <!-- Sidebar on CGI and HarbourScript -->
   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="sidebar" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td>
   <strong class="subhead">CGI and HarbourScript</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>There is at least one thing that Harbour is well suited for that
       CA-Clipper was rarely ever used for:  CGI scripting.  The Clipper
       language has a large number of the high-level constructs for
       dealing with both text and data that one finds in the most common
       CGI languages.  In this direction, the Harbour developers have
       provided both an HTML object in the OOP system, and some sample
       code for working with CGI.</li>
   <li>In addition to conventional CGI, the Harbour <tt>./sample</tt>
       directory contains an interesting side project called HarbourScript.
       The idea of HarbourScript is to allow one to use the Harbour
       language in a way similar to Active Server Pages or Cold Fusion;
       but instead of JavaScript or VBScript, the embedded language is
       Clipper. Like most of Harbour, this side project is still in
       alpha stages; but the interesting thing is that it works at all,
       and the proof-of-concept has already been staged on websites.

   <!-- About Y2KComp -->
   As a test of porting to Harbour, I decided to use a smallish (in the
   neighborhood of 1000 lines), but real-life project.  <tt>Y2KComp</tt>
   is a utility I created in late 1998 as a consultant at a large company
   performing Y2K code remediation.   I had since released the code to the
   public domain; so feel free to download it from the link in the
   "Resources" section if you wish.  It is probably of little continuing
   use now that we have passed through the Y2K new-year, but it does have
   the virtue of using much of the most common functionality of Clipper.
   In a nutshell, Y2KComp reads in a few values, then performs a "aged-date
   consistency" comparison on two files.  That is, we do not want to
   determine just if two files are identical, but rather if all the date
   difference between the two files are consistent.  Add a 'mutatis mutandis'
   clause to the notion of sameness.  These files may be DBFs, free-form
   reports, comma delimited files, or fixed-length flat-files.  A moderate
   degree of machine intelligence goes into determining what sort of
   differences are to be expected, and what sort indicates a problem.  At
   the end of the comparison, a textual report is produced summarizing the
   comparison results.  In other words, we get some DBF acess, some file I/O,
   some date functions, some numeric functions, some string functions, and
   the GET system.  Furthermore, I had created both a DOS and a Fivewin
   version of the same program (sharing most of the code in common), so
   potentially this could be a test of Fivewin for Harbour (but not in
   this article).
</p><p>
   <strong>Compiling under Win32.</strong>
   Building the program under WinNT 4.0 was pretty uneventful.  There were
   just a few quick workarounds and shortcuts I took that are worth noting.
   The original utility was built from 4 <tt>.prg</tt> source files.
   It had been built using a PVCS make file, so the old environment was a
   bit different from the current one.  As a shortcut in this small project,
   I just added a few <tt>#include "filename.prg"</tt> statements at the
   end of the main source file.  This saved the work of creating a new
   makefile using GNU make, or my C compiler's facilities.
</p><p>
   A bit more significant was the fact I had also used a call to SWPRUNCMD()
   in the original program, which is a function in the Blinker library (to
   run a child process in a more DOS-memory-friendly way than CA-Clipper's
   RUN).  The issue behind this is a bit antiquated, but other legacy code
   might use this or other Blinker functions.  This particular call was to
   run an external program presumed to be called 'EDIT' on the report file
   that is created by running the utility.  I tried two things here: (1)
   Just remove the call altogether (and look at the report using whatever
   viewer I wish); (2) Substitute a call to the RUN command.  The first
   worked fine, of course.  The second produced a slightly odd effect.
   The console did not clear its previous screen, but the cursor highlight
   moved within the screen, as if EDIT.COM was launched.  Upon forcing a
   close of the window, I saw a brief flash of what was apparently the
   EDIT.COM screen.  It appears that the child process is having its console
   output blocked in some manner; I did not, however, experiment to determine
   if this effect was specific to particular child applications.
</p><p>
   <strong>Compiling under Linux.</strong>
   Building the <tt>Y2KComp</tt> project under Linux had a number of
   additional issues beyond those for Win32.  I used the same <tt>#include</tt>
   shortcut as under Win32; and I also had the same issue with Blinker
   library functions. More significantly were a mix of issues that one
   will always expect under Linux with ones that reflect the unfinished
   version of Harbour I was working with.  The main problem is the
   incomplete console I/O handling.  DBF support and file I/O is in pretty
   good shape even in the alpha 0.32, and the functions are almost all
   implemented.
</p><p>
   Here are some issues to expect under Linux, even with later versions of
   Harbour:  (1) Linux uses a case-sensitive filesystem, while DOS, OS/2
   and Windows do not.  This will not be news to developers, but a few steps
   are likely to be required.  Specifically, I found that I had used a
   variety of <tt>#include</tt>'s in the project (including those I added
   for the Win32 version above) where the case of the filename used did not
   match that in the actual filesystem.  Since Clipper was never
   case-sensitive in its keywords (unlike a lot of languages), a Clipper
   programmer had some flexibility in when to use caps that was stylistic
   rather than functional; but some of that is restricted under Linux.
   (2) <tt>curses</tt>/<tt>slang</tt> support will only work under a Linux
   console, not under a KDE Konsole or an xterm window.  There may
   eventually be support for all the styles of Linux terminal windows, but
   most likely the Linux console will be supported first.
</p><p>
   I also encountered some difficulties with compiling/linking the default
   Harbour output of intermediate C files.  There were not included in
   the release I worked with any shell scripts analogous to the
   <tt>bld_vc.bat</tt> files for Windows.  Although the <tt>bld_tpl.cmd</tt>
   contained some lines for using <tt>gcc</tt> under OS/2 that seemed
   similar to what was needed, an initial effort to adapt it to a shell
   script still produced some linking errors.  Overall, I found it most
   direct simply to use the <tt>.hrb</tt> output format, and the
   <tt>hbrun</tt> utility to get up-and-running with sample programs, e.g.:

   The console I/O problems I encounted in alpha 0.32 are discussed
   below.  Some are fairly serious, and unfortunately, a quick examination
   of alpha 0.33--released at press times--shows that it does not yet
   address these issues, for the most part.  (1) <tt>curses</tt> support is
   still monochrome.  This suffices for the basic GET/SAY of the sample
   program, but anything with a complicated screen design is likely to rely
   on color elements (some color appears in 0.33, but so do some other screen
   artifacts). (2) <tt>INKEY()</tt> codes are not trapped correctly.
   Specifically, arrow keys are treated as an ESC and/or abnormally
   terminate an application. This limitation makes it impossible to use
   <tt>ACHOICE()</tt> or <tt>MENU TO</tt> for item selection.  This again
   makes complex user interaction difficult.  (3) Possibly related to the
   <tt>INKEY()</tt> codes, <tt>READ</tt> doesn't behave as expected.  An
   ENTER will not terminate a read, CTRL-W is required.  This also changes
   the interaction a user expects.  Each of the above issues greatly limit
   the possibilities for user interaction in an application.  I expect,
   they will all be improved in later releases (largely by 0.34 according
   to a developer working on this aspect).
</p>

<p><strong class="subhead">Conclusion</strong><br>
   Despite those difficulties I encountered using Harbour in its current
   versions, I believe that Harbour is "the future of xbase" (a slogan
   of the developers).  While it will be a while before Harbour is faster,
   has smaller executables, is more stable, or has any such positive attribute
   over commercial Clipper implementations, it is the very fact the
   Harbour is open source that makes it so exciting.  Commercial vendors
   may drop their compiler products any day they wish; and even as long as
   they support them it will be on the platform, price-basis, and license
   terms that the vendor wishes.  With Harbour, <b>you</b> have all the source
   to the compiler and the right to enhance it, improve it, or re-platform
   it however you want (as well as an intelligent and committed developers
   community behind it).  And even today, Harbour has better cross-platform
   support than any other Clipper implementation.  A modified GPL assures
   that Harbour will remain free forever (but the modification grants you
   the right to distribute applications compiled <em>with</em> Harbour on
   whatever terms you want).
