<h1>Multicasting Strategies: Understanding Reliability<h1>
<h2></h2>
 <p>Brad Huntting, University of Colorado<br>

 April 2003<br>
 <br>
</p>
<p>
  In the first and second installments we introduced the basic
  concepts of multicasting and issues of network topology.  In
  this installment Brad and David discuss how the network
  architecture of multicast can be combined with reliability
  assurances for the transmitted datastreams.
</p>
<h3>What Is Reliability?</h3>
 <p>
  One of the thorny issues Internet multicast faces is
  reliability.  Reliability, in digital transmission contexts,
  has three aspects:  Assuring the data arrives at its
  destination:
</p>
<blockquote>
    (a) uncorrupted;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    (b) in sequence;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    (c) in a timely manner.
</blockquote>
<p>
  However, in the connectionless model of the Internet, packets
  are delivered on a "best effort" basis, and there is no
  guarantee about when, or even if, an individual packet will
  arrive at its destination.  How can higher-layer mechanism make
  up for the lack of reliability at lower network layers?
</p>
<p>
  In reality, it is impossible to make reliability guarantees in
  all possible network failure scenario; at base, reliability is
  actually a question of preferred failure modes.  Which do you
  prefer, for example:  An intact data stream with no holes, or a
  time limit on network delay?  Do you mind if a few bits are
  flipped, or would you rather drop a whole packet?  Do you want
  packets delivered in order, or just delivered as fast as
  possible?
</p>
<p>
  As an example, music should be played at a constant tempo and
  missing data should produce synchronized audio drop out.  This
  failure mode is the most acceptable degradation of output.
  Many common audio players, nonetheless, have improperly
  optimized failure modes--they allow unpleasant failure
  characteristics, such as skipping ahead when they encounter
  holes in streaming data.
</p>
<h3>Transmission Control Protocol And Realtime Transport Protocol</h3>
 <p>
  In the unicast world, reliability is usually provided by
  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  TCP provides multiple
  coherently-ordered, error-checked datastreams between two
  hosts.  TCP works by active acknowledgment:  each side of the
  connection notifies the other of how much sequential data it
  has received.  In this way, a lost packet can easily be
  detected and retransmitted.  TCP also detects network
  congestion, and takes steps to ensure that a socket uses only
  its share of available bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
  "Classic" multicast multimedia applications such as "vic" and
  "vat" (multicast video and audio conferencing tools
  respectively), use the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) to
  organize their data streams.  RTP is non-reliable in the sense
  that it has no mechanism to recover data that is lost in
  transit.  Where TCP uses a 32 bit sequence number (i.e. a byte
  count) to maintain the order of the packets, RTP uses a 32 bit
  relative fixed point timestamp which can be used to ensure that
  data is decoded in the correct order and presented at the
  correct time.  A session-identifier field helps label disparate
  media streams such as audio and video <code>tracks</code>, so they can be
  grouped together and synchronized using the timestamps.  RTP is
  typically run over User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides
  a data integrity check.
</p>
<h3>Environmental Requirements</h3>
 <p>
  Many applications require more reliability aspects than just
  correct ordering and per packet data integrity.  Suppose a
  daily file transfer sends a 500 megabyte file to a million
  recipients, once a night.  To unicast such a file would require
  around 50 Gb/s of bandwith--any way you cut it, that's
  expensive.  With multicast this transmission could, in theory,
  be carried on a single 64 Kb/s ISDN.  The trick is making sure
  that the file arrives intact at every receiver.
</p>
<p>
  Adapting TCP's ACK scheme has problems.  If every receiver sent
  ACKs directly to the sender, the return ACK traffic could grow
  linearly with the number of receivers--this is called an "ACK
  implosion."  If the receivers were to back off, and send ACKs
  less frequently as the number of listeners increased, then the
  ACKs would become too spaced-out to be useful.  Having
  receivers send negative acknowledgments (NACKs) when they
  detected missing data is one solution.  But care must be taken
  to ensure that a packet dropped near the root of the multicast
  distribution tree does not create a NACK implosion, should all
  the recipients decide to NACK simultaneously.
</p>
<h3>Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group Guidelines</h3>
 <p>
  To establish a set of standard reliable multicast transport
  protocols, the Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group (RMT)
  of the Internet Engineering Task Force[1] created a set of
  guidelines that developers should address in any proposed
  protocol.  Once implemented, they will, hopefully, be of
  general use to a wide variety of applications
</p>
<p>
  It was clear from the RMT's outset that different applications
  would require different aspects of reliability.  Unlike the
  unicast world where TCP is nearly universal, it is unlikely
  that any single reliable multicast transport protocol will be
  acceptable for all applications.  So the working group has
  focused on creating protocol modules which can be plugged
  together to provide different forms of reliability.
</p>
<p>
  The RMT's current focus is on three types of modules:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>*</strong> Nack Oriented Reliable Multicast protocol (NORM) uses
    negative acknowledgments for reliability.  It avoids the NACK
    implosion problem by having all recipients listen to NACKs,
    and/or by using a probabilistic delays to void redundant
    NACKs. NORM is capable of working over both any source and
    single source multicast.  While NORM can carry so-called
    non-finite data streams, it will probably be most useful in
    batch file transfer applications.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>*</strong> TRee ACKnowledment based protocol (TRACK) uses a tree for
    controlling feedback and repairs.  TRACK has the capability
    of giving the sender a confirmation receipt for each
    receiver.  This can be important, for example, in financial
    applications in which the receivers pay for the data--the
    sender needs confirmation that it can charge the recipients
    for the data.  TRACK may not be a good choice for networks
    where the return path from receiver to sender is very
    limited, such as satellite based networks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>*</strong> Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) uses forward
    error-correction (FEC) techniques and does not require any
    feedback.  Forward error correction is a technique wherein
    the sender encodes a message of N symbols (such as bits or
    packets) as N+P symbols which are transmitted to the
    receiver.  The receiver needs only recover N of the symbols
    to reconstruct the original message; up to P symbols may be
    lost or corrupted in transit.  In practice, most FEC schemes
    transmit the N original packets as-is, and create additional
    parity packets which can be used to recover some of those
    packets, should they be lost.
</blockquote>
<h3>Relay Networks And The Their Successor</h3>
 <p>
  The currently-limited state of multicast deployment has kept
  reliable multicast out of the limelight.  Fortunately, progress
  on tools and standardization has continued, and is
  accelerating.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, application architects needing a mechanism to
  reliably deliver data to a diverse group of receivers on the
  Internet have been forced to create distribution trees using
  unicast links between participating receivers.  This technique
  is called "Application Multicast"; it is used by applications
  such as Icecast, Gnutella, and Freenet[2], and packages such as
  Xbone[3].  Application multicast usually works by creating a
  (virtual) overlay network using unicast Internet links.  The
  main advantage of this approach--and the reason it is used at
  all--is that the implementation expense is borne by the users.
  The participating nodes in the overlay network take
  responsibility for replicating data and constructing the
  distribution trees.
</p>
<p>
  The performance of the overlay network can be severely degraded
  when users are behind slow DSL or Cable modem links; this
  situation is compounded by the asymmetric bandwidth
  capabilities of such links.  Getting the topology of an overlay
  network correct is no easy task, especially when nodes are
  allowed to come and go frequently.  The overlay network needs
  not be precisely homomorphic to the underlying Internet
  topology.  But it does need to avoid network bottlenecks, and
  at the same time avoid excessive fan-out at individual nodes.
  These are tractable problems, but they are usually simply
  ignored.  The problems can be demonstrated by running a
  Gnutella client overnight on a consumer-level Internet
  connection; by morning your Internet connection will be
  saturated.
