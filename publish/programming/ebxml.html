<blockquote>    When one reads about ebXML, evocations of a story about blind
    men and elephants lurk in mind. ebXML is a big project with
    a lot of pieces; it is difficult to grasp how they all fit
    together.  This article provides an introduction to the
    overall picture of ebXML, then looks a bit more specifically
    at the representation of business processes which is an
    important starting point for ebXML implementations.
</blockquote><h3>WHAT IS ebXML?

</h3> <p>  It is difficult to get a handle on exactly what ebXML is--and
  on what it isn't.  On the one hand, ebXML seems to promise a
  grand unification of everything businesses do to communicate
  with each.  On the other hand, one could be forgiven for
  thinking that ebXML amounts to nothing more than a pious, but
  vacuous, declaration that existing standards are worth
  following.  As with every "next big thing," the truth lies
  somewhere in the middle.
</p>
<p>  Sorting out ebXML involves a few steps.  By way of background,
  let's look at where ebXML comes from, and who supports it.
  Perhaps the first thing we need in order to understand the
  details of ebXML is to digest an alphabet soup of new acronyms
  and other special terms.  With a collection of terms in mind,
  and a bit of background on where it comes from, we can start to
  make sense of how all the different processes in ebXML hold
  together.
</p>
<p>  After we've sorted out what ebXML does--at least in outline--in
  the beginning part of this paper, the last section will look in
  some more detail at the "Business Process Specification Schema"
  which makes up one of the most important elements of ebXML's
  underlying infrastructure.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Background</strong></p>
 <p>  ebXML is an initiative whose participants and endorsers consist
  of just about every big company and government standards body
  worldwide that you can think of.  Well, maybe not <em>every</em> one
  you can think of, but certainly hundreds of large companies and
  bodies. ebXML is not just endorsed by computer/technology
  companies as you might expect; the backers include a large
  number industrial, shipping, banking, and other general
  interests.  The direct sponsors of ebXML are OASIS
  (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
  Standards) and UN/CEFACT (United Nations Centre for Trade
  Facilitation and Electronic Business).  But lots of standards
  bodies have a finger in the pie, including NIST (National
  Institute of Standards and Technology) and W3C (World Wide Web
  Consortium).
</p>
<p>  A short characterization can be found on the ebXML.org homepage:
</p>
<blockquote>    ebXML is a set of specifications that together enable a
    modular electronic business framework.  The vision of ebXML
    is to enable a global electronic marketplace where
    enterprises of any size and in any geographical location can
    meet and conduct business with each other through the
    exchange of XML based messages.
</blockquote><p>  Or in other words, ebXML hopes to succeed EDI (official
  descriptions tend to emphasize learning from EDI rather than
  throwing it out).
</p>
<p>  With such a collection of supporters, it would seem that ebXML
  is destined to take over the world.  I tend to have a cynical
  attitude towards industry buzzwords and hype.  However, in the
  case of ebXML, I mostly expect it to live up to its billing as
  a global protocol for most business transactions within the
  next five years.  Still, I think the way that ebXML will
  succeed in becoming universal is as much by allowing the
  incorporation of more-and-more of what businesses do anyway
  into the specifications as it is by actually getting businesses
  to do business differently.  I'm not sure if my estimation is
  cynical or if it is encouragement at the openness of ebXML
  specifications; but the ebXML initiative is clearly holds
  an "embrace existing standards and methods" attitude.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Terms D'art</strong></p>
 <p>  There are a number of terms to keep in mind before we look at
  the whole "vision" of ebXML interactions:
</p>
<blockquote>    <em>ebXML Registry</em>:  A Registry is a central server that stores
    a variety of information needed to make ebXML work.  Among
    the information a Registry makes available in XML form are
    Business Process &amp; Information Meta Models, Core Library,
    Collaboration Protocol Profiles, Business Library.
    Basically, when a business wants to start an ebXML
    relationship with another business, they query a Registry in
    order to locate a suitable partner, including information
    about requiremenets for dealing with that partner.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>Business Processes</em>:  A Business Process is simply an
    activity that a business can engage in (and for which it
    would generally want one or more partners).  A Business
    Process is formally described by the Business Process
    Specification Schema (a W3C XML Schema and also a DTD), but
    may also be modeled in UML.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>CPP</em>:  Collaboration Protocol Profile.  A business that
    wishes to engage in ebXML transactions will file a CPP with a
    Registry.  The CPP will specify some Business Processes the
    business wishes to engage in, as well as some Business
    Service Interfaces it supports.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>Business Service Interface</em>:  The ways that a business is
    able to carry out the transactions needed in its Business
    Processes.  The kinds of Business Messages the business
    supports, and the protocols over which these messages might
    be carried.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>Business Messages</em>:  The actual information communicated as
    part of a business transaction.  A message will contain
    multiple layers.  At the outside layer, an actual
    communication protocol must be used (such as HTTP or SMTP).
    SOAP is an ebXML recommendation as an envelope for a message
    "payload."  Other layers may deal with encryption or
    authentication.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>Core Library</em>:  A set of standard "parts" that may be used
    in larger ebXML elements.  For example, Core Processes may be
    referenced by Business Processes.  The Core Library is
    contributed by the ebXML initiative itself, while larger
    elements may be contributed by specific industries or
    businesses.
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>CPA</em>:  Collaboration Protocol Agreement.  A contract, in
    essence, between two or more businesses which can be derived
    automatically from the CPP's of the respective companies.  If
    a CPP says "I <em>can</em> do X", a CPA says "<em>We</em> -will- do X
    together."
</blockquote><blockquote>    <em>SOAP</em>:  a W3C protocol for exchange of information in a
    distributed environment that was endorsed by the ebXML
    initiative.  Of interest for ebXML is its function as an
    envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a
    message and how to process it.
</blockquote><p>  There are more terms the fit into the whole system, but these
  ones make a good starting point.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Putting It Together</strong></p>
 <p>  An illustration used in the ebXML Technical Architecture
  Specification will probably go a long way towards sorting out
  what ebXML means for businesses.
</p>
<p>  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/ebXML1.gif" alt="A high level overview of the interaction of two companies">
</p>
<p>  The first thing Company A in the illustration will do is review
  the contents of an ebXML Registry, most especially the Core
  Library that may be downloaded or viewed there.  The Core
  Library (and maybe other registered Business Processes) will
  allow Company A to determine what is required for their own
  implementation of ebXML (and whether ebXML is appropriate to
  their business needs).
</p>
<p>  Based on a review of the information available from an ebXML
  Registry Company A can build or buy an ebXML implementation
  suitable for its anticipated ebXML transactions.  The hope of
  the ebXML initiative is that vendors will support all the
  elements of ebXML. At such time an "ebXML system" might be
  little more than a pre-packaged desktop application; or maybe
  more realistically, the "ebXML system" will at least be as
  manageable as something like a commercial database system
  (which still needs a DBA).  The illustration the ebXML
  initiative document gives suggests that the hypothetical
  Company B uses something like this pre-packaged application.
</p>
<p>  Either way, the next step along the way is for Company A to
  create and register a CPP with the Registry.  Company A might
  wish to contribute new Business Processes to the Registry, or
  simply reference available ones.  The CPP will contain the
  information necessary for a potential partner to determine
  the business roles Company A is interested in, and the sort of
  protocols they are willing to engage in for these roles.
</p>
<p>  Once Company A is registered, Company B can look at Company A's
  CPP, and determine that it is, in fact, compatible with Company
  B's CPP and requirements.  At that point, Company B should be
  able to negotiate automatically a CPA with Company A, based on
  the conformance of the CPP's plus agreement protocols given as
  ebXML standards or recommendations.
</p>
<p>  Finally, the two companies start carrying out actual
  transactions.  These transactions are likely to involve
  Business Messages conforming to further ebXML standards and
  recommendations.  At some point in all this, however, certain
  things in the "real world" are likely to happen also.  Goods
  might get shipped from one place to another, or services might
  be otherwise rendered.  But ebXML will have helped in agreeing
  to, monitoring, and verifying these "real world" activities.
  Of course, in our "information economy" a lot of what goes on
  might stay within the realm of ebXML; maybe everything within a
  particular business relationship.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">The Business Process Schema</strong></p>
 <p>  ebXML Business Processes may be modeled with the UN/CEFACT
  Modeling Methodology (UMM), which utilizes UML.  But such
  modeling is simply a recommendation, not a requirement.  In any
  case, since this article is targeted toward XML developers
  rather than to an OOD angle, it is more interesting herein to
  look at the how models are represented in XML documents
  conformant to the Business Process Specification DTD and XML
  Schema.  The DTD--which is named "ebXMLProcessSpecification-
  v1.00.dtd"--appears, at this time, to be the primary rule
  representation.  Both this DTD and a W3C XML Schema that is,
  presumably, semantically and syntactically compatible may be
  found in the EbXML_BPschema_1.0 recommendation.
</p>
<p>  ebXML process specifications have a root element
  <code>ProcessSpecification</code>.  A particular process specification
  may contain subnode references to other process specifications,
  as well as to document specifications and other information.
  The DTD declaration for <code>ProcessSpecification</code> provides an
  overview of the structure of a Business Process document:
</p>
<p><strong>ProcessSpecification DTD Declaration</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT ProcessSpecification
          (Documentation*,
          (Include* | DocumentSpecification* |
            ProcessSpecification* | Package |
            BinaryCollaboration | BusinessTransaction |
            MultiPartyCollaboration)*)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST ProcessSpecification
          name    ID    #REQUIRED
          version CDATA #REQUIRED
          uuid    CDATA #REQUIRED &gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  The attribute <code>uuid</code> is a globally unique identifier for a
  process specification; the <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> are specific to
  the model represented (the <code>name</code> should not collide with
  nested process specifications).
</p>
<p>  Within a process specification, a <code>Package</code> defines a set of
  collaborations, which may be either <code>MultiPartyCollaboration</code>
  elements or <code>BinaryCollaboration</code> elements.  Collaborations, in
  turn, contain a variety of roles for the parties.  An excerpt
  from the sample process specification contained in the
  EbXML_BPschema_1.0 recommendation is helpful in sorting out
  this structure:
</p>
<p><strong>A Package of Collborations</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;Package name="Ordering"&gt;
  &lt;!-- First the overall MultiParty Collaboration --&gt;
  &lt;MultiPartyCollaboration name="DropShip"&gt;
    &lt;BusinessPartnerRole name="Customer"&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="requestor"/&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="buyer"/&gt;
      &lt;Transition fromBusinessState="Catalog Request"
                  toBusinessState="Create Order"/&gt;
    &lt;/BusinessPartnerRole&gt;
    &lt;BusinessPartnerRole name="Retailer"&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="provider"/&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="seller"/&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="Creditor"/&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="buyer"/&gt;
      &lt;Performs authorizedRole="Payee"/&gt;
[...]
  &lt;BinaryCollaboration name="Request Catalog"&gt;
    &lt;AuthorizedRole name="requestor"/&gt;
    &lt;AuthorizedRole name="provider"/&gt;
    &lt;BusinessTransactionActivity name="Catalog Request"
                                 businessTransaction="Catalog Request"
                                 fromAuthorizedRole="requestor"
                                 toAuthorizedRole="provider"/&gt;
  &lt;/BinaryCollaboration&gt;
[...]

<p><strong class="subhead">Conclusion</strong></p>
 <p>  The approval of ebXML specifications is moving along at a
  fairly rapid pace; certainly by the standards of standards
  organizations.  My own estimation is that it will take another
  year or two to shake out all the issues and details with such
  an ambitious vision.  But it appears that ebXML is on the way
  to widespread use a few years down the road; and therefore now
  is the time for businesses to begin a serious consideration
  of their ebXML implementation plans.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Resources</strong></p>
 <p>  The sponsors of ebXML can be found at:
</p>
<blockquote>    UN/CEFACT <em></em><a href="http://www.unece.org/cefact/">http://www.unece.org/cefact/</a>
</blockquote><blockquote>    OASIS <em></em><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">http://www.oasis-open.org</a>
</blockquote><p>  A number of specifications have been produced by the ebXML
  initiative.  All of these specifications can be found at
 <a href="http://ebxml.org.">http://ebxml.org.</a>  As specifications proceed through their
  approval process, their exact URLs will change, so it is best
  simply to navigate via the ebXML homepage.  If later versions
  of the documents mentioned here are produced, it will obviously
  make sense to refer to those superceding versions.
