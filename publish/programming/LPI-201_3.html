<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Understanding Filesystems", the third of eight tutorials
  designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial you will
  learn the steps a Linux system goes through during system
  initialization, and how to modify and customize those behaviors for
  you specific needs.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About filesystems
</h3>
 <p>
  This tutorial addresses both elements of Linux strictly speaking and
  also external tools that are merely useful for working with Linux
  systems. Support for filesystems, devices and partitions is either
  compiled into the base kernel or included in kernel modules. So that
  aspect is a Linux kernel matter, as such. However, various tools that
  you are likely to use in managing these filesystems recognized by
  Linux are userland utilities, and hence merely commonly included with
  Linux distributions rather than part of Linux itself. Nonetheless,
  filesystem tools are essential for working with pretty much every
  Linux system, regardless of its intended use (even non-networked or
  embedded systems).
</p>
<h3>Creating Filesystems</h3>
 <h3>Creating partitions (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  Before you can work with Linux filesystems, you need to create them.
  But before you can create a filesystem, you need to create a partition
  to put it on. As a brief primer, on x86 machines, hard disks may be
  divided into four primary partitions, but the last of those primary
  partitions may contain a number of extended partitions inside it. In
  the past there were a number of restrictions about the highest
  cylinders where bootable partitions can occur, maximum disk sizes,
  where primary partitions could be located on large disks, and so on.
  However, for the last five years or more, pretty much all system
  bios's flexibly handle disks of essentially unlimited size, and modern
  bootloaders (at least for Linux), have no important restrictions
  about paritition sizes or locations.
</p>
<p>
  About the only rule that remains to worry about nowadays concerns
  operating systems other than Linux.  Sometimes those still insist on
  living in primary partititions near the front of a hard disk.  Linux
  parititions are more than happy to reside on extended partitions, and
  anywhere on any accessible disk drive.
</p>
<h3>Creating partitions (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  There are several widely used tools in the Linux world for creating
  and manipulating partitions on harddisks.  The oldest such tool is
  <code>fdisk</code>.  Somewhat later the <code>curses</code>-based <code>cfdisk</code> has become
  popular.  GNU <code>parted</code> is also used in many distributions.  As well,
  the installation systems for most Linux distributions and/or their
  graphical environments come with partititioning front-ends that
  provide friendlier interfaces to viewing and modifying partititions.
</p>
<p>
  Of these tools, <code>fdisk</code> seems to remain the most flexible and most
  forgiving tool.  Forgiving, however, is a slightly odd term to use
  here.  Writing unintended partition table information is a recipe for
  disaster regardless of what tool you use.  But if your partitions have
  been created in somewhat non-standard ways, often by non-Linux
  operating systems and tools, <code>fdisk</code> will generally trudge through
  where other tools might refuse to try at all.  If it works, however,
  <code>cfdisk</code> is generally friendlier and more interactive.  And <code>parted</code>
  provides more powerful options about resizing and moving existing
  partitions non-destructively than will <code>fdisk</code> or <code>cfdisk</code>.
</p>
<h3>Creating partitions (part three)
</h3>
 <p>
  Whatever tool you use to create partitions, the concepts are similar.
  First thing is that you need to perform these sort of opertions as
  root, and ideally in single-user mode. And it's hard to make this
  point too strongly: <strong>be careful</strong> when you modify partitions (ideally,
  have all important data backed up, as well as paying careful attention
  to what changes you make).
</p>
<p>
  Before you start modifying a partitition table, it is a good idea to
  be clear about what partitions currently exist.  The command
  <code>fdisk -l /dev/hda</code> (or similar for other disks, e.g. <code>/dev/hdb</code> or
  <code>/dev/sda</code>) gives you information on existing partitions.  <code>mount</code> is
  also helpful in helping understand how these existing paritions are
  acutally being used.  If you wish to create new partitions, keep
  particularly in mind any extra sectors within the fourth primary
  partition that might be available for additional extended partitions.
</p>
<h3>Creating partitions (part four)
</h3>
 <p>
  Let us see an example of a partition table on a Linux system of mine:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% fdisk -l /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders

   Device Boot   Start      End      Blocks     Id  System
/dev/sda1   *        1     1216     9767488+     7  HPFS/NTFS
/dev/sda3         1217     4255    24410767+    83  Linux
/dev/sda4         4256     9729    43969905      5  Extended
/dev/sda5         4256     4380     1004031     82  Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/sda6         4381     5597     9775521     83  Linux

</pre></div><p>
  This tells us several things.  First of all, we can see that partition
  one is probably used by a foriegn operating system.  And running
  <code>mount</code> will let us know:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mount | head -1
/dev/sda3 on / type reiserfs (rw,noatime,notail,commit=600)

</pre></div><p>
  That is, the existing system is rooted on <code>/dev/sda3</code>.  Of most
  interest, perhaps, is that the <code>/dev/sda4</code> parition extends to
  cylinder 9729, but the extended paritions within it use only part of
  that space.
</p>
<h3>Creating partitions (part four)
</h3>
 <p>
  In the last panel, we discovered some free space available on a drive.
  Let us create a partition within it using <code>fdisk</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% fdisk /dev/sda
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9726
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cuase problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting ant partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

Command (m for help): n
Command action
   l   logical (5 or over)
   p   primary partition (1-4)
l
First cylinder (5598-9729), default 5598):
Using default value 5598
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (5598-9729, default 9729): +10000M

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

</pre></div><p>
  Everything that follows a colon is typed in by the user (you). At this
  point, we have created a new 10GB Linux partition, i.e.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>/dev/sda7         5598     6814     9775521     83  Linux

</pre></div><p>
  Keep reading to find out how to <strong>use</strong> this partition.  Note that you
  may need to reboot a system to make new paritions accessible.
</p>
<h3>Making a filesystem in a partition (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  Just having a partition is not quite enough to use a filesystem. In
  the prior panel we created a new Linux parition at <code>/dev/sda7</code>. But we
  still have not yet decided which of the many filesystems Linux
  supports to use within that parition. Do we want the historical
  default <code>ext2</code>? Or the newer journaling-enhanced extension <code>ext3</code>
  format? Maybe we want one of the enhanced filesystems contributed to
  Linux by other parties, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS.  Or maybe we need a
  filesystem to interoperate with another operating system, such as
  Minix, MSDOS, of VFAT (some others can be read if created already, but
  not always created with Linux tools).
</p>
<p>
  All of the tools for making new filesystems are names as <code>mkfs.*</code>.
  That is, your system might have <code>mkfs.ext2</code>, <code>mkfs.minix</code>, <code>mkfs.xfx</code>,
  and so on, usually installed in <code>/sbin/</code>.  As well, you may access
  each of these using the basic <code>mkfs -t &lt;fstype&gt;</code> switch.  Several, but
  not all, of the filesystems also have compact forms as, e.g. <code>mke3fs</code>.
  Exactly which filesystems are available depends on your specific Linux
  distribution and version, as well as what extra tools you might have
  installed.  <code>mkfs.ext2</code> is almost certainly available on nearly every
  distribution.
</p>
<h3>Making a filesystem in a partition (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  The basics of creating a filesystem are quite simple.  Just run your
  desired <code>mkfs.*</code> tool against the partition you want the filesystem to
  exist on.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mkfs.xfs /dev/sda7

</pre></div><p>
  The messages you will see will vary somewhat depending on which
  filesystem type you used.  Generally, the displayed information
  provides you information on the number of inodes, blocks, journaling
  type (if any), extents, fragments, as is relevant to that particular
  filesytem's usage strategy.  Many of the filesystem creation tools
  will warn you if you try to create a new filesystem on a partition
  with an existing filesystem; but not all of them will, so proceed with
  great caution (creating a new filesystem over an old one will probably
  result in data loss).
</p>
<h3>Making an ISO filesystem (mkisofs)
</h3>
 <p>
  A special case of making a filesystem is the creation of an ISO
  filesystem, that is, a system image that may be written to a writeable
  CD or DVD device.  An ISO filesystem is special in the sense that it
  is really just a (large) file that has data layed out in a certain
  way, rather than an arrangement of a raw device like <code>/dev/cdrom</code> or
  <code>/dev/hdb3</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The basic idea of creating an ISO filesystem--which really means
  either an ISO9660 or HFS hybrid volume--is simply to take the files in
  one or more existing hierarchies and arrange them into an ISO image.
  ISO9660 itself is limited to simple DOS-style 8.3 names, but the Rock
  Ridge and Joliet extensions allow storage of longer names and/or
  additional file attributes.  For example, to create an image of a
  project, you might use a command like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mkisofs -o ProjectCD.iso -r ~/project-files ~/project-extras

</pre></div><p>
  In this case, we create an ISO image that uses Rock Ridge attributes
  (but unlike <code>-R</code> sets more useful values, such as all files readable),
  and contains a merge of all the files in two directories.  Other
  options would let us add bootable headers to the image, create an HFS
  image, attach directories in specified locations other than root, and
  fine tune file options.
</p>
<h3>Making an ISO filesystem (cdrecord)
</h3>
 <p>
  Transferring an ISO image to a recordable CD or DVD is often
  accomplished nowadays using a frontend tool, often a GUI interface.
  For example, both Gnome and KDE make CD burning part of their file
  manager interface. Some commercial tools exist also. But for an system
  administrator, the older command-line tool <code>cdrecord</code> is a trusted
  utility that is present on most modern distributions, and is much
  closer to "standard" than are other front-ends.  Generally, the basic
  usage just requires specifying the device you want to write to, and
  the ISO file you want to write.
</p>
<p>
  As usual with Linux utilities, you may also specify a number of
  options to the record process, such as <code>-overburn</code> for CD's larger
  than 650 MB, or a specific burn speed for your writer.  See the
  manpage for <code>cdrecord</code> for current details.
</p>
<h3>Making an ISO filesystem (cdrecord, part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  Finding the device may be accomplished with the <code>-scanbus</code> option. The
  device you want is named as a numeric triple indicating the bus, not a
  regular block device in the filesystem. For example, you might see
  something like (abridged):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cdrecord -scanbus
[...]
scsibus0:
     0,0,0     0) 'ATA     ' 'WDC WD800UE-00HC' '09.0' Disk
     0,1,0     1) *
     [...]
scsibus1:
     1,0,0   100) 'Slimtype' 'DVDRW SOSW-852S ' 'PSB2' Removable CD-ROM
     [...]

</pre></div><p>
  With bus information in hand, you might burn an image thus:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% sudo cdrecord -overburn -v speed=16 dev=1,0,0
   /media/KNOPPIX_V3.6-2004-08-16-EN.iso

</pre></div><p>
  In this case, my image is oversized, and I know my burner supports
  16x.  The action command output is rather verbose because of the <code>-v</code>
  option, but that helps in understanding the whole process.
</p>
<h3>Making an ISO filesystem (dd)
</h3>
 <p>
  Of final note (about ISO images), sometimes you want to
  create a brand new ISO image not out of some directories in your main
  filesystem, but rather from an already existing CD or DVD.  To make an
  ISO image from a CD, just use the command <code>dd</code>, but refer to the raw
  block device for the CD rather than to the mounted location.  For
  example,
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% dd if=/dev/cdrom of=project-cd.iso

</pre></div><p>
  An active reader might wonder why not just use <code>cp</code> if the goal is to
  copy bytes.  Actually, if you ignore a reported I/O error when the raw
  device runs out of bytes to copy, the <code>cp</code> command is <strong>likely</strong> to
  work.  However, <code>dd</code> is better style (and doesn't complain at, but
  instead report a summary of activity).
</p>
<h3>Operating The Linux Filesystem</h3>
 <h3>mount and umount
</h3>
 <p>
  A flexible feature of Linux systems is the fine tuned control you have
  over mounting and unmounting filesystems. Unlike under Windows and
  some other operating systems, partitions are not automatically
  assigned locations by the Linux kernel, but are instead attached to
  the single <code>/</code> root hierarchy by the <code>mount</code> command. Moreover,
  different filesystems types (on different drives, even) may be mounted
  within the same hierarchy. Unmounting a particular partition is done
  with the <code>umount</code> command, specifying either the mount point (e.g.
  <code>/home</code>) or the raw device (e.g. <code>/dev/hda7</code>).
</p>
<p>
  For recovery purposes, the ability to control mount points lets you
  perform forensic analysis on partitions--using <code>fsck</code> or other
  tools--without risking further damage to a damaged filesystem. You may
  also custom mount a filesystem using various options; the most
  important of these is mounting read-only using either of the synonyms
  <code>-r</code> or <code>-o ro</code>.
</p>
<p>
  As a quick example, you might wish to substitute one user directory
  location for another, either because of damage to one, or simply to
  expand disk space or move to a faster disk.  You might perform this
  switch using something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># umount /home      # old /dev/hda7 home dir
# mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 /home  # new SCSI disk using XFS
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda2 /tmp  # also put the /tmp on SCSI

</pre></div><h3>Default mounting
</h3>
 <p>
  For day-to-day operation, you generally want a pretty fixed set of
  mounts to happen at every system boot. You control the mounts that
  happen at bootup by putting configuration lines in the file
  <code>/etc/fstab</code>. A typical configuration might look something like the
  below example.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># &lt;file system&gt; &lt;mount point&gt;   &lt;type&gt;  &lt;options&gt;       &lt;dump&gt;  &lt;pass&gt;
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/sda3       /               reiserfs notail         0       1
/dev/sda5       none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/sda6       /home           ext3    rw              0       2
/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 ro,user,noauto  0       0
/media/Ubuntu-5.04-install-i386.iso /media/Ubuntu_5.04 iso9660 rw,loop 0 0

</pre></div><p>
  Some brief explanation of the fields is helpful.  The first field
  listed is (normally) the block device to mount.  The second field is
  the mounted location.  In some special cases, something other than a
  block device is given first.  For <code>supermount</code> devices, you will see
  <code>none</code>.  <code>/proc</code> is another odd case.  You might also mount loopback
  devices, which are usually regular files.
</p>
<p>
  Type and options (3rd and 4th fields) are fairly straightforward
  (options depend on filesystem type and usage). Dump (5th field) is
  usually zero. Pass (6th field) should be 1 for the root filesystem,
  and 2 for other filesystems that should be 'fsck'ed during system
  boot.
</p>
<h3>Automounting (AMD and automount)
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux has quite a few different ways of automatically mounting media
  that is removable (e.g. floppies, CDs, USB drives) or otherwise not of
  fixed availability (e.g. such as NFS filesystems). The goal of all
  these tools is similar, but each works slightly differently.
</p>
<p>
  The tool AMD (automount daemon) is somewhat older, and operates in
  userland. Basically, AMD runs periodically to see if any new mountable
  filesystems have become available, generally for NFS filesystems. For
  the most part, AMD has been replaced in Linux distributions by
  Autofs, which runs as a kernel process.
</p>
<p>
  You setup Autofs firstly by compiling it into the kernel you use.
  After that, the behavior of the autofs daemon (usually
  <code>/etc/init.d/autofs</code>) is controlled by the file <code>/etc/auto.master</code>,
  which in turn references a map file. For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># Sample auto.master file
# Format of this file: mountpoint map options
/mnt    /etc/auto.mnt  --timeout=10

</pre></div><p>
  The referenced <code>/etc/auto.mnt</code> specifies one or more subdirectories
  of <code>/mnt</code> that will be mounted (if access is requested).  Unmounting
  will occur automatically, in this case 10 seconds after last access.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># Sample /etc/auto.mnt
floppy  -fstype=auto,rw,sync,umask=002  :/dev/fd0
cdrom   -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev :/dev/cdrom
remote  -fstype=nfs     example.com:/some/dir

</pre></div><h3>Automounting (supermount and submount)
</h3>
 <p>
  The tools <code>supermount</code> and <code>submount</code> are kernel-level tools (either
  compiled into the base kernel or kernel modules) to automatically
  mount removable media when accessed. Submount is somewhat newer, but
  Supermount is still probably used in more distributions. Neither tool
  is useful for NFS remote mounts, but either is more seamless than
  Autofs for local media.
</p>
<p>
  In either case, devices requiring automounting are generally listed in
  the <code>/etc/fstab</code> configuration.  The tools use slightly different
  syntaxes in <code>/etc/fstab</code> but both are straightforward.  A supermount
  enabled <code>/etc/fstab</code> might contain, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># Example of supermount in /etc/fstab
none  /mnt/cdrom  supermount  fs=auto,dev=/dev/cdrom  0 0
none  /mnt/floppy supermount  fs=auto,dev=/dev/fd0,--,user,rw  0 0

</pre></div><p>
  Submount specifies the block device in the regular location rather
  than as a mount option.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>/dev/cdrom  /mnt/cdrom  subfs fs=cdfss,ro,users       0 0
/dev/fd0    /mnt/floppy subfs fs=floppyfss,rw,users   0 0

</pre></div><h3>What is currently mounted?
</h3>
 <p>
  An Linux user actually has several ways to see a list of current
  mounts.  The <code>mount</code> command with no options (or with the <code>-l</code> option)
  lists currently mounted paths.  If you like, you can filter the
  results with the <code>-t fstype</code> option.
</p>
<p>
  The underlying dynamic information on mounted filesystems lives in
  <code>/etc/mtab</code>.  The <code>mount</code> and <code>umount</code> commands, and other systems
  processes, will update this file to reflect current status; you should
  treat this file as read-only.  A subset of the mount status
  information is additionally contained in <code>/proc/mounts</code>.
</p>
<h3>Maintaining A Linux Filesystem</h3>
 <h3>fsck
</h3>
 <p>
  Your best friend in repairing a broken filesystem is <code>fsck</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The tool called <code>fsck</code> is actually just a frontend for a number of
  more narrow <code>fsck.*</code> tools, such as <code>fsck.ext2</code>, <code>fsck.ext3</code> or
  <code>fsck.reiser</code>.  You may specify the type explicitly using the <code>-t</code>
  option, but <code>fsck</code> will make an effort to figure it out on its own.
  Read the manpage for <code>fsck</code> or <code>fsck.*</code> for more details.  The main
  think you want to know is that the <code>-a</code> option will try to fix
  everything it can automatically.
</p>
<p>
  You can check an unmounted filesystem by mentioning its raw device.
  For example: <code>fsck /dev/hda8</code> to check a partition not in use.  You
  can also check a rooted filesystem, such as <code>fsck /home</code>; but
  generally you only want to do that if the filesystem is already
  mounted as read-only, not as read-write.
</p>
<h3>badblocks
</h3>
 <p>
  A lower-level test of the quality of a block device (i.e. partition)
  than <code>fsck</code> is performed by <code>badblocks</code>. This utility
  may--destructively or non-destructively--examine the reliability of
  blocks on a device by writing and reading test patterns. The default
  option is <code>-n</code> for a slower mode that preserves existing data. For a
  brand new partition with no existing files, you can (and probably
  should) use the <code>-w</code>.  This tool simply informs you of bad blocks, it
  does not repair or mark them.
</p>
<p>
  However, in practice, you are usually better off using the badblock
  checking wrapper in the <code>fsck.*</code> tool for your filesystem.  For
  example, <code>e2fsck</code> (also called <code>fsck.ext2</code>) has the option <code>-c</code> to
  find and mark badblocks that the <code>badblocks</code> tool can detect.
  ReiserFS has similar <code>--check</code> and <code>--badblocks</code> options (but is not
  quite as automatic).  Read the documentation for your particular
  filesystem type for details on wrappers to <code>badblocks</code>.
</p>
<h3>Other maintenance utilities
</h3>
 <p>
  A number of tool are available for examining and fine-tuning Linux
  filesystems.  In normal usage, the default settings for file systems
  are well designed, but occassionally you will want to use filesystem
  tools for forensic analysis on crashed systems or to tune performance
  on systems with well-defined usage patterns.  Each filesystem type has
  its own set of tools; check the documentation for the filesystem you
  use for more details, but the most have a similar array of tools.
  Some examples include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> dumpe2fs: output information about an ext2/3 filesystem.
  </strong> tune2fs: adjust filesystem parameters on ext2/3 filesystems.
  <strong> debugfs: interactively fine-tune and examine an ext2/3 filesystem.
  </strong> reiserfstune: adjust filesystem parameters on Reiser filesystems.
  <strong> debugreiserfs: output information about a Reiser filesystem.
  </strong> xfs_admin: adjust filesystem parameters of an XFS filesystem
</p>
<h3>Special tools
</h3>
 <p>
  The tool <code>sync</code> forces changed unwritten blocks to disk.  You should
  not need to use this in normal situations, but you can sometimes check
  for disk problems by checking for a non-zero exit status.  Modern
  filesystems, particularly journalling filesystems like ext3, Reiser,
  or JFS, effectively do syncing on every write.

  If you like, you can manually disable or enable the use of a swapping,
  or enable/disable swapping for particular devices.  Normally, every
  device marked as type <code>swap</code> in <code>/etc/fstab</code> is used for swapping.
