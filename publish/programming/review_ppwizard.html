<p><strong class="subhead">What Is Ppwizard?</strong></p>
 <p>  PPWizard is a text "preprocessor" written in REXX.  A special
  emphasis is made by PPWizard to process for HTML output (lots
  of handy HTML-related functions come with it); but strictly
  speaking you can use PPWizard for most any output format.
</p>
<p>  A preprocessor is a great thing to use when you want to
  generate a site worth of consistent-looking pages.  Rather than
  having to copy-and-paste things like navigation bars,
  site-titles, color and background definitions, with a
  preprocessor you can give a simple name to a whole bunch of
  HTML; and changing it in one place will change it everywhere.
</p>
<p>  What a preprocessor actually does is read a source file that
  consists of some literal text with some directives, and create
  output according to the directives.  In the case of PPWizard,
  the directives can range from some predefined high-level macros
  to your own embedded code.
</p>
<p>  PPWizard is probably the most powerful and well designed
  preprocessor you can get.  And like so much good software, it's
  free.  PPWizard is not a tool that completely holds your hand:
  you need to remember some macro names and keep in mind what you
  are doing.  But anyone who has written a little program code,
  or even hand-coded HTML, should have no trouble with the
  skill-level needed by PPWizard.  Quite a bit can be done with
  PPWizard's predefined macros; and for those requiring more,
  there is room to grow by programming directives in actual REXX
  (it is an easy language to work with).  One can even process
  HTML pages based on database queries, or on the results of
  other programs you might use.
</p>
<p>  A word on REXX:  Users of IBM operating systems (plus AmigaOS)
  will be familiar with the REXX scripting language that comes
  with their OS.  For other developers, however, a free REXX
  interpreter is available called <code>Regina</code>; Regina can be found
  at<a href="http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/Regina/index.html.">http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/Regina/index.html.</a>
  Precompiled binaries can be downloaded for most common
  operating systems (even, for example, BeOS and QNX), and source
  code is available for any others.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Ppwizard Versus Server-side Includes</strong></p>
 <p>  Apache's server-side includes (SSI) are a handy tool for
  including common-content across a number of web-pages (often
  for site consistency).  PPWizard is much like a greatly
  enhanced SSI mechanism.  In much the same style as SSI, a
  PPWizard source file is a bunch of instructions about what to
  include in a given web page.  But PPWizard goes a lot farther
  than SSI does.  You can include content conditionally on a
  calculation or another program step (are certain files in a
  directory, what's the date, how does an SQL query do, etc); you
  can write values into the file that depend on program steps,
  rather than just another file's contents; you can generate a
  whole site worth of files rather than just the one being
  delivered.
</p>
<p>  The site issue draws another contrast.  PPWizard is primarily
  useful as a batch tool for regenerating a site.  It is not
  firstly designed for dynamic page delivery.  You might generate
  a PPWizard site every night--as a cron job, for example--but if
  your site content changes from minute to minute, PPWizard is
  not really the best tool.  You <strong>could</strong> install PPWizard on your
  server, and create a wrapper for generation of pages by
  PPWizard.  That would not be hard to do, but it is also not
  really the target usage of PPWizard:  REXX is not as fast as
  Perl or Python (let alone C), and there is nothing like
  mod_perl or mod_php to speed things up.  On the plus side, if
  you have a site that is the type you only need to change
  intermittently, batch processing with PPWizard avoids any extra
  server load imposed by SSI or CGI-like techniques.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Ppwizard Versus Server-side Scripting</strong></p>
 <p>  PPWizard is also comparable to server-side scripting tools like
  PHP or ASP.  REXX has a similar power and expressiveness to
  PHP, ColdFusion, or VBScript (but programmer tastes differ, of
  course).  PPWizard source files look less like "HTML files with
  extra bits" than they do like "Include files with bits of
  HTML."  But that is a small difference once you are used to one
  thing or another.  Both the pros and cons of batch versus dynamic
  are increased when thinking of server-side scripting (vs.
  SSI).  Scripts demand more server resources, but can also be
  more dynamic, than SSI.  PPWizard gives you the sophisticated
  processing of server-side scripts, but the batch mode reduces
  the server utilization to static-page requirements.
</p>
<p>  PPWizard arguably makes it easier to create consistent site
  features and appearance than one gets with PHP, mod_perl, ASP,
  ColdFusion, or the like.  PPWizard templates are flexible and
  can be nested hierarchically.  A change one place very easily
  propogates consistently.  PPWizard's source file structure puts
  a clear focus on the conditional and common elements of pages,
  and the files are easy to update and maintain.  Overall,
  PPWizard is the best tool the author has found for creating
  consistent, mostly-static sites.
