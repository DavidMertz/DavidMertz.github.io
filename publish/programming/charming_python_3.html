<blockquote>
    This article examines Txt2Html, a public-domain working
    project created by the author to illustrate Python
    programming techniques.  <code>Txt2Html</code> is a "web-based filtering
    proxy"--a program that reads web-based documents for the
    user, then presents a modified page to the user's browser.
    In order to accomplish these tasks, <code>Txt2Html</code> runs as a CGI
    program, queries outside web resources, and makes use of
    regular-expressions; each of these general-purpose sub-tasks
    is explained, clarified, and demonstrated in this article.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and is highly portable between
  platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction To 'Txt2Html'</h3>
 <p>
  In the course of writing articles in this series, the author
  faced a quandry about the best format to write in.
  Wordprocessor formats are proprietary, and conversions between
  formats tend to be imperfect and troublesome (and they bind
  one to proprietary tools; contrary to an open-source spirit).
  HTML is fairly neutral--and is probably the form you are
  reading this article in--but it also adds tags that are easy to
  mistype (or commits one to an HTML-enhanced editor).  DocBook
  is an interesting XML format that can be converted to many
  target formats, and has the right semantics for technical
  articles (or books); but like HTML, there are lots of tags to
  worry about during the writing process.  LaTeX is great for
  sophisticated typography; but lots of tags again, and these
  articles don't need typographic sophistication.
</p>
<p>
  For real ease of composition--and especially for platform and
  tool neutrality--plain ASCII just cannot be beat.  Beyond
  completely plain text, however, the internet (especially
  Usenet) has prompted the development of an informal standard of
  "smart ASCII" documents.  "Smart ASCII" adds just a little bit
  of extra semantic content and context in ways that look
  "natural" in text displays.  Emails, newsgroup posts, FAQs,
  project READMEs, and other electronic documents often include a
  few typographic/semantic elements like asterisks around
  emphasized words, underscores surrounding titles, vertical and
  horizontal whitespace to describe textual relations, selective
  ALLCAPS, and a few other tidbits.  Project Guttenburg is a
  wonderful effort that put quite a bit of thought into its own
  consideration of formats, and decided on "smart ASCII" as the
  best choice for preserving and distributng great books for a
  long time.  Even if these articles won't live as such literary
  classics, the decision was made to write them as "smart ASCII",
  and automate any conversions to other formats with handy Python
  scripts.
</p>
<p>
  <code>Txt2Html</code> started out as a simple file converter, as the name
  suggests.  But the internet posed several obvious enhancements
  to the tool.  Since many of the documents one might want to
  view in an "html-ized" form live somewhere at the end of
  http: or ftp: links, the tool should really handle such remote
  documents straightforwardly (without the need for a
  download/convert/view cycle).  And since the target of the
  conversion is HTML after all, what we would generally want to
  do with the target is view it in a web-browser.  Putting these
  things together, it emerged that <code>Txt2Html</code> should be a
  "web-based filtering proxy." Fancy words there, maybe even
  "fully buzzword compliant." What it amounts to is the idea that
  a program might read a web-page (or other resource) on your
  behalf, massage the contents in some way, then present you with
  something that is <strong>better</strong> than the original page (at least for
  some particular purpose).  A good example of such a tool is the
  Babelfish translation service.  After running a URL through
  Babelfish, you see a webpage that looks pretty much like the
  original one, but has the pleasant feature of having words in
  a language you can read instead of in a language you do not
  understand.  In a way, all the search-engines that present
  little synopses of the pages they find for a search do the same
  thing.  But those search-engines (by design) take a lot more
  liberty with the formatting and appearance of a target page,
  and leave out a lot more.  <code>Txt2Html</code> is certainly a lot less
  ambitious than Babelfish is; but conceptually, both do largely
  the same thing.  See the resources for some more examples, some
  rather humorous.
</p>
<p>
  Best of all, <code>Txt2Html</code> uses a number of programming techniques
  that are common to a lot of different web-oriented uses of
  Python.  This article will introduce those techniques, and give
  some pointers on coding techniques and the scope of some Python
  modules.  Note: the actual module in <code>Txt2Html</code> is called
  <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> to avoid conflict with the naming of a module
  written by someone else.
</p>
<h3>Using The <em><code>cgi</code></em> Module</h3>
 <p>
  Python's <em><code>cgi</code></em> module--in the standard distribution--is a
  godsend for anyone developing "Common Gateway Interface"
  applications in Python.  You could create CGI's without it, but
  you wouldn't want to.
</p>
<p>
  Most typically, one interacts with CGI applications by means of
  an HTML form.  One fills out some values in the form that
  specify details of the action to be performed, then call on the
  CGI to perform its action using your specifications.  For
  example, the <code>Txt2Html</code> documentation uses this example for a
  calling HTML form (the one generated by <code>Txt2Html</code> itself is a
  bit more complicated, and may change; but the example will work
  perfectly well, even from within your own web pages):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>HTML form to call 'Txt2Html'</h4><pre>
&lt;form method="get" action="http://gnosis.cx/cgi-bin/txt2html.cgi"&gt;
  URL: &lt;input type="text" name="source" size=40&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" name="go" value="Display!"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  You may include many input fields within an HTML form, and the
  fields can be of a number of different types (text, checkboxes,
  picklists, radio buttons, etc.).  Any good book on HTML can
  help a beginner with creating custom HTML forms.  The main
  thing to remember here is that each field has a <code>name</code>
  attribute, and that name is used later to refer to the field in
  our CGI script.  Another detail worth knowing about is that
  forms can have one of two <code>method</code> attributes: "get" and
  "post".  The basic difference is that the "get" method encodes
  all the details of how the form was filled out right into the
  URL generated (by including a bunch of "URL encoded" stuff
  after the URL indicated in the <code>action</code> attribute).  Using this
  method makes it easier for a user to save a specific query for
  later reuse.  Then again, if you do not want users to save
  queries, use the "post" method.
</p>
<p>
  The Python script that gets called by the above form does an
  <code>import cgi</code> to make sorting out its calling form easy.  One
  thing this module does is hide any details of the difference
  between "get" and "post" methods from the CGI script.  By the
  time the call is made, this is not a detail the CGI creator
  needs to worry about.  The main thing done by the CGI module is
  to treat all the fields in the calling HTML form in a
  dictionary-like fashion.  What you get is not <strong>quite</strong> a
  Python dictionary, but it is close enough to be easy to work
  with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using Python [cgi] module</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> cgi, sys
cfg_dict = {<FONT COLOR=#115511>'target'</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;STDOUT&gt;'</FONT>}
sys.stderr = sys.stdout
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> form.has_key(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>):
    cfg_dict[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>] = form[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>].value</PRE></div><p>
  There are a couple little details to notice in the above few
  lines.  One trick we do is to set <code>sys.stderr = sys.stdout</code>.
  By doing this, if our script encounters an untrapped error, the
  traceback will display back to the client browser.  This can
  save a lot of time in debugging a CGI application.  But it
  might not be what you want users to see (or it might, if they
  are likely to report problem details to you).  Next, we read
  the HTML form values into the dictionary-like <code>form</code> instance.
  Much like a true Python dictionary, <code>form</code> has a <code>.has_key()</code>
  method.  However, unlike a Python dictionary, to actually pull
  off the value within a key, we have to look at the <code>.value</code>
  attribute for the key.
</p>
<p>
  From here, we have everything in the HTML form in plain Python
  variables, and we can handle them as in any other Python
  program.
</p>
<h3>Using The <em><code>urllib</code></em> Module</h3>
 <p>
  Like most things Python, <em><code>urllib</code></em> makes a whole bunch of
  complicated things happen in an obvious and simple way.  The
  <code>urlopen()</code> function in <em><code>urllib</code></em> treats any remote
  resource--whether http:, ftp:, or even gopher:-- just like it
  was a local file.  Once you grab a remote (pseudo-)filehandle
  using <code>urlopen()</code>, you can do everything you would with the
  filehandle of a local (read-only) file:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using Python [urllib] module</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> urllib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> urlopen
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> string
source = cfg_dict[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>]
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> source == <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;STDIN&gt;'</FONT>:
    fhin = sys.stdin
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>:
        fhin = urlopen(source)
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT>:
        ErrReport(source+<FONT COLOR=#115511>' could not be opened!'</FONT>, cfg_dict)
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT>
doc = <FONT COLOR=#115511>''</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> line <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> fhin.readlines():   <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Need to normalize line endings!</FONT>
    doc = doc+string.rstrip(line)+<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\n'</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  One minor problem that this author has encountered is that
  depending on the end-of-line convention used on the platform
  that produced the resource and on your own platform, some odd
  things can happen to the resulting text (this appears to be a
  bug in <em><code>urllib</code></em>).  The cure for this problems is to perform
  the little <code>.readlines()</code> loop in the above code.  Doing this
  gives you a string that has the right end-of-line conventions
  for the platform you are running on, regardless of what the
  source resource looked like (within reason, presumably).
</p>
<h3>Using The <em><code>re</code></em> Module</h3>
 <p>
  There is certainly a lot more to regular expressions than can
  fit into this article.  A widely read reference book on the
  topic is listed under Resources.  The <em><code>re</code></em> module is fairly
  widely used in <code>Txt2Html</code> to identify various textual patterns
  in the source texts.  A moderately complex example is worth
  looking at.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using Python [re] module</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> re
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="URLify"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> URLify</B></FONT></A>(txt):
    txt = re.sub(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'((?:http|ftp|gopher|file)://(?:[^ \n\r&lt;\)]+))(\s)'</FONT>,
                 <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;a href="\\1"&gt;\\1&lt;/a&gt;\\2'</FONT>, txt)
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> txt</PRE></div><p>
  <code>URLify()</code> is a nice little function to do pretty much what it
  says.  If something that looks like a URL is encountered in the
  "smart ASCII" file, it is converted into an actual hotlink to
  that same URL within the HTML output.  Let us look at what the
  <code>re.sub()</code> is doing.  First, in broadest terms, the function's
  purpose is to "match what is in the first pattern, then replace
  it with the second pattern, using the third argument as the
  string to operate on." Good enough, not much different from
  <code>string.replace()</code> in those terms.
</p>
<p>
  The first pattern has several elements.  Notice the parentheses
  first:  the highest level consists of two pairs: a complicated
  bunch of stuff followed by <code>(\s)</code>.  Sets of parentheses match
  "subexpressions" that can potentially make up part of the
  replacement pattern.  The second subexpression, <code>(\s)</code> just
  means "match any whitespace character (and let us refer back to
  the particular type of whitespace it was).  So let's look at
  the first subexpression.
</p>
<p>
  Python regular expressions have a couple tricks of their own.
  One such trick is the <code>?:</code> operator at the beginning of a
  subexpression.  This means "match a subpattern, but don't
  include the match in the back-references." So let us examine
  the subexpression
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>((?:http|ftp|gopher|file)://(?:[^ \n\r&lt;\)]+))</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  First notice that this subexpression is itself composed of two
  child subexpressions, with some stuff in the middle that is not
  part of any child subexpression.  However, each of the children
  starts with <code>?:</code>, which means that they get matched, but don't
  count for reference purposes.  The first of these
  "non-reference" child subexpressions just says "match something
  that looks like <code>http</code> <strong>or</strong> that looks like <code>ftp</code> <strong>or</strong> ...".
  Next we get the short string <code>://</code> which means to match
  anything that looks exactly like it (simple, huh?). Finally, we
  get the second child subexpression, which other than the "don't
  refer" operator consists of some stuff in square brackets, and
  a plus sign.
</p>
<p>
  In regular expressions, square brackets just mean "match any
  character in the brackets." However, if the first character is
  a caret (^), the meaning is reversed, and it means "match
  anything <strong>not</strong> in the next characters."  So we are looking for
  stuff that is <strong>not</strong> a space, CR, LF, "&lt;" or ")" (notice also
  that characters that have special meaning to regular
  expressions can be "escaped" by having a "\" in front of them).
  The plus sign at the end means "match one or more of the last
  thing" (asterisk is for "zero or more", and question-mark is
  for "zero or one").
</p>
<p>
  This regular expression has a bunch to digest, but if you walk
  through it a few times, you can see that this is what a URL has
  to look like.
</p>
<p>
  Next is the replacement chunk.  This is simpler.  The parts
  that look like <code>\\1</code> and <code>\\2</code> (or <code>\\3</code>, <code>\\4</code>, etc., if we
  needed them) are those "back references" discussed.  They mean
  "the pattern matched by the first (second) subexpression of the
  match expression. All the rest of the stuff in the replacement
  chunk just is what it is: some characters that are easily
  recognized as HTML codes.  One little thing that is a bit
  subtle is that we bother to match <code>\\2</code>--which looking above is
  just a whitespace character.  One might ask, "why bother? why
  not just insert a space as a literal?" Fair question, and we do
  not really <strong>need</strong> to do what we did for HTML.  But
  aesthetically, it is better to let the HTML output stay as
  much as possible like the source text file was before our our
  HTML markup.  Particularly, let us keep the line-breaks as
  line-breaks, and spaces as spaces (and tabs as tabs).
