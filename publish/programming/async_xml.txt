XML ZONE TIP: Asynchronous SAX:
Simple API for XML as a Long-Running Event Processor

    Even though every abstract description of SAX prominently
    mentions that SAX is an event-driven interface, very few SAX
    applications really -use- SAX for event-driven programming.
    Instead, mostly SAX is just a way to save memory while
    extracting data from an XML document. However, over
    asynchronous channels--such as a socket the produces data
    over a long duration--SAX is a wonderfully light-weight
    programming technique for parsing incoming messages.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Usually you think of XML as a format for files. Parsing an XML
  file using SAX means opening the file, sequentially reading
  through it to find tags and contents, processing each occurrence,
  then closing the file when the parsing is done. But the XML
  specification applies just as well to asynchronous streams as it
  does to disk files. And since SAX is strictly unidirectional, it
  works great on streams.

  A stream can be a lot of things, in principle, but most of the
  time in Internet programming, we think of BSD sockets--an
  interface implemented on all modern operating systems. There is
  no reason, however, that the techniques in this tip could not
  also be used for a serial-port instrument connection, to monitor
  GUI events, or for similar long running and intermittent data
  streams.

  The basic idea this tip promotes is that XML is often an
  excellent choice for a wire protocol, and SAX is the most natural
  technique for coding client applications that utilize this
  protocol. While XML's verboseness can be a problem for monitoring
  a large volumes of data, for moderate streams of ongoing data,
  SAX (and XML itself) is a good choice for a communications API.

AN IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  What I wanted as a test case in this article was some sort of
  non-finite data stream provided by a remote host that is useful
  to a client. Since I maintain a website, an obvious example was a
  way of remotely monitoring hits to my site--they continue
  forever, at an irregular rate, and the total data bandwidth is
  moderate. It could be useful, or at least interesting, to let a
  utility on my home system keep track of hits to my web server.

  On my particular web server, log records are appended to a
  file, one per line, with mostly space-separated fields.  But
  some quoted fields have internal spaces, so parsing a line is a
  little bit complicated.  Now certainly, I -could- send these
  raw log lines directly to the client, as they are written.  But
  XML has several nice features that readers are familiar with:
  it is somewhat self-documenting, it allows variations in
  attribute order and whitespace, within limits a schema can be
  enhanced over time and maintain backward compatability.  And
  specifically for my application, I could arrange to monitor
  several web servers this same way, as long as each one
  transmitted its log data in a common XML format.

  My XML log server is a pretty basic socket application,
  written in Python (but a different language would be fine for
  server and/or client).  An abridged version looks like:

      #-------- Server application: weblog-xml.py --------------#
      from SocketServer import BaseRequestHandler, TCPServer
      from time import sleep
      import sys, socket
      # ...Define hit_tag template and log_fields() function...
      class WebLogHandler(BaseRequestHandler):
          def handle(self):
              print "Connected from", self.client_address
              self.request.sendall('<hits>')
              try:
                  while True:
                      for hit in LOG.readlines():
                          self.request.sendall(hit_tag % log_fields(hit))
                      sleep(5)
              except socket.error:
                  self.request.close()
              print "Disconnected from", self.client_address
      if __name__=='__main__':
          global LOG
          LOG = open('../access-log')
          LOG.seek(0, 2)     # Start at end of current access log
          srv = TCPServer(('',8888), WebLogHandler)
          srv.serve_forever()

  When a socket is opened, the document root element '<hits>' is
  sent immediately, followed by new logged hits, as they occur (but
  batched in 5 second blocks), with elements similar to:

      #--------------- Sample <hit> XML element ----------------#
      <hit
        ip="210.8.XX.XXX"
        timestamp="11/May/2003:01:47:53 -0500"
        request="GET /publish/programming/code_recognizer.gif HTTP/1.1"
        status="200"
        bytes="12718"
        referrer="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/neural_networks.htm"
        agent="Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"/>


THE SAX CLIENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In the server, I have not yet used SAX at all.  I just use
  string formatting to compose XML elements.  In the client
  application, SAX saves some work.  Here is my entire current
  client application:

      #---------- SAX-based log monitoring client.py ------------#
      #!/usr/bin/env python
      import socket
      import xml.sax
      from xml.sax.handler import ContentHandler
      class AsyncWebLog(ContentHandler):
          def startDocument(self):
              print "Connected to gnosis.cx server"
          def startElement(self, name, attrs):
              if (name=='hit' and attrs['status']=='200'
                              and attrs['referrer']!='-'):
                  print attrs['referrer'],"->",attrs['request'].split()[1]
      parser = xml.sax.make_parser()
      parser.setContentHandler(AsyncWebLog())
      sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
      sock.connect(('gnosis.cx', 8888))
      try:
          while 1:
              xml_data = sock.recv(8192)
              parser.feed(xml_data)
      finally:
          sock.close()

  Since the log records are already nicely formatted as XML,
  parsing their elements is essentially effortless.  All I need
  to do is define a content handler that has a '.startElement()'
  method; and do something desirable inside that method.  Just to
  be a little friendly, I also have the client acknowledge the
  connection with a message--the message is triggered by the root
  '<hits>' element sent by the sever.

  My '.startElement()' method makes a few decisions about what it
  wants to display.  I decide only to process elements named
  '<hit>'--perhaps an enhanced server will start sending
  other sorts of XML elements as messages as well; my client
  will happily ignore them without choking on the stream.
  Quite a few attributes are available, but I decided to focus
  just on the referrers to my pages.  The boolean algebra of
  checking various such attributes is demonstrated by my test for
  only successfully delivered pages with known referrers.  After
  that, I print a description to my client screen.  Obviously, a
  more elaborate client application could use a GUI to diplay
  this information, or otherwise manipulate and process the
  received data.

QUICK FINISH
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With my client and server running, every once in a while my
  local terminal updates with a list of a few surfers who have
  followed links to get to my website.  As long as I leave these
  processes running, I will get updates forever--the underlying
  XML "document" has no size limit.  Any application that is
  similar in the minimal respect of monitoring a long-lasting
  data stream can usefully--and easily--utilize the XML and SAX
  libraries already available with their favorite programming
  tools to achieve this purpose.
