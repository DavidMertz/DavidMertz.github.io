    The "buzz" about XML Schemas is that they are the next big
    technology to think about within the XML universe.
    Specifically, a widespread sentiment exists that Schemas will
    soon replace DTDs as the means of specifying XML document
    types.  In the author's opinion, much of the praise for XML
    Schemas is overstated, but XML Schemas are nonetheless an
    invaluable tool in an XML developer's arsenal.  This article
    tries to sort out just what is going on in the XML Schema
    world.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  Much of the point of using XML as a data representation format
  is the possibility of specifying structural requirements for
  documents: rules for exactly what types of content and
  subelements may occur within elements (and in what order,
  cardinality, etc).  In traditional SGML circles, document rules
  have been represented as DTD's--and indeed the formal
  specification of the <cite>W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation</cite> explicitly
  provides for DTD's.  However, there are some things that DTD's
  cannot accomplish that are fairly common constraints; the main
  limitation of DTD's is the poverty of their expression of data
  types (you can specify that an element must contain PCDATA, but
  not that it must contain, e.g., a nonNegativeInteger).  As a
  side matter, DTD's do not make the speficication of subelement
  cardinality easy (you can compactly specify "one or more" of a
  subelement, but specifying "between seven and twelve" is, while
  possible, excessively verbose, or even outright contorted).
</p>
<p>
  In answer to some of the limitations of DTD's, some XML users
  have called for alternative ways of specifying document rules.
  It has always been possible to programmatically examine
  conditions in XML documents, but being able to impose the more
  rigid standard that a document not meeting a set of formal
  rules is <em>invalid</em> per se is often preferable.  W3C XML Schemas
  are one major answer to these calls (but not the only Schema
  option out there).  Steven Holzner, in <cite>Inside XML</cite> has a
  characterization of XML Schemas that is worth repeating:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Over time, many people have complained to the W3C about the
    complexity of DTDs and have asked for something simpler.  W3C
    listened, assigned a committee to work on the problem, and
    came up with a solution that is much more complex than DTDs
    ever were (p.199)
</blockquote>
<p>
  Holzner continues--and most all XML programmers will agree
  (myself included)--that despite their complexity, W3C XML
  Schemas provide a lot of important capabilities, and are worth
  using for many classes of validation rules.
</p>
<p>
  At least two wrinkles remain for any "Schemas everywhere" goal.
  That is, two fundamental and conceptual issues;  at a more
  pragmatic level, tools for working with XML Schemas are less
  mature than those for working with DTD's (especially in regard
  to validation, which is the core issue).  The first issue is
  that the <cite>W3C XML Schema Candidate Recommendation</cite> which just
  ended its review period on December 15, 2000 does not include
  any provision for entitites; by extension this includes
  parametric entities.  The second issue is that despite their
  enhanced expressiveness, there are still many document rules
  that cannot be expressed in XML Schemas (some proposals have
  been made to utilize XSLT to enhance validation expressiveness,
  but other means are possible and utilized also).  In other
  words, Schemas cannot quite do everything DTD's have long been
  able to, on the one hand, while on the other hand, Schemas also
  cannot express a whole set of further rules one might wish to
  impose on documents.
</p>
<p>
  The whole state of XML document validation rules remains messy.
  Unfortunately, I am not able to prognosticate how everything
  will finally shake out.  But in the meanwhile, let us look at
  some specifics of what DTD's and XML Schemas are capable of
  expressing.
</p>
<h3>Rich Typing</h3>
 <p>
  The place where W3C XML Schemas really shine is in expressing
  type constraints on attribute values and element contents.
  This is where DTD's are weakest.  Beyond providing an extremely
  rich set of built-in <em>simpleType</em>'s, XML Schemas allow you to
  derive new <em>simpleType</em>'s using a regular-expression-like
  syntax.  The built-ins include those you would expect if you
  have worked with programming languages: <em>string</em>, <em>int</em>,
  <em>float</em>, <em>unsignedLong</em>, <em>byte</em>, etc; but they also include
  some types most programming languages lack natively
  <em>timeInstant</em> (i.e. date/time), <em>recurringDate</em> (day-of-year),
  <em>uriReference</em>, <em>language</em>, <em>nonNegativeInteger</em>.  For example,
  in a DTD one might have a declaration like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>DTD "item" Element Definition</h4><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT item (prodName+,USPrice,shipDate?)
&lt;!ATTLIST item partNum CDATA&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT prodName (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT USPrice (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT shipDate (#PCDATA)&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  In W3C XML Schema, one can be more specific (modified slightly
  from the W3C Schema primer):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML Schema "item" Element Definition</h4><pre>
&lt;xsd:element name="item"&gt;
   &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
         &lt;xsd:element name="prodName" type="xsd:string" maxOccurs="5"/&gt;
         &lt;xsd:element name="USPrice"  type="xsd:decimal"/&gt;
         &lt;xsd:element name="shipDate" type="xsd:date" minOccurs="0"/&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xsd:attribute name="partNum" type="SKU"/&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;

&lt;!-- Stock Keeping Unit, a code for identifying products --&gt;
&lt;xsd:simpleType name="SKU"&gt;
   &lt;xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"&gt;
      &lt;xsd:pattern value="\d{3}-[A-Z]{2}"/&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Two striking, if superficial, features stand out in these
  element definitions.  One is that the Schema is itself a
  well-formed XML instance with its tags using the "xsd"
  namespace (actually, so is the DTD, but it has only processing
  instructions, no content as such); the second (and consequence
  of the first) is that the Schema is far more verbose than the
  DTD.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the syntactic niceties, we can see that the Schema
  example does several things that are imposible with DTD's.  The
  type of "prodName" is basically the same between the
  definitions.  But "USPrice" and "shipDate" are specified in the
  Schema as types <em>decimal</em> and <em>date</em>.  Considered as a text
  file, an XML instance with these elements contains some ASCII
  (or Unicode) characters inside the elements.  But a validator
  that is Schema-aware can demand much more specific formatting
  of the characters inside <em>decimal</em> and <em>date</em> elements (and
  likewise other types).  Much more interesting is the attribute
  "partNum" which is of a derived specialized type.  The type
  <em>SKU</em> is not a built-in type, but rather a sequence of
  characters following the pattern given in the "SKU"
  declaration (specifically, it must have three digits, a dash,
  and two capital letters, in that order).  <em>SKU</em> could also be
  used for an element type, it is just coincidence that it
  defines an attribute in this case.
</p>
<p>
  In the DTD version of our element definition, all these
  interesting (and potentially rather complicated, if
  specialized) types must simply get called <em>PCDATA</em>, with no
  further say as to what that character data looks like (<em>CDATA</em> in
  the case of attributes).
</p>
<p>
  In richly typing element/attribute values, Schemas shade subtly
  from describing the syntax of an XML instance to describing its
  semantics.  Parsing purists might take issue with my
  characterization: built-in Schema types are defined
  syntactically, and patterns built on those built-in are thusly
  also formally syntactic.  But in practical terms, when we
  declare that a given element must be a <em>date</em>, what we really
  want is...well...for the element to contain a date.  Expressing
  semantic information is not a bad thing, of course; but one
  might argue that that is better confined to an application
  level as such, rather than a format declaration.  After all,
  there are semantic features--even simple ones--that elude
  Schemas but might be just as important in an application as
  what Schemas express.  For example, sure a "stock keeping
  unit" must look like "999-AA"; but maybe also widgets are
  shipped out only in baker's dozens: divisibility on an
  <em>integer</em> by 13 is not expressible in XML Schemas (and
  therefore <em>widgetquantity</em> still cannot be given the needed
  constraints at that level).  The point here is that even with
  the extra capabilities of Schemas (over DTD's), one still might
  need to do "post-validation" at an application level to
  determine if an XML document is "functionally valid."
</p>
<h3>Occurence Constaints</h3>
 <p>
  As well as powerful type declaration, XML Schemas improve upon
  the DTD's ability to declare the cardinality of subelement
  patterns.  However, DTD's always had a clumsier way of
  expressing every occurence constraint (cardinality) that XML
  Schemas can.
</p>
<p>
  In DTD's, cardinality is quanitified by one of the symbols "?",
  "*" and "+" which specify, respectively, "zero or one," "zero
  or more," "one or more." That is, except for the question mark
  being able to say "it is there or it isn't," nothing in the
  DTD syntax seems to limit the number of occurences of a given
  pattern (whether a single subtag, or a nested sequence of
  them).  So expressing the 1-5 occurences of <em>prodName</em> in the
  above example Schema seems to be a problem.  Likewise, without
  having the XML Schema attribute "minOccurs", we do not seem to
  be able to express the requirement that something occurs some
  specific number of times (other than "at least once").  But
  actually, DTD's minimum quantifiers are good enough, if
  inelegant at times.  The following constraints are equivalent:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML Schema syntax for "seven to twelve" donuts</h4><pre>
&lt;xsd:element name="donutorder"&gt;
   &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
         &lt;xsd:element name="donut" type="xsd:string"
                      minOccurs="7" maxOccurs="12" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;


&lt;!ELEMENT donut (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT donutorder
          (donut,donut,donut,donut,donut,donut,donut,
           donut?,donut?,donut?,donut?,donut?)

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, if you get orders by the gross, DTD's start to look
  <em>really</em> inelegant!
</p>
<h3>Enumeration</h3>
 <p>
  Both DTD's and W3C XML Schemas allow use of enumerated types in
  attributes.  But Schemas are a great improvement in also
  allowing enumerated types in element contents.  The lack of
  those, in my opinion, is a genuine shortcoming of DTD's.
  Furthermore, Schemas' approach to enumeration is general and
  elegant.  A specialized <em>simpleType</em> can contain an enumeration
  "facet." And such a <em>simpleType</em> is automatically suitable for
  either an attribute or element value type.
</p>
<p>
  Let us illustrate each syntax:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML Schema syntax for enumerated attribute</h4><pre>
&lt;xsd:simpleType name="shoe_color"&gt;
   &lt;xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"&gt;
      &lt;xsd:enumeration value="red"/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:enumeration value="green"/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:enumeration value="blue"/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:enumeration value="yellow"/&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name="person" type="person_type"&gt;
   &lt;xsd:attribute name="shoes" type="shoe_color"/&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;


&lt;!ATTLIST person shoes (red | green | blue | yellow)&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The DTD attribute declaration appears just as good (maybe
  better in its conciseness).  But if your model puts shoe_color
  in an element content instead, the DTD falls flat:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML Schema syntax for enumerated element</h4><pre>
&lt;xsd:element name="shoes" type="shoe_color"&gt;


</pre></div><h3>Whither</h3>
 <p>
  W3C XML Schemas let XML programmers express a new set of
  declarative constraints on documents that DTD's are
  insufficient for.  For many programmers, the use of XML
  instance syntax in Schemas also brings a greater measure of
  consistency to different parts of XML work (other disagree, of
  course).  Schemas are certainly destined to grow in
  significance and scope as they become more familiar, and more
  tools are enhanced to work with XML Schemas.
</p>
<p>
  One way to get a jump start on Schema work is to automate
  conversion of existing DTD's to XML Schema format.  Obviously,
  automated conversions cannot add the new expressive
  capabilities of XML Schemas themselves; but automation can
  create good templates from which to specify the specific typing
  constraints one wishes to impose.  The Resources section
  provides two links to automated DTD-to-Schema conversion tools.
