<h1>Xml Matters #31: Sxml And Ssax</h1>
<h2>Manipulating XML in the Scheme Programming Language</h2>

<blockquote>
    Previous installments have looked at XML libraries for various
    programming languages, and with various strengths and weaknesses.
    The Lisp family of languages remains popular, especially in teaching
    and among purists. The SSAX library for Scheme is an efficient
    pure-functional parser; SXML is a tree library (like DOM); and
    related tools SXSLT and SXPath have been created to work with these.
    This installment looks at the advantages of parsing in a strongly
    functional language, and compares SSAX with libraries for other
    languages.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  I am aware--as a factual matter--that there are connoisseurs of
  single-malt scotches. But given that I rarely drink alcohol at all;
  and when I do it in less concentrated amounts as beer or wine, I have
  trouble fully understanding the mindset or discourse of these
  connoisseurs.
</p>
<p>
  I feel almost the same way about Lisp and Scheme programming. I can
  tell that it is an area filled with sophistication and intelligence,
  but somehow both the Polish (prefix) notation and endless parentheses,
  and the fervent semantic eshewal of a distinction between code and
  data, continue to feel alien to me. Nonetheless, I have enough of a
  fascination that I want to see how these languages approach XML
  processing.
</p>
<h3>What Is Sxml?</h3>
 <p>
  The starting point for the <em><code>SSAX</code></em> library for Scheme is a meme common
  among Lisp/Scheme enthusiasts: the observation that XML is
  semantically almost identical to the nested list-oriented data
  structures native to Lisp-like languages.  Anything you can represent
  in XML can be straightforwardly represented as SXML--Scheme lists
  nesting the same data as the original XML.  Moreover, Scheme comes
  with a rich library of list and tree manipulation functions, and a
  history of contemplating manipulation of those very structures.  A
  natural fit, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
  A good first step is to see SXML in its concrete form.  Trees are the
  underlying abstraction--the Infoset--of XML; but the abstract
  information takes a specific semantic form.  For example, the
  following is a starkly reduced (but still well-formed) version of
  another article I wrote recently:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An XML document with most XML features</h4><pre>
$ cat example.xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/css"
      href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/dW.css" ?&gt;
&lt;dw-document xmlns:dw="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;The Twisted Matrix Framework&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author name="David Mertz, Ph.D."&gt;
    &lt;bio&gt;David thinks it's turtles all the way down...&lt;/bio&gt;
  &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;docbody&gt;
    &lt;dw:heading refname="" toc="yes"&gt;Introduction&lt;/dw:heading&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sorting through Twisted Matrix is reminiscent of the old story
      about blind men and elephants. Twisted Matrix has many
      capabilities within it, and it takes a bit of a gestalt switch
      to &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; a good sense of why they are all there.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/docbody&gt;
&lt;/dw-document&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Transformed to SXML, this article looks like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An SXML document with most XML features</h4><pre>
$ ./xml2sxml example.xml
(*TOP* (*PI* xml "version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"")
       (*PI* xml-stylesheet
             "type=\"text/css\"
      href=\"http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/dW.css\" ")
       (dw-document
         (title "The Twisted Matrix Framework")
         (author
           (@ (name "David Mertz, Ph.D."))
           (bio "David thinks it's turtles all the way down..."))
         (docbody
           (http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/:heading
             (@ (toc "yes") (refname ""))
             "Introduction")
           (p "

              (i "get")
              " a good sense of why they are all there.
    "))))

</pre></div><p>
  There are a number of interesting differences between XML and SXML,
  but also a obvious and direct correspondence between every aspect.
  Some of the differences are relatively trivial--parentheses instead of
  angle brackets, for example. And others are ambivalent: for example,
  SSAX's creator, Oleg Kiselyov, thinks the reduction of closing tags to
  closing parentheses is a pure advantage in conciseness. However, the
  designers of XML went out of their way to remove the tag reduction
  options in SGML; maybe they were wrong, but explicit closing tags are
  not there because their possibility was overlooked.
</p>
<p>
  In a number of ways, however, SXML corrects some awkwardness in XML,
  while not losing any information. In particular, the distinction
  between attributes and element contents feels arbitrary to most XML
  developers, and SXML removes it in an elegant way.  An attribute
  collection is simply another nested list, but one that happens to
  start with the name <code>@</code>--a name that conveniently is not permitted in
  XML identifiers.  Effectively, an SXML document is like an XML
  document that eshews attributes, but sometimes nests a <code>&lt;@&gt;</code> child
  inside other elements.  Referring to children that happen to be named
  <code>@</code> is no different in SXML is no different the filtering on any other
  tag name.  Of interest is that both my <em><code>gnosis.xml.objectify</code></em> and
  RelaxNG stylesheets attempt a similar homogenization of attributes and
  elements.
</p>
<p>
  Processing instructions and comments are also reduced to special "tag"
  names that are not available in XML: <code><strong>PI</strong></code> for the former,
  <code><strong>COMMENT</strong></code> for the latter.  As with most of Lisp, there is just one
  basic data structure to represent everything.
</p>
<p>
  Namespaces are also interesting in the SXML format. The full namespace
  URI simply becomes part of the tagname, when SXML is generated as
  above. However, and optional <code><strong>NAMESPACES</strong></code> tag can be used to
  abbreviate namespace references in essentially the same way as with
  XML. You need to either write SXML by hand, or enhance the conversion
  utility, to utilize this, however.
</p>
<h3>Working With The Ssax Library</h3>
 <p>
  From the description above, SXML seems like just another shortcut
  notation for XML, or which there are many, e.g. PYX, SOX, SLiP,
  XSLTXT, YAML (sort of), etc.  The difference is that SXML is not
  merely (arguably) simpler to read and edit, but is already itself code
  in Scheme.  No special parsers for the format are needed or even
  relevant.
</p>
<p>
  As a first example of working with the <em><code>SSAX</code></em> library, let us take a
  look at the application <code>xml2sxml</code> that was utilized above:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>xml2sxml conversion script</h4><pre>
#!/sw/bin/guile -s
!#
(load "sxml-all.scm")
(pp (SSAX:XML-&gt;SXML (open-input-file (cadr (command-line))) '() ))

</pre></div><p>
  Not too much too it, huh? Of course, this relies on a collection of
  <code>load</code> functions that I put into my convenience module:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>sxml-all.scm support file</h4><pre>
(load "libs/pp.scm")
(load "libs/guile/common.scm")
(load "libs/guile/myenv.scm")
(load "libs/guile/parse-error.scm")
(load "libs/util.scm")
(load "libs/input-parse.scm")
(load "libs/look-for-str.scm")
(load "sxml/ssax.scm")
(define (port? x) (or (input-port? x) (output-port? x)))

</pre></div><p>
  I may not need all of those <code>load</code> functions every time, but this
  loads the complete collection of <em><code>SSAX</code></em> functions.  The last line is
  an oddity--for whatever reason, the function <code>port?</code> that is used by
  <em><code>SSAX</code></em> is not available in the version of Guile that I installed on
  MacOSX using <code>fink</code>.  However, the definition I added comes straight
  out of the manual for Guile.  A different Scheme system would
  presumably not have this same issue.
</p>
<p>
  The data structure produced by the function <code>SSAX:XML-&gt;SXML</code> is a
  regular list that you can work with using all the usual Scheme
  functions.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>guile&gt; (load "sxml-all.scm")
guile&gt; (define sxml
         (SSAX:XML-&gt;SXML (open-input-file "example.xml") `()))
guile&gt; (list-ref sxml 1)
(*PI* xml "version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"")
guile&gt; (cadr (list-ref sxml 3))
(title "The Twisted Matrix Framework")
guile&gt; (eq? (car (list-ref sxml 3)) `dw-document)
#t

</pre></div><h3>Using Ssax</h3>
 <p>
  While an SXML representation is just a tree that can be manipulated
  and traversed with general Scheme techniques, the <em><code>SSAX</code></em> library
  provides a handy macro called <code>SSAX:make-parser</code> that works in a
  fashion similar to the SAX API in other programming languages.  A
  number of tree-walking optimizations are built in to this macro,
  giving you linear, O(N), efficiencies in processing a given SXML
  structure; a naive approach could easily use more memory or CPU
  time.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the actual SAX API that you might have used in languages like
  C, C++, Python, Perl, and the like, <em><code>SSAX</code></em> is walks a tree rather than
  scans a linear bytestream. That is, SAX or <em><code>expat</code></em> simply look for
  opening and closing tags as events, and callback to the relevant
  handlers. If you want to keep track of the relative nesting and
  context in which a tag occurs, you need to maintain your own stack, or
  other data structure. In <em><code>SSAX</code></em>, in contrast, every node descends from
  a parent, passing and returning a <code>seed</code> Of course, this <code>seed</code> is
  itself essentially a data structure that you can modify in each
  <code>NEW-LEVEL-SEED</code> and <code>FINISH-ELEMENT</code> handler--but at least it is
  local rather than global.
</p>
<p>
  To show off the working of <em><code>SSAX</code></em> I have enhanced an outline example
  that is available on the CVS directory for the <em><code>SSAX</code></em> library.  I
  demonstrate displaying attributes and (abbreviated) CDATA content.
  This is most of the way toward writing an <code>sxml2xml</code> utility--one
  which oddly is <strong>not</strong> distributed as part of <em><code>SSAX</code></em>, not even as a
  direct function or macro.  However, I do not handle proper escaping,
  nor processing instructions and a few other aspects.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>outline conversion script</h4><pre>
#!/sw/bin/guile -s
!#
(load "sxml-all.scm")

(define (format-attrs attrs)
  (if (and (pair? attrs) (pair? (car attrs)))
    (string-append " " (caar attrs) "='" (cdar attrs) "'"
      (if (&gt; (length attrs) 1)
        (format-attrs (cdr attrs)) ""))
    ""))

(define (tag-&gt;string tag)
  (if (symbol? tag) tag (cdr tag)))

(define (outline xml-port)
  ((SSAX:make-parser
      NEW-LEVEL-SEED
      (lambda (elem-gi attrs namespaces expected-content seed)
        (display (string-append
          seed                  ; indent the element name
          "&lt;"                   ; open brace
          (tag-&gt;string elem-gi) ; print the name of the element
          (format-attrs attrs)  ; display the attributes
          "&gt;\n"))               ; closing brace, newline
        (string-append "  " seed)) ; advance the indent level

      FINISH-ELEMENT
      (lambda (elem-gi attributes namespaces parent-seed seed)
          parent-seed)          ; restore the indent level

      CHAR-DATA-HANDLER
      (lambda (s1 s2 seed)
        (if (&gt; (string-length s1) 30)
          (display
            (string-append seed "|" (substring s1 0 30) "...\n")))
        seed)

      ) xml-port ""))

(display (call-with-input-file (cadr (command-line)) outline)))

</pre></div><p>
  The basics are a lot like a SAX class. The function <code>outline</code> is
  generated with the <code>SSAX:make-parser</code> macro which allows definition of
  several event types.  The main ones are entering and leaving an
  element, and getting character data.  A couple support functions help
  with the process.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>seed</code> we use in <code>outline</code> is quite simple, it is just a string
  that gets longer as deeper branches of the tree are reached.  Of
  course, you <em>could</em> pass around a whole list of encountered tags--e.g.
  for an XPATH-like analysis of what to do with a node.  Our CDATA
  handler simply checks whether there is enough CDATA to bother
  displaying (at least 30 chars, arbitrarily chosen), then displays it
  at the same indent as the current element.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>NEW-LEVEL-SEED</code> handler demonstrates a couple interesting
  aspects, mostly in the two support functions it employs. Not every tag
  is a simple symbol in our SSXML structure; specifically, a namespace
  qualified tag is a pair instead.  The function <code>tag-&gt;string</code> checks
  which type a tag is, and only displays the local part of the name, not
  the namespace.  You could do something different, of course, but this
  demonstrates the test needed.
</p>
<p>
  The function <code>format-attrs</code> is probably more an example of recursive
  programming in Scheme generically than it is specific to <em><code>SSAX</code></em>.
  Still, tags can have none, one, or several attributes, and we need to
  return a string for each case.  Probably a real Scheme programmer can
  point out an even more concise way to do this--I welcome comments in
  the discussion are for this article.
</p>
<p>
  Let us look at the output, given the earlier XML document.  By the
  way, warnings are generated for the unprocessed PIs, so I redirect
  STDERR to ignore those:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An outline display of example.xml</h4><pre>
$ ./outline example.xml 2&gt;/dev/null
&lt;dw-document&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
  &lt;author name='David Mertz, Ph.D.'&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      |

      &lt;i&gt;
      | a good sense of why they are ...

</pre></div><h3>What Else?</h3>
 <p>
  As well as its equivalents for SAX and DOM (i.e. the native Scheme
  nested lists), <em><code>SSAX</code></em> comes with its own <em><code>SXPath</code></em> and <em><code>SXSLT</code></em>
  components.  This article does not have room for extensive discussion
  of these, but they are worth mentioning briefly.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the <em><code>SXPath</code></em> and <em><code>SXSLT</code></em> functions and macros
  discussed in Oleg Kiselyov's document "XML, XPath, XSLT
  implementations as SXML, SXPPath and SXSLT" are not included in the
  <em><code>SSAX</code></em> distribution, at least not the one for Guile (other
  distributions are available for a number of Scheme systems).  What can
  be easily downloaded only works with a few Scheme-systems, and
  versioning is unclear.  Based just on the document mentioned, SXPath
  works much like XPath.  For example, either of the following
  expressions expand to a selection function:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>SXPath expressions, native and textual</h4><pre>
((sxpath '(// TAF VALID @ Trange *text)) document)
((txpath "//TAF/VALID/@TRange/text()") document)

</pre></div><p>
  These undergo macro expansion to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Full path selector function</h4><pre>
((node-join
  (node-closure (node-typeof? 'TAF))
  (select-kids (node-typeof? 'VALID))
  (select-kids (node-typeof? '@))
  (select-kids (node-typeof? 'TRange))
  (select-kids (node-typeof? '*text*)))
document)

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, playing with this expanded form would allow programming
  arbitrary calculations inside an XPath-like selector--anything you can
  write in Scheme.
</p>
<p>
  SXSLT is similar in concept.  Stylesheets are written in Scheme form
  that is semantically similar to XSLT.  But much as with the
  flexibility of <em><code>HaXml</code></em>, within any particular transformation rule, you
  can embed arbitrary extra code.  Particular XSLT engines, of course,
  often come with foreign-function APIs to write extra capabilities in
  Javascript, VB, or other languages.  But with SXSLT, the custom
  functions are written in the very same Scheme language as the
  transformation stylesheet elements.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  I like the <em><code>SSAX</code></em> library quite a bit; and I suspect I will like it
  more as I become more comfortable with Lisp/Scheme.programming.  It
  shares many of the advantages of other "native" XML libraries I have
  written about in other installments: <em><code>gnosis.xml.objectify</code></em>, <em><code>REXML</code></em>,
  <em><code>XML::Grove</code></em>, <em><code>HaXml</code></em>, and so on.  There's a lot to be said for making
  XML into <em>just another data object</em> in whatever programming language
  you use.
</p>
<p>
  That said, <em><code>SSAX</code></em> has a lot of rough edges.  It is hard to figure out
  what to download, and what Scheme systems each part is available for.
  The documentation is somewhat inconsistent and incomplete--most of the
  documents are academic in focus, and do more to discuss abstract goals
  and concepts than on concrete usage and API.  As a demonstration of
  what is possible in Scheme--using functional techniques--these papers
  are interesting; but it would be nice to have something that is easy
  to install and use, and <em>just works</em>.

  Haskell is purer in its functional programming paradigm, many common
