<blockquote>
    There are at least two attitudes one can have towards XML
    processing.  One attitude is to adopt standard API's that can
    be called from many programming languages.  A second approach
    is to tailor an XML processing library to the specific
    strengths of the programming language you will develop an XML
    application in.  Early installments of this column have
    looked at versions of the second attitude <em></em> with the
    author's own Python <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> and <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, and
    with the Haskell <em><code>HaXml</code></em> library.  A commonly used library
    for the fiarly new, but rapidly growing Ruby programming
    language also takes the second attitude.  The "Ruby Electric
    XML" (REXML) library takes the strenghts of Ruby, and builds
    XML processing around those.  <em><code>REXML</code></em> has analogs for the
    stream-style of SAX and the tree-style of DOM, but restricts
    itself to neither API directly.
</blockquote>
<h3>Preface</h3>
 <p>
  Regular readers of this column have almost certainly detected
  my dissatisfaction with the most popular techniques for
  manipulating XML documents.  The articles that have discussed
  my Python <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> modify has largely been in response
  to the complexity of DOM.  My introduction to the Haskell
  <em><code>HaXml</code></em> library was primarily a reaction to a perceived
  obtuseness of XSLT.  Continuing this pattern, I find SAX also
  to be far "heavier" than is necessary for many of the problems
  SAX solves.
</p>
<p>
  The SAX API is, by far, more lightweight than either DOM or
  XSLT--not only in terms of computer resources, but more
  importantly in terms of programmer effort and learning curve.
  Even so, even SAX demands that an XML programmer utilize a
  parser library, and conform to a callback API.  The data inside
  XML documents simply is not complex enough to warrant these
  demands.  In my opinion, there ought to be an easier way to
  handle XML documents; and in particular, one ought to be more
  free to use a variety of familiar tools and techniques when
  manipulating XML.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  Let me first introduce the Ruby language.  I cannot say nearly
  enough here to get unfamiliar readers up to speed--for that I
  recommend consulting the sources in the Resources.  But as a
  programmer learning the Ruby language myself, I can let readers
  know <em>why</em> it is interesting.  Ruby is a "scripting" language
  that has been described as "Perl done right;" but then again,
  so probably has every newer scripting language, including
  Python.  For Ruby, the description rings truer, not in the
  sense that Perl is done wrong (no language flames here), but in
  the sense the Ruby keeps much of Perl's conciseness and many of
  its shortcuts, while starting from a clean Smalltalk-ish OOP
  attitude.  Moreover, at least to me, Ruby achieves conciseness
  while still avoiding the "executable line noise" quality that
  some Perl code has.  At the same time, a number of Ruby
  constructs "feel" more direct than Python versions (even if not
  really saving much overall length).
</p>
<p>
  <em><code>REXML</code></em> is a library written by Sean Russell.  It is not the only
  XML library for Ruby, but it is a popular one, and is written
  in pure Ruby (so is <em><code>NQXML</code></em>, but <em><code>XMLParser</code></em> wraps around the
  Jade library, written in C) In his REXML overview, he comments:
</p>
<blockquote>
    I have this problem:  I dislike obscifucated <em><code>sic</code></em> APIs.
    There are several XML parser APIs for Java.  Most of them
    follow DOM or SAX, and are very similar in philosophy with an
    increasing number of Java APIs. Namely, they look like they
    were designed by theorists who never had to use their own
    APIs. The extant XML APIs, in general, suck.  They take a
    markup language which was specifically designed to be very
    simple, elegant, and powerful, and wrap an obnoxious,
    bloated, and large API around it.  I was always having to
    refer to the API documentation to do even the most basic XML
    tree manipulations; nothing was intuitive, and almost every
    operation was complex.
</blockquote>
<p>
  While I might not have put it quite as stridently, I agree with
  Russell--XML APIs are just plain too much work for most of what
  one does with them.
</p>
<h3>Making Easy Things Easy</h3>
 <p>
  I would guess that what 80% of all the programmers who need to
  deal with XML documents really want is just a way to grab the
  data and easily manipulate it as (structured) data.  DOM makes
  this hard, and SAX makes it even harder.  In several previous
  articles, I have advocated the clarity and simplicity of my own
  Python <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> module.  Let me repeat a quick example,
  using an the file <code>address.xml</code> which describes an address
  book:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>How to refer to nested data using xml_objectify</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from xml_objectify import XML_Objectify
&gt;&gt;&gt; addressbook = XML_Objectify('address.xml').make_instance()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print addressbook.person[1].address.city
New York

</pre></div><p>
  We need to know a little bit the format of the data (see
  Resources for the sample document, used throughout this
  article).  But not too much.  We need to know that the root of
  the document is the address book (but not necessarily that it
  is named <code>&lt;addressbook&gt;</code>).  And we need to know that the
  document can list multiple persons (but nothing goes wrong if
  there is only one, who can still be referred to as
  <code>addressbook.person[0]</code>).  All the rest of what we need to know
  is that, conceptually, persons have addresses and addresses
  have cities.  It all <em>just works</em>!
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, DOM--which advertises itself as OOP-ified
  XML--makes us jump through hoops.  The first challenge is
  referring to the root element; at least five different ways
  come to mind:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using DOM to name the XML document root</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from xml.dom import minidom
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom = minidom.parse('address.xml')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom.firstChild
&lt;DOM Element: addressbook at 1811436&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom._get_documentElement()
&lt;DOM Element: addressbook at 1811436&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom._get_firstChild()
&lt;DOM Element: addressbook at 1811436&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom.getElementsByTagName('addressbook')[0]
&lt;DOM Element: addressbook at 1811436&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom.childNodes[0]
&lt;DOM Element: addressbook at 1811436&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  One also has to guess a bit about exactly what is a method and
  what is an attribute (or keep a manual handy).  Given that we
  know we want the root element, probably the
  <code>._get_documentElement()</code> method is the best choice.  Now what
  if we want to find our way down to the second person's city, as
  in the <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> example?
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>How to refer to nested data using DOM</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; addressbook = dom._get_documentElement()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print addressbook.getElementsByTagName('person')[1].\
... getElementsByTagName('address')[0].getAttribute('city')
New York

</pre></div><p>
  This style is quite verbose, but is probably the closest DOM
  equivalent.  One might use the <code>.childNodes</code> attribute array
  directly to save a few characters, but this is fragile if, for
  example, there are children of <code>&lt;addressbook&gt;</code> that are things
  other than <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>.  One also has to know the nitty-gritty
  detail that <code>city</code> is an element attribute rather than a subtag
  content (either way might make sense for the basic data in
  question).
</p>
<h3>Using Rexml In Tree Mode</h3>
 <p>
  <em><code>REXML</code></em> has the goal of <em>just working</em>.  For the most part, it
  succeeds pretty well.  Actually, <em><code>REXML</code></em> supports two different
  styles of XML processing, both "tree" and "stream."  The first
  is an easier version of what DOM tries to do; the second is an
  easier version of what SAX tries to do.  Let us look at the
  tree style first.  Suppose we want to grab the same address
  book document in the prior example.  The below examples, by the
  way, are from a modified <code>eval.rb</code> that I created; the standard
  <code>eval.rb</code> (linked to in the Ruby tutorial) can display
  extremely long results from expression evaluations of complex
  objects--mine remains quiet in the non-error case:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>How to refer to nested data using REXML</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; require "rexml/document"
ruby&gt; include REXML
ruby&gt; addrbook = (Document.new File.new "address.xml").root
ruby&gt; persons = addrbook.elements.to_a("//person")
ruby&gt; puts persons[1].elements["address"].attributes["city"]
New York

</pre></div><p>
  This expression is rather natural.  The <code>.to_a()</code> method creates
  an array of all the <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> elements in the document, which
  can be useful in other naming.  An element is something like a
  DOM node, but is really much closer to the XML itself (while
  also remaining simpler to work with).  The argument to
  <code>.to_a()</code> is an XPATH, in this case identifying all the
  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> elements anywhere in the document.  If we strictly
  wanted the one at the first level, we might use:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Creating an array of matching elements</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; persons = addrbook.elements.to_a("/addressbook/person")

</pre></div><p>
  We can use XPATHs even more directly as overloaded indexes to
  the <code>.elements</code> attribute.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Another way to refer to nested data using REXML</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements["//person[2]/address"].attributes["city"]
New York

</pre></div><p>
  Notice that XPATH uses one-based indexing, unlike the
  zero-based indexing of Ruby and Python arrays.  In other words,
  it is still the same person whose city we are checking.  We can
  see more about this person by looking at the <em><code>REXML</code></em> elements
  themselves:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Displaying the XML source of elements with REXML</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements["//person[2]/address"]
&lt;address city='New York' street='118 St.' number='344' state='NY'/&gt;
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements["//person[2]/contact-info"]
&lt;contact-info&gt;
  &lt;email address='robb@iro.ibm.com'/&gt;
  &lt;home-phone number='03-3987873'/&gt;
&lt;/contact-info&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Moreover, XPATHs need not match just one element.  We saw this
  in defining the <code>persons</code> array, but another example emphasizes
  it:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Matching multiple elements with XPATHs</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements.to_a("//person/address[@state='CA']")
&lt;address city='Sacramento' street='Spruce Rd.' number='99' state='CA'/&gt;
&lt;address city='Los Angeles' street='Pine Rd.' number='1234' state='CA'/&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  In contrast, the indexing of the <code>.elements</code> attribute only
  produces the <em>first</em> matching element:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>When XPATHs match only the first occurrence</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements["//person/address[@state='CA']"]
&lt;address city='Sacramento' street='Spruce Rd.' number='99' state='CA'/&gt;
ruby&gt; puts addrbook.elements.to_a("//person/address[@state='CA']")[0]
&lt;address city='Sacramento' street='Spruce Rd.' number='99' state='CA'/&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  XPATH addresses may also be used via the <code>XPath</code> class in
  <em><code>REXML</code></em>, which has methods such as <code>.first()</code>, <code>.each()</code> and
  <code>.match()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  One particularly idiomatic method of <em><code>REXML</code></em> elements is the
  <code>.each</code> iterator.  While Ruby has a looping construct <code>for</code>
  that can operate over collections, Ruby programmers generally
  prefer to use iterator methods that pass control to a
  codeblock.  The two following constructs are equivalent, but
  the second has a more natural feel in Ruby:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Iterating through matching XPATHs in REXML</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; for addr in addrbook.elements.to_a("//address[@state='CA']")
    |    puts addr.attributes["city"]
    | end
Sacramento
Los Angeles
ruby&gt; addrbook.elements.each("//address[@state='CA']") {
    |    |addr| puts addr.attributes["city"]
    | }
Sacramento
Los Angeles


</pre></div><h3>Using Rexml In Stream Mode</h3>
 <p>
  For purposes of "just working" the tree mode of <em><code>REXML</code></em> is
  probably the easiest approach in the Ruby language.  But
  <em><code>REXML</code></em> also offers a stream mode that is a lot like a lighter
  weight variant of SAX.  As with SAX, <em><code>REXML</code></em> gives the
  application programmer no default data structures from the XML
  document.  Instead, a "listener" or "handler" class is
  responsible for providing a set of methods that respond to
  various events in the document stream.  These are the usual
  collection:  a tag starts, a tag ends, element text is
  encountered, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  While stream mode is not nearly as effortless as working in
  tree mode, it should generally be much faster.  The <em><code>REXML</code></em>
  tutorial claims that stream mode is <em>one thousand five hundred</em>
  times as fast.  While I have not attempted to benchmark it, I
  suspect this is a limit case (my small examples were still
  instantaneous in tree mode).  Either way, the difference in
  speed is likely to be significant, if speed matters.
</p>
<p>
  Let us look at just a very simple example that does the same
  thing as the "list the California cities" examples above.
  Extending this to complex document processing is relatively
  straightforward:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Stream processing XML documents in REXML</h4><pre>
ruby&gt; require "rexml/document"
ruby&gt; require "rexml/streamlistener"
ruby&gt; include REXML
ruby&gt; class Handler
    |    include StreamListener
    |    def tag_start name, attrs
    |       if name=="address" and attrs.assoc("state")[1]=="CA"
    |          puts attrs.assoc("city")[1]
    |       end
    |    end
    | end
ruby&gt; Document.parse_stream((File.new "address.xml"), Handler.new)
Sacramento
Los Angeles

</pre></div><p>
  One thing to note in the stream processing example is that tag
  attributes are passed as an array of arrays, which is slightly
  more work to handle than a hash would be (but is probably
  faster to create within the library).
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  This installment has looked at one more light-weight
  alternative to the cumbersome APIs of DOM, SAX and XSLT.  Along
  with the <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, PYX and <em><code>HaXml</code></em> options that earlier
  installments have examined, Ruby programmers also have a quick
  way of processing XML without a steep learning curve.

  I have also looked at Ruby creator Yukihiro Matsumoto's book
  for O'Reilly called <cite>Ruby in a Nutshell</cite>.  As a programmer
  learning Ruby, this is confessedly probably not as well suited
  to me as to a more experienced Ruby users.  Even taking into
  account my inexperience, I get the feeling this book was "not
  quite translated enough" (from the Japanese text it derives
  from).  While <cite>Ruby in a Nutshell</cite> is very well organized as a
  reference, a good number of the descriptions left me scratching
  my head, and remaining uncertain about occassional subtleties
  of the language.
