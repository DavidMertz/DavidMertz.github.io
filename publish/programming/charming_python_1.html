    A major element of getting started on working with XML in
    Python is sorting out the comparative capabilities of all the
    available modules.  This article provides brief descriptions of
    the most popular and useful XML-related Python modules, and
    points the reader to resources where she can download and read
    more about individual modules.  A focus of this article is to
    help the reader determine which modules are most appropriate
    for a specific task at hand.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python? What Is Xml?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<p>
  XML is a simplified dialect of the Standard Generalized Markup
  Language (SGML).  Many readers will be most familiar with SGML
  via one particular document type, HTML.  XML documents are
  similar to HTML in being composed of text interspersed with and
  structured by markup tags in angle-brackets.  But XML
  encompasses many systems of tags that allow XML documents to be
  used for many purposes:  magazine articles and user
  documentation, files of structured data (like CSV or EDI
  files), messages for interprocess communication between
  programs, architectural diagrams (like CAD formats), and many
  other purposes.  A set of tags can be created to capture any
  sort of structured information one might want to represent,
  which is why XML is growing in popularity as a common standard
  for representing diverse information.
</p>
<h3>This And That</h3>
 <p>
  Python is, in many ways, an ideal language for working with XML
  documents.  Like Perl, REBOL, REXX, and TCL it is a flexible
  scripting language with powerful text manipulation
  capabilities.  Moreover, more than most types of text files (or
  streams), XML documents typically encode rich and complex data
  structures.  The familiar "read some lines and compare them to
  some regular expressions" style of text processing is generally
  not well-suited to adequately parsing and processing XML.
  Python, fortunately (and more so than most other languages),
  has both straightforward ways of dealing with complex data
  structures (usually with classes and attributes), and a range
  of XML-related modules to aid in parsing, processing, and
  generating XML.
</p>
<p>
  One general concept to keep in mind about XML is that XML
  documents can be processed in either a validating or
  non-validating fashion.  In the former type of processing, it
  is necessary to read a "Document Type Definition" (DTD) prior
  to reading an XML document it applies to.  The processing in
  this case will evaluate not just the simple syntactic rules for
  XML documents in general, but also the specific grammatical
  constraints of the DTD.  In many cases, non-validating
  processing is adequate (and generally both faster to run, and
  easier to program)--we trust the document creator to follow the
  rules of the document domain.  Most modules discussed below are
  non-validating; descriptions will indicate where validation
  options exist.
</p>
<p>
  The Vaults of Parnassus (http://www.vex.net/parnassus/)
  has become the standard means of finding Python resources of
  late.  All of the modules discussed below can be found at that
  site (via links to the respective module owner's sites).  In
  particular, the PyXML distribution can be found as both a
  tarball and as a Win32 installer in the Vaults.
</p>
<h3>Python's Xml Special Interest Group (xml-sig)</h3>
 <p>
  Much--or most--of the effort of maintaining a range of XML
  tools for Python is performed by members of the XML-SIG.  As
  with other Python Special Interest Groups, the XML-SIG
  maintains a mailing list, list archive, helpful references,
  documentation, a standard packaging, and other resources.
  Probably the best place to start after reading the summaries in
  this article is with the XML-SIG web pages.
</p>
<p>
  Of specific interest for this article, the XML-SIG maintains
  the PyXML distribution.  This package contains many of the
  modules discussed in this article, some "getting started"
  documentation, some demonstration code, and whatever else the
  XML-SIG might decide to throw into the distribution.  A given
  package may not always contain the "bleeding edge" version of
  each individual module or tool, but downloading the PyXML
  distribution is a good place to start.  You can always add any
  modules that are not included, or any new versions of included
  modules, later (and many of the modules that are not included
  themselves rely on services provided by the PyXML
  distribution).
</p>
<h3>Module: Xmllib Module (standard)</h3>
 <p>
  "Out of the box," Python 1.5.x comes with the module <em><code>xmllib</code></em>.
  Python 1.6 is likely to incorporate more of the XML-SIG's
  efforts, but that version is still in alpha.  <em><code>xmllib</code></em> is a
  non-validating and low-level parser.  The way <em><code>xmllib</code></em> works is
  by the application programmer overriding the class XMLParser,
  and providing methods to handle document elements, such as
  specific or generic tags, or character entities.
</p>
<p>
  As an example of <em><code>xmllib</code></em> in action, the PyXML distribution
  includes a DTD called <code>quotations.dtd</code> and a document called
  <code>sample.xml</code> of this DTD (see Resources for an archive of files
  mentioned in this article).  The below code will display the
  first few lines of each quotation in <code>sample.xml</code>, and produce
  very simple ASCII indicators of unknown tags and entities.  The
  parsed text is handled as a sequential stream, and any
  accumulators used are the programmer's responsibility (such as
  the string of characters (#PCDATA) within a tag, or a
  list/dictionary of tags encountered).

        parser.feed(c)
    parser.close()</PRE></div><h3>Other Parsing Modules</h3>
 <p>
  Several additional parsing modules with varying capabilities
  are included in the PyXML distribution.  These all aim to
  provide some improvement over the base <em><code>xmllib</code></em> module.
</p>
<p>
  <em><code>pyexpat</code></em> is a wrapper for the GPL'd XML Parser Toolkit
  <code>expat</code>.  <code>expat</code> in turn is a library written in C that is
  meant to be available from any language that wants to utilize
  it.  <code>expat</code> is non-validating, and should be much faster than
  a native Python parser.  <em><code>sgmlop</code></em> is similar in purpose to
  <em><code>pyexpat</code></em>.  It is also non-validating, and also written in C.
  <em><code>pyexpat</code></em> is available as a MacOS binary, and <em><code>sgmlop</code></em> is
  available as a Win32 binary; but if you need a different
  platform than these, you will need to use a C compiler to
  build the modules for your own platform.
</p>
<p>
  <em><code>xmlproc</code></em> is a python native parser, which performs nearly
  complete validation.  If you need a validating parser,
  <em><code>xmlproc</code></em> is currently your only choice in Python.  As well,
  <em><code>xmlproc</code></em> provides a variety of high-level and experimental
  interfaces that other parsers do not.
</p>
<p>
  If you decide to use the Simple API for XML (SAX)--which you
  should for anything sophisticated, since most other tools are
  built on top of it--much of the work of sorting through parsers
  can be done for you.  In the PyXML distribution,
  <em><code>xml.sax.drivers</code></em> contains thin wrappers for a number of
  parsers, including all those discussed, with names of the form
  <code>drv_*.py</code>.  However, generally you will access the drivers by
  a higher level SAX facility that will automatically choose the
  "best" parser available on the system where run:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python lines for selecting best parser</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.sax.saxext <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> *
parser = XMLParserFactory.make_parser()</PRE></div><p>
  These lines will select a parser for you (including <em><code>xmllib</code></em>,
  as a fallback).  You may also select a specific parser by
  passing an argument in; but for portability--and also for
  upward compatibility with an even better parser yet to come--it
  is probably best to let <code>make_parser()</code> do the work for you.
</p>
<h3>Package: Sax</h3>
 <p>
  We have mentioned above that SAX can automatically choose a
  parser to use; but just what is SAX? A good answer is:
</p>
<blockquote>
    SAX (Simple API for XML) is a common parser interface for XML
    parsers.  It allows application writers to write applications
    that use XML parsers, but are independent of which parser is
    actually used.  (Think of it as JDBC for XML.)" (Lars Marius
    Garshol, SAX for Python, see Resources)
</blockquote>
<p>
  SAX--like the parser modules it provides an API for--is
  essentially a sequential processor of an XML document.  You use
  it in a manner largely similar to the <em><code>xmllib</code></em> example, but
  with a somewhat higher-level of abstraction.  Instead of
  defining a parser class, an application programmer defines a
  <code>handler</code> class that is registered with whatever parser is
  used.  Four SAX interfaces must be defined (each with several
  methods):  DocumentHandler, DTDHandler, EntityResolver and
  ErrorHandler.  Base classes of all of these are provided, but
  in most cases it is easiest to inherit from <code>HandlerBase</code>,
  which itself inherits from all four interfaces.  You can
  override whatever you wish to.  Some code will help illustrate
  this; the sample performs the same task as the <em><code>xmllib</code></em>
  example.

    parser.setDocumentHandler(handler)
    parser.parseFile(open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"sample.xml"</FONT>))
    parser.close()</PRE></div><p>
  Two small things to notice about the example in contrast to
  <em><code>xmllib</code></em> are:  the <code>parseFile()</code> / <code>parse()</code> methods handle a whole
  stream/string so there is no need to create a loop to feed the
  parser; relatedly, <code>characters()</code> is fed chunks of data whose
  size and position with the passed string are indicated by
  arguments.  Don't make any assumptions about what the <code>ch</code>
  variable will as passed to <code>characters()</code>.
</p>
<h3>Package: Dom</h3>
 <p>
  DOM is a very-high-level tree-based representation of an XML
  document.  The model is not specific to Python, but is a common
  XML model (see Resources for further information).  Python's
  DOM package is built upon SAX, and is included in the PyXML
  distribution.  Length contraints prevent code samples in this
  article, but an excellent general description is given in the
  XML-SIG's "Python/XML HOWTO":
</p>
<blockquote>
    The Document Object Model specifies a tree-based
    representation for an XML document.  A top-level Document
    instance is the root of the tree, and has a single child
    which is the top-level Element instance; this Element has
    children nodes representing the content and any sub-elements,
    which may have further children, and so forth.  Functions are
    defined which let you traverse the resulting tree any way you
    like, access element and attribute values, insert and delete
    nodes, and convert the tree back into XML.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The DOM is useful for modifying XML documents, because you
    can create a DOM tree, modify it by adding new nodes and
    moving subtrees around, and then produce a new XML document
    as output.  You can also construct a DOM tree yourself, and
    convert it to XML; this is often a more flexible way of
    producing XML output than simply writing &lt;tag1&gt;...&lt;/tag1&gt; to
    a file.
</blockquote>
<h3>Module: Pyxie</h3>
 <p>
  The <em><code>pyxie</code></em> module is built on top of the PyXML distribution
  from the XML-SIG, and provides additional high-level interfaces
  to an XML document.  <em><code>pyxie</code></em> does two basic things:  it
  transforms XML documents to a more easily parsed line-oriented
  format; and it provides methods to treat an XML document as a
  walkable tree.  The line-oriented PYX format used by <em><code>pyxie</code></em> is
  language-independent, and tools are available for several
  languages.  In general, a PYX representation of a document is
  much easier to process using familiar line-oriented
  text-processing tools like grep, sed, awk, bash, perl--or
  standard python modules like, <em><code>string</code></em> and <em><code>re</code></em>--than is its
  XML representation.  Depending on what is downstream, a
  transformation from XML to PYX might save a lot of work.
</p>
<p>
  <em><code>pyxie</code></em>'s concept of treating an XML document like a tree is
  similar to the ideas in DOM.  Since the DOM standard is gaining
  widespread support across a number of programming languages, it
  will probably make sense for most programmers to focus on that
  standard rather than on <em><code>pyxie</code></em> if tree-representation of XML
  documents is a requirement.
</p>
<h3>Module: Xml Parser</h3>
 <p>
  The too generically--and perhaps a bit wrongly--named <code>XML
  Parser</code> is a somewhat older tool to check the syntacticality
  and well-formedness of an XML document (but not to validate
  against a DTD).  One extra utility class implements a bit of
  fuzziness in the checking to get HTML documents to pass (even
  without having all the closing tags XML requires).  The range
  of applicability of this module is not as broad as those in the
  PyXML distribution.  But it is easy to get up-and-running with
  XML Parser if your requirement is just to verify some XML
  documents.  The module will check an XML document on STDIN if
  run from the command line without even bothering to import it
  into your program.  You can't get much easier than that.
</p>
<h3>Module: Xml_objects 0.1</h3>
 <p>
  Like other high-level tools, <em><code>xml_objects</code></em> is built on top of
  SAX.  The purpose of <em><code>xml_objects</code></em> is to transform an XML
  document into a two dimensional grid representation that can
  more easily be stored in a relational database.
