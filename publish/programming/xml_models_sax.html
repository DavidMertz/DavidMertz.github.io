<blockquote>This series looks at several distinct  conceptual models  that 
exist for manipulation of XML    documents. The Simple API for XML (SAX) is
a widely used, and frequently    implemented, approach to the procedural and
sequential processing of an XML    document. We look at what it means to
treat an XML document as a series of    events, and handled in an event-driven 
programming context. Source code    examples of using SAX are provided, along 
with pointers to further resources.  </blockquote>
  <h2>About This Series</h2>
  <p>As XML has developed into a widely used data format, a number of programming 
  models have arisen for manipulating XML documents. Some of these models--or 
  "paradigms"--have been enshrined as standards, while others remain only 
 informally specified (but equally widely used nonetheless). In a general 
way,  the several models available for manipulating XML documents closely 
mirror the  underlying approaches and techniques that programmers in different 
traditions  bring to the task of working with XML. It is worth noticing that 
"models" are at  a higher level of abstraction than a particular programming 
language; most of  the models discussed in this series are associated with 
APIs that have been  implemented in multiple programming languages. </p>
  <p>In part, the richness of available XML programming models simply allows 
  programmers and projects to work in the ways that are most comfortable and
  familiar to them. In many ways, there is overlap--at least in achievable 
  outcomes--between all the XML programming models. However, different models 
 also  carry with them specific pros and cons in the context of XML manipulation; 
 and  these might urge the use of particular models for particular projects. 
 This  series of five articles aims to provide readers with an overview of 
 the costs,  benefits, and motivations for all of the major approaches to 
programmatic  manipulation of XML documents (manipulation here, should be 
understood also to  mean "using XML to drive or communicate other application 
processes").   </p>
  <p>This article addresses the Simple API for XML (SAX), which is an event-driven 
  and procedural style of XML programming. The previous article, Part 1, discussed
  the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a W3C Recommendation. Part 3
will  look  at XSLT, which brings a declarative programming style to transformations
 of XML  documents. In Part 4, we will see the application of full-fledged
 Functional  Programming (FP) techniques to XML manipulation--these in some
 ways unify the  earlier models (but are less commonly used). The final installment,
 Part 5, will  look briefly at a number of tools and techniques that did
not  quite fit into the  previous discussion, but that readers would do well
to  be aware of. </p>
  <h2>SAX's Conceptual Framework</h2>
  <p>There are a number of ways one can think about an XML document. A DOM 
  programmer imagines an XML document as a representation of a hierarchically 
  branching tree. In the DOM picture, each branch-point or leaf is a Node; 
 and  depending on exactly which type of Node it is, it gets written slightly 
  differently. For example, element Nodes get written like  <code>&lt;elem&gt;...&lt;/elem&gt;</code>
    , text nodes like <code>some  text</code> . But according to the Document 
 Object Model--as the name  suggests--every XML document is simply the description 
 of a complete object that  lives at a higher conceptual plane. </p>
  <p>When one thinks about OOP a lot, the DOM picture looks compelling. Everything 
  is an object, and objects do things like contain other objects and have 
 properties. At a conceptual level, SAX appeals more to programmers who are 
 used  to thinking about streams and sequences--events following one another 
 in strict  synchronous order. A SAX programmer imagines an XML document as
 a linear  sequence of discrete events, each one belonging to one of a small
 number of  event types. </p>
  <h3>Thinking on a Line </h3>
  <p>There are many programming tasks that effectively impose the linear thinking
 style of SAX. For example, readings from a physical instrument arrive in
a  particular sequence (or at least have a <em>logical</em> sequence), each
 corresponding to a time at which that physical state existed. A mouse or
 keyboard, for what it is worth, are physical instruments of certain sorts. 
 Or  financial transactions, similarly, exist as a linear sequence of events, 
 each of  which must be independently handled (perhaps depending on a state 
 that reflects  "past" transactions, but never on "future" ones). Processing 
 a logfile, or other  delimited or flat line-oriented data file, is also usually
 treated as a series  of distinct instructions or records. </p>
  <p>Of closest similarity to SAX is a language lexer--something that takes 
 a  sequence of symbols (bytes) from a source file, and groups them into larger
  aggregates (<em>tokens</em> such as keywords, strings, symbols, etc). In
 point  of fact, SAX is a <em>parser</em>, rather than merely a lexer; SAX
 creates  events that are slightly more structured than mere aggregations 
(but only  slightly). </p>
  <p>One needs to distinguish between SAX itself, and a SAX application. SAX
 (Simple API for XML) is, after all, an <em>API</em> not a tool or utility 
 in  itself. What SAX does is read a specified bytestream, then alert its 
controlling  application whenever one of 10 content events occur in the document. 
Technically  things are slightly more complicated since errors, entities and
notations can  also cause notices--but of the 10 content events only 3 are
almost always used,  2 are sometimes needed, and the 5 remaining ones are
largely "special purpose"  (I have never used those 5 for the practical applications
I have programmed).  </p>
  <h3>OOP, Structured Programming, and All That </h3>
  <p>SAX, technically speaking, is an object-oriented programming framework. 
 SAX  was first--and probably still most widely--implemented in Java, and 
that  language requires a certain degree of OOP-purity (aside from some minor 
warts  with simple types versus classes). Therefore, a SAX application will 
implement a  custom <code>Handler</code> class that specializes the base handlers
in the SAX  library, and provides methods corresponding to events. An instance
of the custom  handler is passed to the previously instantiated SAX parser.
From there, you are  "off to the races." </p>
  <p>The    <code> startElement()</code> , <code>endElement()</code> and
 <code>characters()</code>   methods are specialized by just about every
SAX  application. These methods, predictably, are  called when  an open tag,
close tag, and tag body, respectively are encountered.  Fairly  often, the
  <code>startDocument()</code> and <code> endDocument()</code>  methods 
are used for initialization and cleanup. But equally often, any  initialization
 or cleanup can occur at the application level rather than at the  document
 level (or the two are interchangeable). The remaining methods are  <code>
  startPrefixMapping()</code>, <code>endPrefixMapping()</code>,  <code>processingInstruction()</code>
, <code>ignorableWhitespace()</code>  and  <code>skippedEntity()</code>.
 These each have important reasons for being there,  but in practice are
used  less frequently. You can see that the naming  conventions use Java-style
word capitalization. </p>
  <p>The inheritance and interface design that goes into SAX is pretty nicely 
  thought out. But all the OOP stuff is also fairly irrelevant to the underlying 
  conceptual model of SAX. Having known method names, and providing abstract 
 base  classes, makes the programming a little bit easier. But the general 
 idea of  handing a bunch of callback operations to a parser is perfectly 
straightforward  in a non-OOP language. As an example, the very popular  <code>
expat</code>  XML parser is  written in C (not C++), and is  generally called
from a C application (although  wrappers for other languages  exist too).
  </p>
  <p>While the function names in <code>expat</code>  do not  precisely match
those in SAX, they are  conceptually close to each other.  Moreover, a number
of full-fledged SAX  libraries are built on top of the  underlying <code>
expat</code>  parser; the extra layer is fairly transparent  in this case.
As the  example below demonstrates, there is nothing stopping  a programmer
from using  the exact same names for callback functions with <code>expat</code>
     as she would  use for handler methods in SAX. In fact, doing this is
good  practice, in  general. </p>
  <p>At its heart, SAX is a structured programming style of thinking that 
 just  happens to have been implemented in an OOP language. </p>
  <h2>SAX At Work</h2>
  <p>Let us look at the same trivial XML processing application written in 
 several  programming languages. The first of these is Python. This version 
 is probably  the most readable (I like Python), and follows SAX OOP patterns 
 and naming accurately. A Java  version would look almost  identical. All
this application does--in all three  implementations--is write  out a canonical
version of the same XML document it  reads in. Sort of an  imperfect   <code>
cat</code>. The output might differ from  the input in respect to some whitespace
around attributes, and the loss of  comments and processing instructions.
Some character entities can become  confused also. It is not trying to be
a great application; but a better  application will   <em>look</em>   quite
similar to this simple one. </p>

  <p>A Perl version is largely similar. One thing to notice is that the Perl 
  implementation is, in a sense, not really SAX. That is,  <code>XML::Parser::PerlSAX</code>
    does not choose to use exactly the method  names defined by SAX proper. 
 Moreover, OOP in Perl is slightly circuitous  compared to languages that 
started out as object oriented. Nonetheless, it  should be clear that this 
version closely matches the Python one. </p>

  <p>Finally, to round out our view of SAX-like XML processing, let us look 
 at a  completely non-OOP application in C, and using <code> expat</code>
 as its parser.  The most notable feature of the  C <code>expat</code>  
  version is  that is looks almost exactly the same as the object oriented 
 SAX versions. Some  custom functions are used to setup callback functions 
 rather than calling a  method of a parser instance. But that is a very minor 
 spelling variant. </p>

  <h2>The Good <big>a</big>nd The Bad Of SAX</h2>
  <p>There are some technologies, certainly, that have a good concept but 
 a weak  implementation. SAX is not one of them; the design of SAX is a clean 
 and direct  approach to the problem it solves, and really cannot be significantly 
 improved  upon. Both the strengths and weaknesses of SAX (or, likewise, of
 <code>expat</code>   ) come directly  out of its paradigmatic model. </p>
  <p>The thing to emphasize about SAX is that it has no concept of an XML 
  document, as such. SAX knows about the small parts that make up an XML 
document--tags, attributes, bodies, etc.--but simply does not conceive of
 an XML  document as a unified thing, a single <em> data structure</em>.
DOM,  by  contrast, has a whole model of Nodes, children, values, and all
sorts  of useful  structural relations in an XML document. Likewise, the
declarative  statements  about   <em> documents</em> that we will see in
later installments  about XSLT and  functional programming techniques, conceive
of an XML document  as a data  structure to operate upon holistically. The
contrast between SAX  and these other  paradigms is really quite stark. </p>
  <p>Although SAX does allow one to specify validation of an input document, 
  validity is not really treated as a  <em>document</em> property. Instead, 
 the  violation of a validity constraint is just an event, not fundamentally 
 different  from a <code>startElement</code> event of a <code>character</code>
    event (this  event, however, is handled by means of an error or exception--but 
 that is an  implementational strategy, not paradigmatic). A SAX application 
 can do whatever  it wants with an "invalidity" event, including ignore it 
 entirely or infer a  valid variant. </p>
  <p>There are a couple situations where SAX (or a similar event-driven parser) 
 is  pretty well the <em>only</em> reasonable approach. Two clear cases are: 
 (1) When  an input XML document is sufficiently large (e.g., megabytes or 
 gigabytes; but  maybe mere kilobytes in embedded contexts) that creating 
an in-memory  representation of the entire document is infeasible. Moreover, 
 it should be  noted that a DOM representation of an XML document is generally 
 several times  the size of the underlying document. (2) When an input XML 
 document is not even  available all-at-once, but rather arrives over a channel 
 during a duration of  time (but you want to process the content as each portion
 is available). The  nice thing about SAX is that it can operate in a space-
 and time-constrained  context. Each sequential event can be processed as
it "occurs", with no  necessary reliance on future events (nor even necessarily
 on past events). There  is no need to read in an entire file at once for
SAX processing, nor does one  need to await the completion of a stream. </p>
  <p>The downside of SAX is also sometimes an upside. Since there is no data 
  structure of an XML document provided by SAX, if one <em>wants</em> to represent
  the document--or even just parts of it--in a SAX application, it is necessary
 to  allocate and create a custom data structure. DOM, by contrast, just
gives  you  the whole structure, along with a number of convenient methods
for operating  on  it. Building and populating a custom data structure is
generally much  more work  than is simply working with a DOM tree. At both
a design and an  implementation  stage there is a lot that can go wrong in
a large and complex  data structure  (DOM implementations have already been
debugged for you).    </p>
  <p>The SAX examples in the above source code were unrealistic in this 
respect--all  they  did was read  events then write them back out; most real-world
SAX applications will  accumulate various information contained in the various
events. Even something  as simple as the relative nesting of <code>startElement</code>
  events needs to  be kept in application-defined data structures (whether
this will be a stack,  tree, hash or something else depends on the requirement).
But there is a plus to  creating custom data structures in a SAX application--namely,
 they are  <em>custom</em> . A large amount of the time, a DOM-style tree
structure is the  relevant way to look at an XML document/stream. But not
always--at other times  what the application is interested in about an XML
stream is not its tree, but  some different aggregation of the information
in the event stream. In such  cases--even apart from the memory and latency
issues--SAX is the right approach,  precisely <em>because</em> one needs
to build a custom data structure. Under a  DOM approach, what a programmer
winds up doing is first building a DOM tree,  than "walking" that tree to
extract a brand new data structure with the needed  characteristics. SAX
bypasses the extra step.   </p>
