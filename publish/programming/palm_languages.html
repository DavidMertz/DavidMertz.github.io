<blockquote>    When most people who think of it at all think of developing
    PalmOS application, they imagine writing C/C++ code on a
    desktop, then cross-compiling to the PalmOS.  But, there is a
    whole other approach to PalmOS development.  The products we
    look at in this article are all complete programming
    languages and development environments that can run entirely
    on a Palm handheld, all the way from program editing to final
    run.  For mobile programmers, new possibilities are opened by
    these tools.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">Introduction</strong></p>
 <p>  At first brush, the compact physical form of a PalmOS handheld
  leads one to think of it a device dedicated to a few
  pre-packaged applications.  But appearances can be deceiving. A
  PalmOS handheld is actually a moderately powerful computer in
  its own right--with more memory and CPU power than many early
  computers the authors, and readers, have used and owned (and
  more than many embedded systems).  In fact, using the right
  tools, a PalmOS handheld can act as a complete program
  development environment--allowing customization of application
  functionality without the need for a desktop PC.
</p>
<p>  The Palm is a rather unusual device for people used to
  programming desktop computers--whether MacOS, Windows,
  Unix/Linux, or other environments.  In a lot of ways, the
  architecture will be more familiar to embedded programmers.  In
  particular, in almost ironic juxtoposition to the Unix
  philosophy of "everything is a file," the PalmOS wholly lacks
  the concept of a file.  This means that there are no special
  files for STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR.  But, even more
  interestingly, it means that there are no <em>files</em> in which to
  store source code for interpretation/compilation.  The route
  most of the development environments we look at take to this
  "problem" of missing files is twofold.  On the one hand, most
  PalmOS-hosted IDEs have their own mini-editors to run one-shot
  code (sort of like one-liners in Perl or other script
  languages).  But, on the other hand, most of these IDEs utilize
  the PalmOS Memo Pad to compose persistent programs.  Program
  source "files" are identified by Memo Pad category and/or by
  special memo naming conventions.
</p>
<p>  After looking at Pippy in another article (see Resources), we
  were particularly curious about how different PalmOS programming
  environments handled floating point and various higer-order
  mathematical functions (Pippy came up short here).  We were also
  interested in the types of input and output (e.g. forms)
  provided by different environments.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">HotPaw Basic</strong></p>
 <p>  HotPaw Basic is one of the two Basic implementations we'll look
  at in this article.  HotPaw claims to implement over 95% of the
  ANSI/ISO Basic Programming Language Standard.  As well, HotPaw
  supports most GW-Basic functions and statements.  As with other
  modern versions of Basic, HotPaw uses structured programming
  constructs rather than the old-fashioned line numbers and GOTOs
  (beloved by one of the present authors).  HotPaw supports
  color; custom forms and dialogs; serial, IR, and IP
  communication; access to several database formats; and both
  double precision and transcendental mathematical functions
  (using the LGPL <code>MathLib.prc</code>, which is also used by other
  programming environments).
</p>
<p>  There is a short tutorial on HotPaw and some examples available
  at the HotPaw website.  We found it easy to install and use
  HotPaw.  Knowing a little Basic opens the possibility of
  writing your own PalmOS applications for the Palm, on the Palm.
  In order to install HotPaw, you will need to install the file
  <code>yBasic.prc</code> by the means usual to your desktop platform.  You
  will probaby also want to install <code>MathLib.prc</code> (version 1.1+),
  which you need to obtain from a separate site (see Resources).
  <code>yBasic.prc</code> itself is the virtual machine which allows you to
  run either source code files from Memo Pad or bytecode compiled
  applications (the applications can have their own icon, and run
  without the HotPaw interactive interface).  The distribution
  has a few extra helpers and samples, but they are not strictly
  required.
</p>
<p>  One of the nicest things about HotPaw is nice form support.
  You can use the <code>form()</code> function to define a few basic
  parameterized input/output forms.  This makes it easy to make a
  PalmOS GUI, at least for simple applications.  With a little
  bit more work--but not too much--you can create more customized
  forms, and even output graphical elements to the screen (lines,
  shapes, pictures).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">SmallBASIC</strong></p>
 <p>  SmallBASIC is another Basic environment, this one under GPL
  license and also available for Linux/SVGALib and Linux/SDL
  environments.  Like most of the development environments we
  review, SmallBASIC is a code interpreter, rather than a native
  compiler.  SmallBASIC echos the feel of 1986--it refers to
  "files" and VGA colors, it uses line numbers and GOTOs, and it
  even recreates the F-KEY prompts of IBM-PC ROM BASIC.  All this
  may sound crude, but actually SmallBASIC has one of the better
  development interfaces of the IDEs reviewed here.  Even though
  there is no filesystem on the PalmOS, SmallBASIC's
  sophisticated built-in source code editor uses menu options for
  "File Save", "Save As", "Close", and "Open".  This built-in
  editor allows for larger documents than Memo Pad supports, it
  has "search", "goto line" and "search again" options, clipboard
  support, and an unique online help system.
</p>
<p>  Installing SmallBASIC is pretty much the same as installing
  HotPaw. You just install the <code>sbpad.prc</code> and <code>MathLib.prc</code>
  files that come with the distribution archive.  After that, run
  SmallBASIC from its icon, and create and run scripts using the
  SmallBASIC interface.  We do wish that SmallBASIC was a bit
  stronger on documentation--like many free software projects--or
  at least on English language documentation (Greek and Japanese
  are better supported).
</p>
<p>  SmallBASIC supports a good variety of functions; mostly the
  same ones as GW-BASIC and QBASIC, actually.  You can draw
  graphic primitives to screen, create sounds, output texts in
  different fonts, get keyboard input, and basically everything
  you need for a useful application.  We do wish that the
  underlying language used more modern structured programming
  techniques (OOP and FP are two much to wish for), but
  SmallBASIC is still a good way to quickly write ad hoc
  Palm-hosted applications.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">PocketC</strong></p>
 <p>  PocketC is a C-like language for the PalmOS, with versions of
  the same compiler available for Win32 and WinCE.  The Win32
  "Desktop" version lets you target PalmOS and WinCE handhelds.
  But we are interested in the Palm-hosted version here.  PocketC
  operates much like most of the languages we have looked at in
  that it provides its own runtime environment, which amounts to
  a virtual machine to interpret PocketC compiled bytecodes.  The
  language is basically C, but a number of functions for the
  Palm, and a few C++ syntax conventions were added.  You <em>do</em>
  also get some features typical of bytecode languages, such as a
  string data type and garbage collection.  Being a PalmOS
  application, some extra functions for graphics, sounds,
  database I/O, and form I/O are included in the "standard
  library."  Writing an application consists largely of calling
  these Palm-specific functions, but with flow control in a
  familiar C style.
</p>
<p>  The environment for PocketC is generally similar to the other
  IDEs we have looked at.  As with those, the Memo Pad is used to
  store source code.  You can even use the Memo Pad to store
  <code>#include</code> headers.  Unlike some of the "fully interpreted"
  languages, PocketC requires a separate compilation step before
  you can run an application; but you can do this compilation
  right within the same interface (and when you do it once, the
  bytecode sticks around).  One nice touch to PocketC's
  interaction with the Memo Pad is that if there is a source code
  error, PocketC gives you the opportunity to jump straight to
  the error and highlights it.
</p>
<p>  While PocketC is nice for C programmers, it seems to us that C
  is inherently more verbose than this niche requires.  The
  high-level functions, string types, and garbage collection of
  PocketC save a bit of code length.  But if you need those
  features (which you <em>do</em> want for Palm-hosted quick application
  development), why not use a language like Basic, Scheme or
  Python, rather than one whose syntax is designed around
  low-level efficiency?  Nonetheless, PocketC is quite nicely
  done, and tastes in programming languages are largely a matter
  of personal faith and devotion.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">OnBoard C</strong></p>
 <p>  OnBoard C really aims at a different target than the other
  development environments we review.  It supports true native
  compilation of source code to PRC executables or HackMaster
  hacks, rather than using a virtual machine and bytecodes.
  Moreover, OnBoard C is a real project-based IDE, with a choice
  of source code and resource editors, and the ability to include
  a variety of "files" in a given project.  The source code
  editors supported by OnBoard C include pedit, pedit32, QED and
  SmartEdit; of course, you can just use Memo Pad too.  The
  applications you create with OnBoard C can, therefore, be
  distributed without including any sort of runtime or library
  (other than the Palm ROM's API).
</p>
<p>  Developers who use OnBoard C will usually also want to get
  RsrcEdit, which is a resource editor.  RsrcEdit allows you to
  create forms, text strings, bitmaps, menus, and other GUI
  elements you might want to call from your OnBoard C
  applications.  Like OnBoard C, RsrcEdit is entirely
  Palm-hosted.
</p>
<p>  Developers whom OnBoard C appeals to will generally be people
  who are already pretty familiar with the ins-and-outs of PalmOS
  development--it is not as good for people who just want to bang
  out a quick custom application.  Obviously, you get a lot
  faster applications, and a lot more low-level control, using
  ONBoard C than you will with other IDEs that are Palm-hosted.
  The price for speed and control is verbose and explicit source
  code, and the need to hand-tweak resources.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Poplet Kit</strong></p>
 <p>  The Poplet Kit is an interesting creature.  Most of the IDEs
  reviewed here are basically full-cycle write/compile/run
  environments.  Poplet Kit, however, does not allow you to <em>run</em>
  scripts within its environment (nor is it meaningful to do so,
  in most cases).  Instead, each "poplet" that is created and
  enabled within Poplet Kit adds enhanced capabilities to <em>every</em>
  PalmOS application.  This is much like what HackMaster hacks
  do, but with a friendly and interpreted language.  To call a
  poplet in an application, you just call up the PalmOS Command
  Bar. For many poplets, whatever text is highlighted will act
  as the input for the poplet (e.g. computing a calculated
  expression, or reformatting some selected text).
</p>
<p>  The language of Poplet Kit is called Handscript, and is similar
  to Javascript.  The OOP features of Javascript are left out,
  but the syntax and function semantics are the same.  Some
  modularity is added by grouping functions into poplets.  As
  well, a few shortcut commands for using PalmOS features are
  added.  Basically, if you know Javascript, Handscript will be
  easy to work with.
</p>
<p>  The interface for Poplet Kit is well done.  A number of views
  of your poplets are presented, similar to the different views
  in an application like DateBook+.  In one area you can read
  documentation about a poplet; in another you can browse
  functions; in another you can edit function definitions.  You
  can also quickly enable or disable each of the installed
  poplets (a good sample collection comes with the system).
</p>
<p>  Even though Poplet Kit might strike one as a mere system
  enhancement rather than a programming environment, the programs
  you can run using Poplet Kit are just as general as with the
  other languages/IDEs. You can input anything you want by
  highlighting relevant inputs, and anything can be output to the
  active application and/or presented in dialogs.  In terms of
  practical usage and interaction with the rest of your Palm,
  Poplet Kit even shines above the other IDEs.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Conclusion</strong></p>
 <p>  Check out Michael Winikoff's page (see Resources) for even more
  Palm-hosted IDE's than we looked at.  Some "exotic languages"
  like Forth and Lua are included in the list.  We did make a
  start at looking at the environment LispMe, which is a Scheme
  for the PalmOS.  Unfortunately, at least on our test platforms,
  LispMe was too unstable to really examine (constant resets);
  this might be a problem with particular ROM/OS versions.  But
  those we have not yet looked at might still interest readers.
