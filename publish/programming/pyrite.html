<blockquote>    The Pyrite Project has created several related tools to allow
    Python programmers to access and control PalmOS handheld
    devices.  Pyrite is used to communicate with and manage the
    data help on Palm devices; Pyrite Publisher is used to create
    and distribute Doc format e-books to Palm devices.  This
    article discusses David's experience in working with Pyrite
    tools, their underlying architecture, and tips for effective
    use of the Pyrite tools.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">What Is The Pyrite Project?</strong></p>
 <p>  We suppose our reader is like us in the following three ways.
  You have a brand new PalmOS handheld that promises to do all
  sorts of neat things.  Your OS of choice is Linux.  And, you
  want to transform documents that you can access from within
  your Linux environment into documents that you can access with
  your PalmOS handheld, and maybe even programmatically
  manipulate the record database on your Palm.  The Pyrite
  Project provides this set of tools; we will focus, in this
  article, on the portion dubbed Pyrite Publisher that deals with
  document conversions.
</p>
<p>  While the Pyrite Project has some promise, and addresses some
  important needs, it unfortunately still has a lot of rough
  edges.  We will try to walk you through the problems you are
  likely to encounter.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">What You Will Need</strong></p>
 <p>  Pyrite Publisher is written in Python, and depends on some code
  provided by yet another pair of packages called Pilot-Link and
  Pyrite.  Consequently, you will need the following five things.
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>1. Python 1.5.2, or greater.
2. The development headers for Python.
3. A C compiler -- gcc worked for us.
4. The pilot-link library, 0.8.11 or greater.
5. The header files from pilot-link.
6. The development headers from pyrite

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  We will assume that you don't need help with (1), (2) or (3).
  There are two ways to get (4) and (5).  Both methods will get
  you the needed header files and libraries.
</p>
<p>  The first method employs RPM.  Goto<a href="http://www.rpmfind.net,">http://www.rpmfind.net,</a> and
  download the RPMs for pilot-link and pilot-link-devel.  If
  you're using RedHat 7.0, these two links should take you to
  precisely what you need.  The first will get you the headers,
  and the second will get you the libraries.  See the Resources
  section below for links to these RPMs.
</p>
<p>  The second method is for those of you who don't have access to, or
  don't want to use RPM. Simply, download pilot-link, and install by
  hand.  Download the source (see Resources).  Use the standard
  procedures to install, namely:
</p>
<p><strong>bash session for installing pilot-link source</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ tar zxvf pilot-link.0.9.3.tar.gz
$ cd pilot-link.0.9.3
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make intsall

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  To get the development headers from Pyrite first download the
  source (see Resources).  Next, do the following:
</p>
<p><strong>bash session for installing Pyrite source</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ tar zxvf pyrite-0.9.3.tar.gz
$ cd pyrite-0.9.3
$ ./configure
$ make

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  One of the <code>Makefile's has an error, so use your favorite
  editor to open 'i18n/Makefile</code>. On line 26, change:
</p>
<p><strong>Required fix for Makefile error</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
# mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(LOCALEDIR) ;
mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(LOCALEDIR) ; \

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Otherwise, you will get the following error message:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>make[1]: Entering directory
`/root/PAPERS/palm-stuff/pyrite-0.9.3/i18n'
if [ "yes" = "yes" ]; then \
mkdir -p /usr/share/locale ;
/bin/sh: -c: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file
make[1]: *** [install] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/PAPERS/palm-stuff/pyrite-0.9.3/i18n'
make: *** [install] Error 2

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Finally, run <code>make install</code>.
</p>
<p>  You now have all the header files and libraries that you need
  to install Pyrite Publisher.
</p>
<h3>OTHER INSTALLATION ISSUES (Slackware, Mandrake)

</h3> <p>  We encountered several problems installing the Pyrite libraries
  and headers on our Mandrake 7.1 system.  These issues are not
  directly Pyrite's fault, but you might find you have to install
  a few dependencies on your system.  First, <code>configure</code>
  complained that it couldn't find the python config makefile.
  We downloaded a suitable python-dev RPM, which we downloaded
  and installed with no trouble (see Resource).
</p>
<p>  Next, <code>configure</code> complained that it couldn't find the
  pilot-link library.  We knew that pilot-link was installed, and
  that we had /usr/lib/libpisock.so.3 and
  /usr/lib/libpisock.so.3.0.1.  But, we didn't have a generic
  <code>libpisock</code>.  This was resolved by creating the following link
  in /usr/lib:
</p>
<p><strong>Creating an non-numbered libpisock.so link</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ ln -s libpisock.so.3.0.1 libpisock.so

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Subseqently, <code>configure</code> complained that it couldn't find the
  pilot-link library.  So, we searched rpmfind for the
  appropriate pilot-link-devel-*.rpm.  However, we encountered
  the infamous "only packages with major numbers &lt;= 3 are
  supported by this version of RPM".  So, we used the force:
  we got the source (see Resource).  Then, we did the following:
</p>
<p><strong>bash session for installing pilot-link headers</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ tar zxvf pilot-link-0.9.3.tar.gz
$ pilot-link/include
$ cp * /usr/local/include

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Finally, <code>configure</code> was happy.  And <code>make</code> ran fine.  We
  thought that we were on our way, but <code>make install</code> died
  because of the already mentioned typographical error in
  <code>pyrite-0.9.3/i18n/Makefile</code>.  We made the change described
  above, and even <code>make install</code> worked.
</p>
<p>  On our Slackware 7.1 system, python-dev was installed by
  default, but pilot-link was not.  Pilot-link needed to be
  configured with the <code>--without-cpp</code> option.  Our glibc and gcc
  had been upgraded from the 7.1 default, which may or may not
  have led to this option being required.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Aside On Pyrite</strong></p>
 <p>  Pyrite-0.9.3 provides a library that can be used to write Python code
  that will communicate with a PalmOS device. If you are a Palm user who
  has made it to this document, you will more likely than not
  also be a user who will eventually want to write such code.  If
  so, you will be in luck, because you will have the resources to
  do it.
</p>
<p>  One valuable source of information is to be found in
  <code>pyrite-0.9.3/doc/prg/html/book1.html</code>, which is the root of
  the Pyrite Programmers Guide.  Pyrite depends on another
  library called Sulfur, and there is helpful documentation to be
  found in <code>pyrite-0.9.3/Sulfur/doc/html/book1.html</code>, which is
  the root of the Sulfur Programmers Guide.  The relation between
  Pyrite and Sulfur can be better understood by noting that as
  Rob Tillotson developed Pyrite, he found that he had also been
  developing code that was useful outside the context of palm
  applications.  This code became Sulfur.
</p>
<p>  In or under pyrite-0.9.3, you will find the following five Python
  modules with their various classes.
</p>
<blockquote>    1. <code>Blocks.py</code>:
       Block, Record, AppBlock, CategoryAppBlock, SortBlock,
       Resource, and PrefBlock
</blockquote><blockquote>    2. <code>Database.py</code>:
       Database, Slice, and CategoryIterator
</blockquote><blockquote>    3. <code>Store/Store.py</code>:
       BaseStore and Store
</blockquote><blockquote>    4. <code>Application/Application.py</code>:
       Application, PyriteState, and PyriteCLIAppContext
</blockquote><blockquote>    5. <code>Conduit/Conduit.py</code>:
       Conduit
</blockquote><p>  Blocks and Database are imported along with Pyrite, but Store,
  Application and Conduit are not., There are also additional
  modules, classes and methods, but the listed ones received the
  vast majority of the attention in the documentation.  In this
  context, we will only summarize these modules and some of their
  methods.
</p>
<p>  Block objects represent and transform data to and from PalmOS
  and Python readable states.  For example, Python stores the
  time in a tuple, and a palm stores the time in the form of two
  packed bytes.  Suppose we want the time 10 hours, 30 minutes,
  and 0 seconds.  Then,
</p>
<p><strong>Python code for creating a Palm date</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>
from</B></FONT> Pyrite <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> Blocks
time_tuple = (10, 30, 0)
palm_time = Blocks.tuple_to_palm_date(time_tuple)

</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  will put 4032 in <code>palm_time</code>, which is the way that a Palm
  internally represents the time.
</p>
<p>  A Database object is an accessable database with an <code>.append()</code>
  method, a <code>.new_record()</code> method, a <code>.delete()</code> method, and a
  <code>.next_record()</code> method.  This is all quite interesting stuff,
  but it also goes quite beyond our aim here.  We refer our
  readers to the above cited resources.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Installing Pyrite Publisher</strong></p>
 <p>  Of course, begin by downloading the source (see Resource).
  Then, do the following:
</p>
<p><strong>bash session for installing Pyrite Publisher</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ tar zxvf pyrite-publisher-1.99.0.tar.gz
$ cd pyrite-publisher-1.99.0
$ python setup.py install

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  One would hope that this is all that you needed to do.
  Unfortunately, this is not true.  There are several more
  poblems with Pyrite Publisher.  Here is how we resolved them.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Some More Fixes</strong></p>
 <p>  Again, Pyrite Publisher promises to transform documents into files
  that can be uploaded to and read on a PalmOS handheld.
  Unfortunately, Pyrite Publisher doesn't do what it is supposed
  to do right out of the box.  We found that we needed to make
  several fixes before we could get it working.  For someone with
  no knowledge of Python, this is really a big problem.  The
  following code changes will allow you to fix Pyrite Publisher
  just enough to transform a document such as an html document
  into a form that can be uploaded to a PalmOS handheld, and then
  read them conveniently on a train or in a cafe.
</p>
<p>  Several changes are needed to <code>PyritePublisher/plugin_HTML.py</code>.  In
  <code>Plugin.eof()</code>, on line 79, change:
</p>
<p><strong>Required fix for plugin_HTML.py (1)</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># self.fmt.add_flowing_data(p.anchorlist[x])</FONT>
self.fmt.add_flowing_data(self.parser.anchorlist[x])

</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  On line 99 (same class), change:
</p>
<p><strong>Required fix for plugin_HTML.py (2)</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># DocToolkit.entitydefs import entitydefs</FONT>
PyritePublisher.entitydefs <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> entitydefs

</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  The next fix is to <code>PyritePublisher/plugin_TealDoc.py</code>.  On
  line 32, change:
</p>
<p><strong>Required fix for plugin_TealDoc.py</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># DocToolkit import metrics</FONT>
PyritePublisher <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> metrics

</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Apparently, these changes were necessary since the authors of
  this project failed to remember that they had changed the name
  of their project <em></em> big time ouch.
</p>
<p>  The next fix is to <code>PyritePublisher/doc_database.py</code>. In
  <code>DocWriteStream.close()</code>, on line 135, change:
</p>
<p><strong>Required fix for doc_database.py</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<PRE>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># db.setRecord(0x40, uid, 0, bookmark_pack(t,p))</FONT>
db.setRecord(0x40, uid, 0, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'THIS IS A TEST STRING'</FONT>)

</PRE>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  This last fix is undoubtably a really ugly hack, but our goal
  here is not to beutify code.  Our fix has the strange side
  effect of inserting odd looking bookmarks into our pdb files,
  which appear as a series of y's with umlauts.  Apparently, the
  function <code>bookmark_pack()</code> is intended to create Palm-style
  bookmarks, but the function is missing, and we are not sure of
  the exact format.  With this hack you can transform documents
  on your Linux machine into documents that you can read on your
  PalmOS handheld.  Hopefully the authors will create or restore
  the needed function.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">How To Use Pyrite Publisher</strong></p>
 <p>  Using Pyrite Publisher is relatively simple.  In
  <code>pyrite-publisher-1.99.0/PyritePublisher</code>, you will find
  <code>pyrpub</code>.  Supposing that the document that you want to
  transform into PalmOS readable form is <code>file.html</code>, the command
  is simply:
</p>
<p><strong>Converting an HTML file to PalmDoc</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ ./pyrpub file.html

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  You will find a file named <code>file.pdb</code>, which can be read by a Palm.
  The next step is how to get <code>file.pdb</code> on your PalmOS handheld.
  You can use a nifty program that comes with pilot-link called
  <code>pilot-xfer</code>.  Assuming that you have connected your Palm to
  <code>/dev/cua1</code>, issue the following command:
</p>
<p><strong>Transfering the PalmDoc file to the Palm</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
$ pilot-xfer /dev/cua1 -i file.pdb

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Then, press your hot-button on your craddle. Actually, you will be
  instructed to do this on the command line. Then, you will find
  <code>file.pdb</code> on your Palm.
</p>
<p>  A limitation of Pyrite Publisher is that it doesn't directly
  convert PDF or Postscipt files to pdb files.  Luckily, there is
  a simple workaround for this.  The utility <code>pstotext</code>
  can transform a Postscipt file into a text file.  To
  generate a pdb file, first transform the ps file into a text
  file, and then use Pyrite Publisher to convert the text file
  into a pdb file.  If the file that you want to transform into a
  pdb file is a PDF file, first use <code>pdf2pdf</code> to transform the PDF
  file into a postscript file, and then proceded as describe
  above.  Unfortunately, this isn't a foolproof method, since
  <code>pstotext</code> and <code>pdf2ps</code> aren't entirely reliable, but when they
  work, you be able to generate pdb files.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Other Things</strong></p>
 <p>  To find packages related to the Pyrite libraries and Pyrite Publisher,
  try searching Freshmeat.  We think that you might want to look
  at some of the following packages.
</p>
<blockquote>    * There is KVM, the K Vitural machine, and the Connected Limited Device
      Configuration, CLDC. This is a package that lets you write palm
      applications that can be run on X11.
</blockquote><blockquote>    * Kpilot makes it possible for your palm to exchange data with your
      Linux box. Kpilot uses plugins to exchange data between your Palm and
      other applications like KOrganizer or POP3/SMTP mail servers. Using
      Kpilot, you can read and edit documents install new programs on your
      palm.
</blockquote><blockquote>    * Jan Schaumann has done some interesting things with the palm within
      the context of the Linux OS.
</blockquote><blockquote>    * Plucker also enables the Linux user to read HTML documents
      offline.  Plucker claims to support clickable images,
      italics, multiple databases, configurable display
      parameters and stylus options, compression, and Python
      conduits and parsers.
</blockquote><blockquote>    * DataViz' <cite>Documents To Go</cite> is a sophisticated document conversion
      package, but only for Win32 and MacOS. If you happen to use these
      platforms, you can convert document formats such as MS-Word, MS-Excel,
      Word-Perfect, PDF, and others. You can even edit documents in many of
      these formats on your Palm. Of course, you have to pay $50 for it.
</blockquote><p>  For links to information about these packages, see Resources below.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Summary</strong></p>
 <p>  We like the concept behind the Pyrite Project, but we are sorry that
  the truth is that it doesn't quite live up to its promises. Pyrite
  Publisher sort of works, but only if you know enough Python and system
  administration to fix it, and even after it is fixed to the point of
  doing some work, it still has an overly large collection of weird bugs.
  There is also the problem that Pyrite Publisher doesn't
  directly convert Postscript and PDF files.  We are not totally
  negative, however, since it clearly seems to be on the cusp of
  fulfilling its aim.  We hope that Rob Tillotson and company
  will continue with the Pyrite Project.  Linux-using Palm owners
  can certainly use it.
