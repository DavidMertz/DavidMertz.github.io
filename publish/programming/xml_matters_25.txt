Doing Better than W3C XML Schemas

    RELAX NG Schemas provide a more powerful, more concise, and
    semantically more straightforward means of describing classes
    of valid XML instances than do W3C XML Schemas.  The virtue
    of RELAX NG is that it extends the well proven semantics of
    DTDs while allowing orthogonally extensible datatypes and
    easy composition of related instance models.

WISHES AND FISHES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I have long been wary of W3C XML Schema, and to some extent of
  XML itself. A jumble of companies and groups with divergent
  interests and backgrounds cobbled together W3C XML Schema by
  throwing in a little bit of everything each party wanted,
  creating a typical designed-by-committee, difficult to
  understand, standard. In fact, my reservations have been
  sufficient that I generally recommend sticking with DTDs for
  validation needs, and filling any gaps strictly at an application
  level.

  About a month ago, however, I started taking a serious look at
  RELAX NG. Like many readers, I had heard of this alternative
  schema language before that, but I had assumed that RELAX NG
  would be pretty much more of the same, with slightly different
  spellings.  How wrong I was.  RELAX NG is simply better than
  either W3C XML Schemas or DTDs in nearly every way! In fact,
  RELAX NG's ability to support unordered (or semi-ordered)
  content models answers most of my prior concerns about the
  mismatch between the semantic models of OOP datatypes and the
  linearity of XML elements.

  This article is the first of three _XML Matters_ installments
  discussing RELAX NG.  This installment will look at the general
  semantics of RELAX NG, and touch on datatyping.  The next
  installment will look at tools and libraries for working with
  RELAX NG.  The final installment will discuss the RELAX NG
  compact syntax in more detail.

SEMANTIC MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The semantics of RELAX NG are enormously straightforward--in this
  respect, they are a natural extension of DTD semantics. What a
  RELAX NG schema describes is -patterns- consisting of
  quantifications, orderings, and alternations. As well, RELAX NG
  introduces a pattern for unordered collection, which neither DTDs
  nor W3C XML Schemas support (SGML does, but less flexibly than
  RELAX NG). Moreover, RELAX NG treats elements and attributes in
  an almost uniform manner. Element/attribute uniformity
  corresponds much better with the conceptual space of XML than
  does the rigid separation in both DTDs and W3C XML Schemas.  In
  actual design, the choice between use of an attribute and an
  element body is frequently underdetermined by design
  considerations and/or is contextually sensitive.

  The quantifications available to RELAX NG are identical to those
  in DTDs. Any pattern may be conditioned as '<oneOrMore>,
  '<zeroOrMore>', or '<optional>'; these correspond to the DTD
  quantifiers '+', '*' and '?' (also used in regular expressions
  and elsewhere). In fact, the RELAX NG compact syntax are the very
  same quantifiers as used in DTDs. Admittedly, these very general
  quantifiers make it more difficult to state specific cardinality
  constraints, as you can with W3C XML Schema 'minOccurs' and
  'maxOccurs' attributes. I would not mind seeing a later revision
  of RELAX NG that incorporated more flexible cardinality
  constraints. However, it is easier to work around these limits
  using named patterns than it is to do so in DTDs.

  Ordering multiple patterns is just a matter listing the patterns
  in an order. But a sequence of patterns at the same level can be
  given a different semantics using the '<choice>', '<group>' or
  '<interleave>' elements. The '<group>' tag is used in just the
  same way that parentheses are in DTDs. By itself, a '<group>'
  element doesn't mean anything, but when used inside '<choice>' or
  '<interleave>' elements, a "group" acts as one pattern rather
  than several. The '<choice>' element expresses simple alternation
  between contained patterns. The '<interleave>' element, however,
  lets you intersperse patterns, while obeying the cardinality of
  each contained pattern. For example, suppose a library patron has
  a name, id number, and possibly some checked out books--for these
  purposes, we do not care which order the features are listed in.
  A book, in turn, can be identified by either title or ISBN (but
  not both, perhaps an unrealistic example) . A RELAX NG
  description could look like:

      #-------------- Libary Patron Schema ---------------------#
      <element name="patron"
               xmnln="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
        <interleave>
          <element name="name"><text/></element>
          <element name="id-num"><text/></element>
          <zeroOrMore>
            <element name="book">
              <choice>
                <attribute name="isbn"/>
                <attribute name="title"/>
              </choice>
            </element>
          </zeroOrMore>
        </interleave>
      </element>

  Understanding this schema is almost just a matter of reading it
  aloud.  But let us first look at the compact syntax that
  corresponds to this XML syntax:

      #-------------- Libary Patron Compact Syntax--------------#
      element patron {
        element name { text }   &
        element id-num { text } &
        element book {
          (attribute isbn { text } |
           attribute title { text } )
        }*
      }

  You actually *cannot* describe the valid partron records using
  either DTDs or W3C XML Schemas, at least not without elaborate
  contortions and/or compromises in precision.  For example, here
  are two valid records:

      #--------------- Valid Patron Records --------------------#
      <patron>
        <book isbn="0-528-84460-X"/>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <id-num>12345678</id-num>
        <book title="Why RELAX is Clever"/>
      </patron>
      <patron>
        <id-num>09876545</id-num>
        <name>Jane Moe</name>
      </patron>

  But the below is invalid in a way that other schemata cannot
  generically describe (attributes can only be optional or
  required in DTDs/W3C Schema, not interrelated):

      #--------------- Invalid Patron Records ------------------#
      <patron>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <id-num>12345678</id-num>
        <book title="Why RELAX is Clever" isbn="0-528-84460-X"/>
        <book/>
      </patron>

  Moreover, the ability of a RELAX NG schema to define an unordered
  collection of name, id number, and book(s) answers my
  complaint--when discussing YAML, and elsewhere--that XML imposes
  arbitrary order on data that is not inherently sequential.

  An interesting upshot of the general behavior of interleaving is
  that you can mix text/PCDATA sections with subelements, and
  control the number (cardinality) of text blocks allowed.  For
  example you could allow only one continguous flow of PCDATA to
  occur -anywhere- among some optional or required tags.

UNIFORMITY OF ATTRIBUTES AND ELEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A quite common usage scenario for XML is a element that can
  contain -either- a special attribute -or- a collection of
  subelements (or a PCDATA content), but not both (all).  For
  example, the [gnosis.xml.pickle] serialization format defines
  heterogeneous lists similar to:

      #-------- gnosis.xml.pickle-ish list fragment ------------#
      <list>
        <item type="string" value="Bar"/>
        <item type="list">
          <item type="numeric" value="17"/>
          <item type="None"/> <!-- None is singleton w/o value -->
        </item>
      </list>

  A given '<item>' contains subelements only if it does not
  contain a 'value' attribute, and vice versa.  Using a DTD, we
  could approximate the rule as:

      #--------------- Approximate DTD for pickle --------------#
      <!ELEMENT list (item+)>
      <!ELEMENT item (item*)>
      <!ATTLIST item
          type  (None | string | numeric | list) #REQUIRED
          value CDATA #IMPLIED >

  That DTD will match the prior XML instance document, but it
  will also falsely match:

      #------------- Invalid false-match to DTD ----------------#
      <list>
        <item type="None" value="Some">
          <item type="string" value="More"/>
        </item>
        <item type="list"/>
      </list>

  A W3C XML Schema is enormously arcane to start with, but in the
  end has no ability to describe anything more specific than the
  DTD does, for this case.  For example, the following is a
  schema for the simplified case where an '<item>' may simply
  contain PCDATA, rather than subelements:

        #------------ Approximate W3C XML Schema ---------------#
        <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
        <xsd:element name="list">
          <xsd:element name="item" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded">
            <xsd:complexType>
              <xsd:simpleContent>
                <xsd:extension base="xsd:string">
                  <xsd:attribute name="type" type="xsd:string"/>
                  <xsd:attribute name="value" type="xsd:string"
                                 use="xsd:optional"/>
                </xsd:extension>
              </xsd:simpleContent>
            </xsd:complexType>
          </xsd:element>
        </xsd:element>

  The problem here with both DTDs and W3C XML Schemas is that
  they make attibutes too special, and treat them very
  differently from elements.  RELAX NG, on the other hand is
  uniform (the simplified case of PCDATA is presented here to
  skip named patterns, for now):

      #---------- RELAX NG XML syntax for pickle ---------------#
      <element name="list" xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0>
        <oneOrMore>
          <element name="item">
            <choice>
              <text/>
              <attribute name="value"/>
            </choice>
          </element>
        </oneOrMore>
      </elment>

  In compact syntax, we could write:

      #---------- RELAX NG compact syntax for pickle -----------#
      element list { element item { attribute type {text},
                            (attribute value {text} | {text}) }+ }

NAMED PATTERNS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Nested (and context sensitive) definitions of subpatterns are
  only one style available in RELAX NG.  You may also work with
  named patterns within a grammar.  Moreover, by using a grammar,
  a RELAX NG schema can explicitly indicate a root element for
  validation.  A grammar contains a root '<grammar>' element, a
  single '<start>' element, and zero or more '<define>' elements.
  Notably, '<define>' elements can contain recursive elements.

  A sample grammar illustrates how definitions and references are
  used.  Let uso define the nested '<item>' tags that were
  skipped over in the above examples:

      #------- Improved RELAX NG grammer for pickle ------------#
      <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0>
        <start>
          <element name="list">
            <ref name="items"/>
          </element>
        </start>
        <define name="items">
          <oneOrMore>
            <element name="item">
              <choice>
                <ref name="items"/>
                <attribute name="value"/>
              </choice>
            </element>
          </oneOrMore>
        </define>
      </grammar>

  And this finally gives us an accurate validation constraint for
  the attribute-or-subelements serialization form described
  above.  For a real-life case, we would typically define more
  named patterns than this; each can freely refer to others
  (within quantifications, choices, and so on).

DATATYPES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While W3C XML Schemas have a complex collection of datatypes
  built in, and DTDs effectively have no datatyping at all, RELAX
  NG allows a completely modular and expandable datatyping system.
  Most commonly, RELAX NG users will simply use the entire
  collection of datatypes that accompany W3C XML Schemas.  As
  with a specification of a namespace, a datatype library is
  found in the most immediate surrounding element that defines
  the attribute 'datatypeLibrary'.  So, for example, you -could-
  define the datatype library with every data value:

      #---------- Verbose specification of datatypes -----------#
      <element name="foo">
        <choice>
          <data type="integer"
            datatypeLibrary="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"/>
          <data type="float"
            datatypeLibrary="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"/>
        </choice>
      </element>

  A more parsimonious approach is to indicate a datatype library
  at the top level.  If a specific data value needs to follow a
  different datatype library, you can override that within that
  individual '<data>' tag.  E.g.

      #---------- Concise specification of datatypes -----------#
      <element name="foo">
            datatypeLibrary="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"/>
        <choice>
          <data type="integer"/>
          <data type="float"/>
        </choice>
      </element>

  A nice feature that you have already seen is that defining
  compound datatypes uses the exact same patterns as definitions
  of elements and attributes.  A choice is the most generally
  applicable pattern element, but others--including '<list>'
  which is discussed below--are sometimes applicable.

  Enumerations may be specified using the '<value>' element
  instead of a '<data>' element.  For example:

      #----------- Enumerated values using choice --------------#
      <element name="foo">
        <choice>
          <value type="integer">1</value>
          <value type="integer">2</value>
          <value type="integer">3</value>
          <value type="string">infinity</value>
        </choice>
      </element>

  Some datatypes in libraries can allow parameterization.  If
  this option exists, you can narrow the range of acceptable
  values (without limiting all the way to an explicit
  enumeration).  The power is identical to that in a
  library--i.e. to what W3C XML Schema allows.  For example:

      #------- Parametric specification of datatype  -----------#
      <element name="foo">
        <data type="string">
          <param name="maxLength">10</param>
        </data>
      </element>

  When you utilize a datatype library, you can still construct
  somewhat customized datatypes using the '<list>' element.  A
  list is simply a whitespace separated sequence of tokens, each
  matching some datatype.  As elsewhere, lists can describe
  either element or attribute contents.  For example, suppose you
  would like an attribute to contain a collection of one or more
  integer values:

      #------- Compound specification of datatype  -------------#
      <element name="foo">
        <attribute name="numbers">
          <list>
            <oneOrMore>
              <data type="integer"/>
            </oneOrMore>
          </list>
        </attribute>
      </element>

  A matching document is:

      <foo numbers="1 2 3 988765"/>

  An invalid document example is:

      <foo numbers="word"/>

WHAT NEXT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is a bit more to RELAX NG than this article has touched
  on, but surprisingly little.  It is quite remarkable just how
  much power can be had with so few simple concepts.  The next
  installments will touch on some matters like merging grammars,
  infoset augmentation (or lack thereof), fudging cardinality
  constraints, and a few other semantic concepts.  But for the
  most part, we will move on to tools and the compact syntax in
  the next two _XML Matters_ installments.
