    Welcome to "Network Client Management", the fifth of seven tutorials
    covering intermediate network administration on Linux. In this
    tutorial, we examine several protocols centralized configuration of
    network settings on clients within a network. DHCP is widely used to
    establish basic handshaking to clients machines, such as assigning
    IP addresses. At a higher level, NIS and more often LDAP are used
    arbitrary shared information among machines on a network. This
    tutorial also discusses PAM which is a flexible, networked, user
    authentication system.

About this series

  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.

  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:

  * Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  * Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  * Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  * Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  * Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  * Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)

About this tutorial

  Welcome to "Network Client Management", the fifth of seven tutorials
  covering intermediate network administration on Linux. In this
  tutorial, we examine several protocols centralized configuration of
  network settings on clients within a network. DHCP is widely used to
  establish basic handshaking to clients machines, such as assigning IP
  addresses. At a higher level, NIS and more often LDAP are used
  arbitrary shared information among machines on a network. This
  tutorial also discusses PAM which is a flexible, networked, user
  authentication system.

Prerequisites

  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.

About  DHCP

  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a successor to the older
  BOOTP protocol. The principle role of a DHCP server is to assign IP
  addresses to client machines that may connect or disconnect from a
  network. Most IP networks, even those with stable topologies and
  client lists, use DHCP to prevent conflicts in IP address allocation.
  Additionally, a DHCP server provides clients with routing and subnet
  information, DNS addresses, and in some cases other information. DHCP
  assignments may have varying durations, ranging from short to
  infinite, depending on server configuration and client request
  details. In fact, DHCP is consistent with assigning fixed IP addresses
  to specific machines (via their MAC hardware addresses), but in any
  case prevents conflicts among machines.

  The formal specification of DHCP is RFC 2131, and may be found at
  <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt>.

About NIS

  The Network Information Service (NIS) is Sun Microsystems' "Yellow
  Pages" (YP) client-server directory service protocol for distributing
  system configuration data such as user and host names on a computer
  network.

  NIS/YP is used for keeping a central directory of users, hostnames and
  most other useful things in a computer network. For example, in a
  common UNIX environment, the list of users (for authentication) is
  placed in /etc/passwd. Using NIS adds another "global" user list which
  is used for authenticating users on any host.  For the most part, NIS
  has been superceded by the more general and more secure LDAP for
  general use.

  A good starting point for further information on NIS is the "The Linux
  NIS(YP)/NYS/NIS+ HOWTO", found at
  <http://www.linux-nis.org/nis-howto/HOWTO/index.html>

About LDAP

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a client-server
  protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500-based
  directory services.

  An LDAP directory is similar to a database, but tends to contain more
  descriptive, attribute-based information. As such, LDAP provides
  enough flexibility for storing any type of network-shared information.
  The information in a directory is read much more often than it is
  written, and are tuned to give quick-response to high-volume lookup or
  search operations. LDAP has the ability to replicate information
  widely in order to increase availability and reliability, while
  reducing response time. When directory information is replicated, any
  temporary inconsistencies between replicas will become synced over
  time.

  The formal specification of LDAP is RFC 2251, and may be found at
  <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2251.txt>.

About PAM

  'Linux-PAM' (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of
  shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose
  how applications authenticate users.

  A PAM-aware application can switch at runtime between authentication
  mechanism(s). Indeed, you may entirely upgrade the local
  authentication system without recompiling the applications themselves.
  This PAM library is configured locally with a system file,
  '/etc/pam.conf' (or a series of configuration files located in
  '/etc/pam.d/') to authenticate a user request via the locally
  available authentication modules. The modules themselves will usually
  be located in the directory '/lib/security' and take the form of
  dynamically loadable object files

  The Linux-PAM System Administrators' Guide is a good starting point
  for further information:
  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/pam.html#toc1>.

Other resources

  As with most Linux tools, it is always useful to examine the manpages
  for any utilities discussed. Versions and switches might change
  between utility or kernel version, or with different Linux
  distributions. For more in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
  http://www.tldp.org/.  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's _TCP/IP Network
  Administration_, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).

RUNNING DHCP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overall protocol

  As with many network protocols, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  (DHCP) is a client/server interface. A DHCP client is a much simpler
  program, both internally and to configure, than is a DHCP server. The
  job of a DHCP client, essentially, is to broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER
  message on its local physical subnet, then await a response. The
  DHCPDISCOVER message MAY include options that suggest values for the
  network address and lease duration.  Servers that receive a
  DHCPDISCOVER message should respond to the requesting MAC address with
  a DHCPOFFER message.  The client, in turn, responds with a DHCPREQUEST
  message to one of the offering servers, usually to the first (and
  only) responding server.  The actual configuration parameters a client
  uses are received in a DHCPACK message.  At that point, the client has
  received an allocated IP address, and its communications will move, so
  to speak, from the Data Link Layer (e.g. ethernet) to the Network
  Layer (i.e. IP).

The client process

  A DHCP client typically only needs to be configured with the set of
  information it wishes to obtain.  For example, Debian-based
  distributions typically use the DHCP client 'dhclient' which is
  configured with the '/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf' file.  The sample file
  that is distributed with the 'dhcp3-client' package has all but one
  configuration option commented out.  The one enabled option might look
  like:

      #------------------ dhclient.conf option ------------------------#
      request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
        domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name,
        netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;

  In this example, which is the default configuration, the client
  essentially just says "ask for everything possible".  In the
  negotiation messages, the DHCPACK message from the server will contain
  information for all these requested values, which the client will use
  once they are receieved.  Client IP address is implied in this list,
  since that configuration is always negotiated.

  As well as specifying timeout and lease time options (and a few
  others), a client -may-, but need not in most cases, put some
  restrictions on the IP addresses it wishes to use.  To exclude a
  particular one:

      reject 192.33.137.209;

  To specify the explicit address the client wishes to use:

      fixed-address 192.5.5.213;

  A client may reject a lease offer with the DHCPDECLINE message, but
  servers will try to fulfill requests where possible.  A DHCP server
  may also make a fixed assignment of a particular IP address to a
  requesting MAC address, and configuring a per-machine IP address is
  more often done with server configuration than with client
  configuration.

  In order to keep track of acquired leases, 'dhclient' keeps a list of
  leases it has been assigned in the '/var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.leases'
  file (path may vary across distros); this way a non-expired DHCP
  lease is not lost if a system disconnects from the physical network
  and/or reboots.

The server process

  A DHCP server needs to know a bit more about its options, since it
  provides various information to clients in DHCP leases, and also must
  assure that IP addresses are uniquely assigned per-client.  The DHCP
  server usually runs as the daemon 'dhcpd', and takes its configuration
  information from '/etc/dhcpd.conf' (path may vary across distros).  A
  single 'dhcpd' daemon may manage multiple subnets, generally if
  multiple physical networks connect to a server; most frequently,
  however, one server manages one subnet.  Below is a fairly complete
  example of a server configuration:

      #-------------- dhcpd.conf configuration options ----------------#
      # default/max lease in seconds: day/week
      default-lease-time 86400;
      max-lease-time 604800;
      option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
      option broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;
      option routers 192.168.2.1;
      # DNS locally, fallback to outside local domain
      option domain-name-servers 192.168.2.1, 151.203.0.84;
      option domain-name "example.com";
      # Set the subnet in which IP address are pooled
      subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
         range 192.168.2.100 192.168.2.199;
      }
      # Assign a fixed IP to a couple machines by MAC address
      group {
         use-host-decl-names true;
         host first.example.com {
            hardware ethernet 00:00:c1:a2:de:10;
            fixed-address 192.168.2.200;
         }
         host second.example.com {
            hardware ethernet 00:dd:cc:a1:78:34;
            fixed-address 192.168.2.201;
         }

  When a client sends out a broadcast message to a server running with
  this configuration, it will either receive a lease on 192.168.2.200 or
  192.168.2.201 if it has the specified MAC address, or it will receive
  a lease on an available address in the pool 192.168.2.100 through
  192.168.2.199.

  A client may also use the DHCPINFORM message to tell a
  server that it already has an assigned IP address (e.g. manually
  configured), but wishes to obtain other configuration information.
  Notice the informing a server that a client -is- using a particular IP
  address is not the same as a requesting a specific IP address; in the
  latter case, the server may or may not grant the request, depending on
  existing leases.  In the former case, the server has no decision in
  the matter, and no lease is granted per se at all (however, servers
  will try to avoid assigning IP addresses known to be in use to new
  requesting clients).

  When leases expire, clients and servers must negotiate new leases for
  configuration parameters to remain valid. Shorter leases may be used
  where configuration information on a server is likely to change (for
  example, with dynamic DNS via an external WAN). A client may
  gracefully terminate a lease by sending the DHCPRELEASE message, but
  this is not required for correct operation (clients sometimes crash,
  reboot, or become disconnected without the opportunity to send this
  message, after all).  Absent a release message, a lease is maintained
  by the server for whatever time terms it was granted on, so a
  rebooted machine will often continue using its prior lease (which will
  be stored in 'dhclient.leases' on both server and client).

RUNNING NIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to use NIS

  Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as "Sun Yellow
  Pages", but the name was changed due to trademark issues. You will
  notice, however, that most of the utilities associated with NIS are
  still named with a "yp" prefix because of the historical service name.
  NIS is used to let a network of machines share information such as
  users and groups (e.g. the contents of '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/group',
  respectively), hence allowing users rights on any machine within a NIS
  domain.

  NIS operates in a manner similar to DNS in defining domains where
  information is distributed, and also in allowing master and slave
  servers to hierarchically distribute information within a domain. In
  fact, in principle NIS could be used in place of DNS by distributing
  domain name information found in '/etc/hosts'; but this is rarely done
  in practice. But NIS has a certain flexibility in that any type of
  information can, in principle be put into a NIS database (which is in
  DBM format: though the tool 'makedbm' in the NIS server package
  converts flat files to this format; generally "behind the scenes").

  There also exists a service called NIS+ which was intended to
  supercede NIS, and includes data encryption and authentication.
  However, NIS+ is not backwards compatible with NIS, and is not widely
  used.

Before you start

  To run any of the NIS utilities you need to run the daemon
  '/sbin/portmap' which converts RPC program numbers into TCP/IP (or
  UDP/IP) protocol port numbers, since NIS clients make RPC calls.  Most
  Linux distributions launch '/sbin/portmap' in their startup scripts,
  but you should check that this daemon is running with:

      % ps -ax | grep portmap

  If not already running, install '/sbin/portmap' and include it in your
  system startup scripts.

NIS client utilities (ypbind daemon)

  A NIS client includes the tools 'ypbind', 'ypwhich', 'ypcat',
  'yppoll', and 'ypmatch'. The daemon 'ypbind' must run as root, and is
  normally launched as part of system startup scripts (though it is not
  required to do so). The other tools rely on the services of 'ypbind',
  but run at a user level. Old version of 'ypbind' broadcast a binding
  request on the local network, but this allows a malicious NIS server
  to answer the request and provide bad user and group information to
  clients.  It is preferable to configure specific servers for 'ypbind'
  to connect to using the '/etc/yp.conf' file.  If multiple servers are
  configured (or if broadcase is used despite the danger), 'ypbind' may
  switch bound server each 15 minutes, according to which is able to
  respond most quickly.  These various servers should be arranged in
  master/slave configuration, but the client does not need to know or
  care about that detail.  For example, a 'ypbind' configuration may
  look like:

      #------------------------- /etc/yp.conf -------------------------#
      ypserver 192.168.2.1
      ypserver 192.168.2.2
      ypserver 192.168.1.100
      ypserver 192.168.2.200

  Before '/usr/sbin/ypbind' runs, you must set the NIS domainname of
  your network. This may be whatever name the NIS server is configured
  to use, and should generally be chosen as something different from the
  DNS domainname. Set the NIS domainname using (substitute the actual
  name):

      % ypdomainname my.nis.domain

NIS client utilities (other configuration)

  If you want to use NIS as part of your domain name lookup, you should
  modify '/etc/host.conf' to include NIS in the lookup order, e.g. to
  check a name first in '/etc/hosts', then in NIS, then in DNS:

      % cat /etc/host.conf
      order hosts,nis,bind

  To enable NIS distributed users, you should modify the client
  '/etc/passwd' file to include:

      #-------------------- Basic /etc/passwd -------------------------#
      +::::::

  The NIS database information acts as a template for login attempts
  with this "unfilled" pattern.  You may fine tune the user information
  if you like, for example:

      #-------------------- Deatiled /etc/passwd ----------------------#
      +user1:::::::
      +user2:::::::
      +user3:::::::
      +@sysadmins:::::::
      -ftp
      +:*::::::/etc/NoShell

  This allows login-access only to user1, user2 and user3, and all
  members of the sysadmin netgroup, but provides the account data of all
  other users in the NIS database.

  NIS sources themselves are configured in '/etc/nsswitch.conf'.  The
  name might suggest this is strictly for name server lookup, but a
  variety of information types are described.  Basically, this
  configuration describes the order in which information sources are
  serached.  The name 'nis' in an order means information obtained from
  a NIS server; the name 'files' means to use an appropriate local
  configuration file.  The name 'dns' is used for the 'hosts' option.
  As well, you may specify what to do if an initial source does not contain the
  information desired, 'return' means to give up (unless NIS was simply
  altogether unresponsive, 'continue' means to try the next source for
  that datum).  For example:

      #--------------------- /etc/nsswitch.conf -----------------------#
      passwd:         compat
      group:          compat
      shadow:         compat
      hosts:          dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
      networks:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
      ethers:         nis [NOTFOUND=continue] files
      protocols:      nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
      rpc:            nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
      services:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files

NIS client user utilities

  The utilities 'ypwhich', 'ypcat', 'yppoll', and 'ypmatch' are used at
  a user level to query NIS information.  'ypwchich' prints the name of
  a NIS server; 'ypcat' prints the values of all the keys in a NIS
  database; 'yppoll' prints the version and master server of a NIS map;
  'ypmatch' prints the values of one or more keys from a NIS map.  See
  the corresponding 'man' pages of each utility for more usage
  information.

NIS server utilities (ypinit, ypserv)

  A NIS server uses the 'ypserv' daemon to provide NIS databases to
  clients, and is configured with the '/etc/ypserv.conf' file. As
  mentioned, you may run both master and slave NIS servers within a
  domain. The set of NIS databases is initialized on a master server
  using (just the first time you run it; after that use
  'make -C /var/yp'):

      % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

  A slave server is really just a NIS client that gets its databases
  from the master server (and runs 'ypserv').  To copy master server
  information to the locally running slave server, use:

      % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s my.nist.domain

  On the master server, the NIS database are built from information in
  (some of) the following familiar configuration files: '/etc/passwd',
  '/etc/group', '/etc/hosts', '/etc/networks', '/etc/services',
  '/etc/protocols', '/etc/netgroup', '/etc/rpc'. Exactly what databases
  are exported is configured in '/var/yp/Makefile', which also
  propagates changes when it is rebuilt.

  Slave servers will be notified of any change to the NIS maps when they
  are rebuilt, (via the 'yppush program'), and automatically retrieve
  the necessary changes in order to synchronize their databases. NIS
  clients do not need to do this since they continually talk to the NIS
  server to read the information stored in it's DBM databases.

RUNNING LDAP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to use LDAP

  In principle, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is similar in
  purpose to NIS.  Both distribute some structured information about
  network configurations from client to server.  However, LDAP goes
  further in hierarchially structuring which information is distributed
  to which clients, redirecting requests to other LDAP servers where
  necessary, and in building in security mechanisms.  Moreover, LDAP
  provides mechanisms and tools for clients to update information held
  in LDAP servers, which in turn distribute that information to other
  clients requesting it (subject to permissions, of course).

Installation

  Before you run OpenLDAP (the Free Software implementation generally
  used on Linux, though some commercial implementations exist), you will
  need to install or verify the existence of several requisite
  libraries:

  * The OpenSSL Transport Layer Security (TLS) services, which may be
  obtained from <http://www.openssl.org/> (or via the install mechanisms
  of your Linux distribution).

  * Kerberos Authentication Services are optionally supported, but this
  is very desirable.  Either MIT Kerberos from
  <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/> or Heimdal Kerberos from
  <http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/> will work.

  * Simple Authentication and Security Layer.  This may be installed as
  part of your base distro, but may be obtained as Cyrus SASL from
  <http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html>.

  * Sleepycat Software Berkeley DB from
  <http://www.sleepycat.com/download/> is recommended though other DBM
  implementations are probably compatible.

  * Posix threads and TCP wrappers are desirable, if not strictly
  required.

  Given that you have satisfied these prerequisites, download the
  OpenLDAP library from <http://www.openldap.org/software/download/>,
  and perform a more-or-less usual dance:

      % ./configure
      % make depend
      % make
      % make test  # make sure things went OK
      % su root -c 'make install'

  After basic installation, you need to configure the 'slapd'
  configuration, usually at '/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf'.  Setup
  should include your domain components, e.g.:

      #--------------------Include with slapd.conf --------------------#
      database bdb
      suffix "dc=eng,dc=uni,dc=edu,dc=eu"
      rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=eng,dc=uni,dc=edu,dc=eu"
      rootpw <secret>
      directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

  In order to find a value for "<secret>", use the utility 'slappasswd',
  and use this encrypted base64 encoded string for your "<secret>".
  E.g.:

      % slappasswd
      New password: *******
      Re-enter new password: ********
      {SSHA}YzPqL5Jio2+17NFIy/pAz8pqS5Ko13fH


  To find more on all the permission, replication, and other options you
  can configure in 'slapd.conf' take a careful look at its detailed
  'manpage'.

  Launching the 'slapd' daemon is pretty much like staring any daemon;
  you can test it worked with 'ldapsearch':

      su root -c /usr/local/libexec/slapd
      ldapsearch -x -b '' -s base '(objectclass=*)' namingContexts

  If all went well, you should see, e.g.:

      dn:
      namingContexts: dc=eng,dc=uni,dc=edu,dc=eu

Adding data with an LDIF file

  The data format used in LDAP is a binary format, but a ASCII
  serialization called LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) for exporting
  and importing data to an LDAP database. Binary data in LDIF is
  represented as base64 encoding. OpenLDAP includes tools for exporting
  data from LDAP servers to LDIF ('ldapsearch'), importing data from
  LDIF to LDAP servers ('ldapadd'), and applying a set of changes,
  described in LDIF, to LDAP servers ('ldapmodify' and 'ldapdelete').

  Moreover, LDIF is one of the formats for importing and exporting
  address book data that the address books in the Mozilla Application
  Suite and other user application-level tools. Even Microsoft Windows
  2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 include an LDIF tool 'LDIFDE' for
  transferring data to/from Active Directory.

  To manually add information to an LDAP server, first create an LDIF
  file such as:

      #------------------------ example.ldif --------------------------#
      dn: dc=example,dc=com
      objectclass: dcObject
      objectclass: organization
      o: Example Company
      dc: example

      dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
      objectclass: organizationalRole
      cn: Manager

  Then add it using, e.g.:

      % ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f example.ldif

  Obviously, replace the "example.com" domain with one appropriate to
  your site.  As a rule, LDAP domain hierarchies and names match those
  used by familiar DNS names.  You will required to enter the 'rootpw'
  value you specified in 'slapd.conf'

Querying LDAP databases

  There is a tool 'slurpd' (Standalone LDAP Update Replication Daemon)
  that replicates a complete database of information. But for individual
  data values, you will either use a tool like 'ldapsearch', or more
  likely LDAP support will be built into some application you run. The
  'slapcat' tool is also available for dumping an LDAP database into
  LDIF. For example, many Mail User Agents (MUAs) can use LDAP to locate
  address and contact information.

  Within applications, including ones you might program yourself using
  application or scripting languages, LDAP resources may be accessed
  with LDAP URLs.  These have the form:

      ldap://host:port/dn?attributes?scope?filter?extensions

  Most of these fields are optional. The default hostname is localhost;
  the default port is 389. The default root distinguished name is the
  empty string. If you need authentication information, specify it in
  the extensions portion of the URL.

  In addition to LDAP URLs, many LDAP servers and clients also support
  the non-standard but widely used LDAPS URLs. LDAPS URLs use SSL
  connections instead of plaintext connections, and use a default port
  of 636:

      ldaps://host:port/dn?attributes?scope?filter?extensions

CONFIGURING PAM
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to use PAM

  The first thing to keep in mind about Pluggable Authentication Modules
  (PAM) is that it is not an application or protocol itself.  Rather
  this is a collection of libraries that applications may have been
  compiled to utilize.  If an application is PAM-enabled, the security
  policy of that application can be configured by a system administrator
  without modifying or upgrading the application itself.  Many Linux
  tools, especially daemons and servers, are PAM-enabled.

  A quick way to check if a given tool is -probably- PAM-enabled is to
  use 'ldd' to check which libraries it uses.  For example, I might
  wonder whether my 'login' utility is PAM-enabled:

      % ldd /bin/login | grep libpam
      libpam.so.0 => /lib/libpam.so.0 (0xb7fa8000)
      libpam_misc.so.0 => /lib/libpam_misc.so.0 (0xb7fa5000)

  The use of 'libpam.so' and 'libpam_misc.so' by 'login' does not fully
  guarantee that the PAM facilities are actually being used, and used
  correctly, by this tool, but it is a good suggestion.  Likewise,
  perhaps I wonder similarly about my Apache and FTP servers:

      % ldd /usr/sbin/apache2 | grep libpam
      % ldd /bin/login | grep libpam
      libpam.so.0 => /lib/libpam.so.0 (0xb7fa8000)
      libpam_misc.so.0 => /lib/libpam_misc.so.0 (0xb7fa5000)

  So I know my particular Apache installation is not PAM-enabled (though
  versions are available that include this).

  To check more thoroughly if PAM is fully working with a given tool,
  you can create a PAM configuration file for the program.  For example,
  to test 'login', you might create a file '/etc/pam.d/login' (but
  notice that it probably already exists on your system with more
  meaningful setting, so do not delete the existing copy):

      #-------------------- /etc/pam.d/login --------------------------#
      auth      required    pam_permit.so
      auth      required    pam_warn.so

  Now running a properly PAM-enabled 'login' will let anyone login, but
  log the action to the system log.  If syslog shows an entry, PAM is
  enabled for this application.  Readers will notice, of course, that
  this is about the worst configuration you could invent for 'login',
  since it gives -anyone- shell access.  Having noticed that, you will
  feel warned that PAM should be configured with a certain caution.

PAM configuration

  PAM works with two different types of configuration files.  Most
  'libpam.so' libraries are compiled in the "use the better one if
  available, but settle for the worse one" mode.  However, you might
  also have a PAM library compiled as "use the better one, but also
  check the worse one".  Let us explain that.

  The currently preferred way to configure PAM is with files in the
  directory '/etc/pam.d/' that are named the same as the service whose
  security they describe.  An older and less preferred style used a
  single file '/etc/pam.conf' to set security policy for all
  applications.  From a maintainability point of view, the
  per-application configuration files are just easier to work with, and
  may also be symlinked to "duplicate" a security policy from one
  application in another.  Both configuration styles look basically the
  same.  The single '/etc/pam.conf' file contains lines of the form:

      <service>  <module-type>  <control-flag>  <module-path>  <args>

  In per-application configuration files, the first field is omitted
  since it is already the same as the filename.  In the older style, the
  test-only 'login' configuration we saw would look like:

      #---------------------- /etc/pam.conf ---------------------------#
      login     auth      required    pam_permit.so
      login     auth      required    pam_warn.so

  The <module-type> field may have one of four values: 'auth'
  (authetication); 'account' (non-authentication permissions based on
  system of user status); 'session' (perform actions before/after
  service used); 'password' (update user authentication tokens).

  The <control-flag> field is used to "stack" modules, which allows you
  rather subtle control of when a method is required or performed at
  all, and when some other fallback is acceptable.  It's options are
  'required', 'requisite', 'sufficient', 'optional' and 'include' which
  we will discuss in the next panel.

  The <module-path> we have seen in our examples, it names a shared
  library, either in the expected module location if no path is given,
  or at an explicit location if it starts with a "/".  For example, in
  the above, you might have specified '/lib/security/pam_warn.so'.  The
  <args> might be anything, depending on what a particular module needs
  to configure its operation, though a few generic arguments should be
  supported by most PAM modules.  Notice that PAM modules are
  extensible.  If someone writes a new PAM module, you can simply drop
  it into '/lib/security', and all your applications can use it once
  their configuration file is updated to indicate that.

A PAM permission example

  To see how the <control-flag> works, let us develop an example that is
  moderately complex.  First thing we should do is create a special
  'OTHER' service.  If this exists, and no PAM policy is defined for a
  service, OTHER's policy is used.  A safe default might be:

      #-------------------- /etc/pam.d/other --------------------------#
      auth      required    pam_warn.so
      auth      required    pam_deny.so
      @include safe-account
      @include safe-password
      @include safe-session

  In this example, an attempt at authentication is first logged to
  syslog, and is then denied.  The '@include' statements just include
  contents from elsewhere, e.g. '/etc/pam.d/safe-account' and friends,
  where these "safe" definition might contain similar warn-then-deny
  instructions for the other <module-type>'s.

  Now let us configure access for our hypothetical 'classified-db'
  application. Being rather concerned about access, for a user to use
  this application, she needs to provide either a matched retinal print
  or a fingerprint, and also enter a password. The password, however,
  might be stored in either the local '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'
  configurations, or available via one of two outside database servers.
  None of the security modules I use in this example actually exist (to
  my knowledge), except 'pam_unix.so' which is old-fashioned Unix-style
  password access.

      #----------------- /etc/pam.d/classified-db ---------------------#
      auth      optional    pam_unix.so
      auth      optional    pam_database1.so    try_first_pass
      auth      optional    pam_database2.so    use_first_pass
      auth      requisite   pam_somepasswd.so
      auth      sufficient  pam_fingerprint.so  master=file1 7points
      auth      required    pam_retinaprint.so

  The flow through this configuration is modestly complex.  First we try
  password authentication by three "optional" module types.  Since these
  are "optional" failing one does not stop the authentication process,
  nor satisfy it.  The standard unix authentication password is tried
  first (user is prompted to enter a password).  After that, we check
  passwords in a database1, but we first use the generic module argumet
  'try_first_pass' to see if the Unix password is the same one in the
  database; only if it is not do we prompt for an additional password.
  For database2, however, we only try to authenticate using the Unix
  password that the user entered (generic argument 'use_first_pass').

  Having checked against some "optional" password systems, we use a
  hypothetical 'pam_somepasswd.so' that needs to determine whether any
  of the earlier password checks succeeded (perhaps using a semaphore;
  but how that is done is left open for hypothetical modules).  The
  point is that since this check is "requisite", if it fails no further
  authentication is done, and failure is reported.

  The final two authentication checks (if they are reached) are
  "sufficient". That is satisfying one of them returns an overall
  success status to the calling application. So first we try a
  fingerprint check using 'pam_fingerprint.so' (notice some hypothetical
  arguments are passed to the module). Only if this fails--maybe because
  of the absence of a fingerprint scanner as well as for a bad
  fingerprint--is the retinal scan attempted. Likewise, if the retinal
  scan succeeds, that is "sufficient". However, just to demonstrate all
  the flags, we acutally use "required" here, which means that even if
  retinal scanning succeeds, we would continue checking other methods
  (but no more exist in this example, so "sufficient" would do the same
  thing).

  There is also a way of specifying more fine-tuned compound flags for
  the <control-flag>, using bracketed "[value1=action1 ...]" sets, but
  the basic keywords usually suffice.
