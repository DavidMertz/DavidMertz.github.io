BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Attentive readers of Webreview.com will have noticed that I
  have reviewed quite a few text editors in the last six months.
  A certain bias has been evident in my reviews:  I prefer
  multi-platform (because I work on numerous platforms myself);
  and I prefer open-source (purely as a political matter, I am
  not likely to modify the source code personally).  Of course,
  even stronger than those biases is my preference for a text
  editor that is powerful, flexible, and friendly.

  Boxer 99 is an editor that falls on the negative side of the
  above biases.  In fact, even though it is not all that
  expensive, its $59 cost crosses my mental threshold between the
  "insignificant" $20-30 of some shareware editors, and the
  "should I really buy this?" doubts of more expensive products.

  With so much going against it, what can I write about Boxer 99?
  Just this:  Boxer is the editor *I* actually launch when I want
  to get work done as quickly, efficiently, and with as little
  effort as possible (i.e.  when I am not trying something else
  out just to see what it can do).  At least when I am working on
  a Win32 platform; or on OS/2 and running Boxer/2 (similar
  features, but not specifically reviewed here).  Boxer just
  simply works the way I want an editor to, with no surprises or
  bugs, and with an amazingly well-designed interface.


WHAT IS BOXER 99?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Boxer 99 is a Win32 GUI text editor designed both for writing
  programming code and for writing prose (like this article, or
  README's, HOWTO's, etc). Older companion versions of Boxer
  exist for DOS and OS/2. Boxer 99 includes many features that
  programmers expect in a text editor.


AN EDITOR TO LOVE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  What really sets Boxer apart from many editors is how well
  arranged its features are.  Boxer 99 supports many configurable
  key-bindings, but I prefer to stick with the default one.  With
  other editors, a feature might be present, but hidden and/or
  require too many keystrokes.  With Boxer, every feature is in
  the menu I expect, and the CUA-ish keystrokes are logically
  organized and intuitive.  Moreover, configuration of Boxer is
  fiendly and done entirely within dialogs and menus (no arcane
  configuration files)

  Beyond good organization, the interface has the right elements:
  optional filetabs, syntax hightlighting, optional toolbar,
  optional line numbers, visible bookmarks.  The appearance is
  clean, but at the same time presents all the information needed
  for working with complex projects of related files.

  Easy to find are a number of sophisticated features (each
  individually found in other editors I have reviewed, but not in
  combination).  Let's just list a few.  *Templates* are kept in
  a popup window that allows selection of template sets and
  individual items.  Generally this is useful for insertion of
  code constructs or other blocks that tend to get re-used.
  *Spell checker* with dictionaries available for the main
  Western European languages.  *Multiple clipboards* act as an ad
  hoc template area, and are definitely better than just one
  clipboard.  *Bookmarks* have already been mentioned, they are a
  way to quickly jump between areas of interest.

  For working with text, Boxer offers a number of things many
  editors lack.  *Columnar selection* is a must for playing with
  tables and end-line comment blocks.  The set of *block
  operations* in Boxer is particularly rich:  Change case (upper,
  lower, proper, sentence); indent/unindent; sort; do math
  calculations on blocks with numbers; do a block wordcount;
  comment/uncomment; etc.  In addition, a nice feature most
  editors lack is the ability to search across all buffers and in
  disk files (with flexible selection of file patterns).  Sure
  you could use an external program like 'grep', but the
  integration is nice.

  The thing that -really- sells me on Boxer above other editors
  is that Boxer handles indentation and word wrapping *right*.
  Boxer knows when you have started an indented paragraph
  (including hanging or right shifted first line); it lets you
  wrap different paragraphs to their own widths; it handles email
  quoting; and right/left/center/justified paragraph formats.
  Every other editor I have looked at has at least one subtle
  glitch (or big ones) in formatting paragraphs -- they are OK
  for code, but no good for prose.  Boxer does it right!


IT CAN'T BE *THAT* GOOD!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As much as I like Boxer 99, there are still a few things I
  could wish were better.  Some are small, some more fundamental.
  First some small ones:  I have grown to like onscreen
  hightlighting of matching open/close blocks (parens, brackets,
  etc).  Boxer lets you jump to a "mate," but doesn't highlight
  it automatically.  A few editors have a "hypersearch" type
  feature that displays all matches to a given pattern.  FTE does
  this with an onscreen highlight, jEdit with a navigable results
  window -- either way is nice, and would be useful in Boxer.

  Second, some bigger things:  In a bad decision, the quite
  effective macro capability of earlier Boxer versions was
  dropped from Boxer 99.  The documentation claims that templates
  fulfill most of the same requirement; maybe true, but most is
  not all.  Also, although the search/replace engine handles
  regular expressions to a certain degree, it lacks back
  references in either search or replace patterns.  Without this,
  regular expressions are missing one of their best aspects.
  Still another complaint I would have is that the syntax
  highlighting modes are not quite powerful enough.
  Specifically, Python uses triple quotes for multi-line strings,
  but Boxer 99 cannot highlight these (because the plain quote
  already marks single-line strings).  A bit more powerful
  highlighter could handle this better.

  If I had my complete wish list, I would want two more features
  in Boxer 99.  These are not widely supported in other editors,
  so these are not really complaints.  But my ideal would still
  have them.  *Folding* is hugely useful for dealing with long
  and hierarchical text files (programming code, HTML, even prose
  with sections).  *Workspaces/projects* would be a nice addition
  for opening and shutting a collection of related files (and
  maybe preserving window options for an editing session).
