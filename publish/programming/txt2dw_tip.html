    IBM developerWorks is moving towards a custom XML dialect as
    the source format for the articles that appear here.  But
    writing XML is always going to be difficult for people (but
    easy for machines).  One approach to the "human interface"
    problem is the public domain <code>txt2dw</code> utility that author
    David Mertz uses for his own articles.
</blockquote>
<h3>Source Formats And Human Interfaces</h3>
 <p>
  There are lots of good reasons why the organization you work at
  is likely to adapt XML dialects for many of its documentation
  needs.  For all these same reasons, IBM developerWorks--
  starting with the XML Zone--has developed its own XML DTD for
  articles.  Once you have an XML source, either a shared
  standard like DocBook or TEI or an in-house disalect, it is
  easy to transform the source into arbitrary target formats
  (HTML, PDF, other XML, etc).  Moreover, validation against a
  DTD provides a nice check that a document contains all the
  parts it needs to have, with all the right relationships
  between them.  In addition, XML is a much more platform- and
  tool-neutral format than those used by proprietary (or even
  open source) word processors and publishing applications.
</p>
<p>
  The problem with XML, however, is that it is a really crummy
  human interface.  Even though XML is just ASCII bytes, typing
  them in a text editor is a lot of work.  Besides requiring a
  littering of angle brackets and punctuation to interupt the
  flow of a touch typist, it is difficult consistently to make
  sure that every tag gets closed in the right order; and it is
  especially difficult to know a moderately complex DTD well
  enough to remember exactly what elements and attributes are
  allowed at each point in a document.  Worst of all, the cruft
  of XML tags makes visually scanning a document significantly
  harder.
</p>
<h3>Making It Easy For Writers</h3>
 <p>
  At least two approaches ease the pain of editing XML documents
  with a text editor.  One approach is to use a higher level tool
  for the editing.  An XML-aware editor can automate conformance
  with a DTD, and some of them can even hide or highlight the XML
  markup to make visual scanning easier.  Many IBM writers,
  myself included, are particularly fond of XMetal, but many
  excellent programs exist.  All these programs, however, run on
  specific platforms; they each have their own set of quirks
  (different from those of a favorite text editor); and many of
  them will set you back a large number of dollars.
</p>
<p>
  The second approach is the one <code>txt2dw</code> takes.  Let writers
  write using the tools that don't get in their way.  Then let
  computers worry about how the documents need to be formatted.
  Word processors try to take this approach; but the state of
  tools for getting from a word processor to XML is still crude.
  To my own mind, a better idea is to use the "smart ASCII"
  markup format that has informally evolved in email, on the
  Usenet, and in README's and project documentation for open
  source software projects.  One can formalize it just a little
  bit without getting in the way of writers (but simultaneously
  aiding the converter).
</p>
<h3>Using 'txt2dw'</h3>
 <p>
  The use of <code>txt2dw</code> could hardly be any simpler.  Just read
  some "smart ASCII" input from STDIN, and write some valid XML
  to STDOUT.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% txt2dw.py &lt; MyArticle.txt &gt; MyArticle.xml

</pre></div><p>
  At this point, one has an XML formatted document.  Most likely,
  the eventual target will be something different from XML.  In
  my own case--and for many writers--the eventual target format
  is not really all that interesting (that is for editors and
  publishers to worry about, and change as needed).  All that
  really matters if the utility does its job is that the XML
  version is valid according to <code>article.dtd</code>.
</p>
<p>
  However, <em>someone</em> will want to transform the XML to something
  else.  XSLT is a common transformation technique, and one for
  which IBM developerWorks uses the custom stylesheet
  <code>article-html.xsl</code>.  Assuming you want the HTML version
  developerWorks will use, just run something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% xslt article-html.xsl &lt; MyArticle.xml &gt; MyArticle.html

</pre></div><p>
  The exact details will vary with the XSLT engine one uses, but
  the idea will be the same.
</p>
<h3>"smart Ascii" Format</h3>
 <p>
  For the most part, "smart ASCII" is what you have been writing
  for years if you use email and the Usenet.  Most of the details
  are documented at the top of the script.  Asterisks surround
  <strong>bold</strong> or <strong>heavily emphasized</strong> phrases; dashes surround
  <em>italicized</em> or <em>lightly emphasized</em> phrases; underscores
  introduce <cite>Book or Series Titles</cite>.  I have adopted the use of
  single quotes to set apart <code>appnames</code> and <code>filenames</code> (usually
  rendered in a fixed font), and square brackets to indicate
  <em><code>libraries</code></em> and <em><code>modules</code></em>.  Take a look at the ASCII version of
  this Tip in the Resources for how these features started out.
  These conventions are not quite universal, but they will also
  not be unfamiliar to readers.  They are all very quick to type.
</p>
<p>
  Anything that looks like a URL is turned into a link
  automatically.  A fairly simple special format with curly
  braces and the ALT text before a colon is used to insert
  images, such as charts and graphs.  See the author blurb for an
  example with the author's photograph.
</p>
<p>
  At a paragraph level, a few types of paragraphs are allowed,
  and are indicated by indentation level.  Headers are not
  indented; in addition, any header line that consists just of a
  row of dashes is stripped out (this helps prettify the ASCII
  originals).  Regular text paragraphs are indented two spaces.
  Block quotes are indented four spaces.  Code samples are
  indented six spaces (or more).  If a code sample begins with a
  line the consists of a pound sign, some dashes, a title, some
  more dashes, then another pound sign, that line is treated as a
  label for the code sample (in many programming languages, it
  would be a comment line anyway).  If not, no harm is done.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few features of <code>txt2dw</code> that are more rigid than I
  would like.  These were concessions to the fairly rigid format
  of <code>article.dtd</code>.  On the plus side, the rigid constraints were
  exactly the conventions I had adopted anyway, so obeying them
  was not difficult.  Moreover, none of them look odd or unnatural
  (but one still has to remember to use these features, or create
  a template that does so).  A few moderately intelligent changes
  are made when ALLCAPS sections are encountered.  A usable
  template is below (as a code sample):

  Terrence Parr has written a wonderful installment of his

  "Smart ASCII" can also be converted directly to HTML using a
  related utility <code>Txt2Html</code>.  That was discussed in "Charming
  Python:  Converting text to HTML using Txt2Html":
