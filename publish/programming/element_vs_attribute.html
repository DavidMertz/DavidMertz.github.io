    This tip provides some guidance on when use tag attributes
    and when to use subelement contents to represent data.  What
    considerations go into designing a DTD, Schema, or just an ad
    hoc XML format?  When are attributes and contents
    interchangeable, and when are they not?
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  An odd thing about XML is that it provides two almost-but-not-
  quite-equivalent ways of spelling "this is the data."  One way
  of indicating a data value is to put it inside a subelement
  content; another way is to put it in attribute values.
  Inasmuch as there is not usually a clear line between where
  each of the two approaches is appropriate, XML is not entirely
  <em>orthogonal</em> (which is computer-science-speak for "each
  construct does one thing, and no other construct does the same
  thing").
</p>
<p>
  One way of deciding exactly what data goes where is to be
  handed an XML dialect specification--either as a DTD, as a W3C
  XML Schema, or described informally or by example--and to be
  told that you must use that dialect.  If you are not making the
  choices, do not worry about the suggestions in this tip.  But
  many times one needs to <em>design</em> the exact XML dialect to use
  for a process.  In the latter case, think about the issues
  below.
</p>
<p>
  One thing to keep in mind is the difference between XML
  documents that need to be merely well-formed, and those that
  need to be <em>valid</em> relative to some DTD/Schema.  Validity is
  much more rigorous; it allows you to insist on certain data
  being present, and structured in a certain way; but for the
  very same reason, it is much more work to make sure a given
  document production process conforms with validity
  requirements.  There are advantages to both approaches; as
  well, a imposing a DTD adds pros and cons to the
  element/attribute issues.
</p>
<h3>Is Data Order Important?</h3>
 <p>
  If you want to use a DTD, subelements are strictly ordered,
  while attributes are unordered.  In well-formed-only XML
  documents, one is free to play with order; after all, <em>any</em> tag
  can go inside <em>any</em> other tag, at any depth, in this case.
</p>
<p>
  For example, you might have a list of contacts each of whom
  <em>must</em> have a name, age and telephone number.  But there is no
  logical sense in which age <em>precedes</em> telephone number.  The
  attributes are unordered.  In this case, attributes are more
  intuitive.  Compare these documents:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Attribute data for contacts</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE contacts SYSTEM "attrs.dtd" &gt;
&lt;contacts&gt;
  &lt;contact
     name="Jane Doe"
     age="74"
     telephone="555-3412" /&gt;
  &lt;contact name="Chieu Win" telephone="555-8888" age="44" /&gt;
&lt;/contacts&gt;
</pre></div><p>
  -
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Subelement data for contacts</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE contacts SYSTEM "subelem.dtd" &gt;
&lt;contacts&gt;
  &lt;contact&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;age&gt;74&lt;/age&gt;
    &lt;telephone&gt;555-3412&lt;/telephone&gt;
  &lt;/contact&gt;
  &lt;contact&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Chieu Win&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;telephone&gt;555-8888&lt;/telephone&gt;
    &lt;age&gt;44&lt;/age&gt;
  &lt;/contact&gt;
&lt;/contacts&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Imagine the DTD that is implied by each XML format.  For the
  attribute-oriented form, it might be:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Attribute DTD for contacts document</h4><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT contacts (contact*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT contact EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST contact name      CDATA #REQUIRED
                  age       CDATA #REQUIRED
                  telephone CDATA #REQUIRED &gt;

</pre></div><p>
  One might try to create a subelement-oriented DTD to do the
  same thing with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Subelement DTD for contacts document (try #1)</h4><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT contacts  (contact*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT contact   (name,age,telephone)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT name      (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT age       (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT telephone (#PCDATA)&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The obvious problem, is that the above simple example is
  invalid under this DTD (even though it has the data we want).
  The subelements are out of order.
</p>
<p>
  One could create a DTD that made the XML document valid by
  including the definition:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;!ELEMENT contact   (name?,age?,telephone?)+&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  However, this allows far too much--you could have contact
  elements with no name, and ones with several age's, neither of
  which matches our semantic requirements.  To get what we really
  want would require the extremely cumbersome definition:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;!ELEMENT contact  ((name,age,telephone)|
                    (name,telephone,age)|
                    (age,name,telephone)|
                    (age,telephone,name)|
                    (telephone,name,age)|
                    (telephone,age,name))&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  This is ugly, and it gets uglier at a factorial rate with more
  data points.  And being stricter than is semantically necessary
  for data producers is also undesirable (e.g., imposing the first
  subelement DTD).
</p>
<h3>Do Multiple Data Occur At The Same Level?</h3>
 <p>
  If the same type of data occurs many times within an object,
  subelements win, hands down.  For example a "contacts" object
  contains many "contact" objects in the above example.  In this
  case, it is clear that each "contact" should be described
  within a child element of the "contacts" element.
</p>
<p>
  However, in real-life, one is often tempted away from this
  design principle.  Here is how it happens:  First, you find
  that each Flazbar has a flizbam attached to it (and a flizbam
  is described by a datum).  Good enough, it seems obvious to
  save the extra verbosity of a subelement, and create a
  "flizbam" attribute for the "Flazbar" tag.  A while down the
  road--after you have written wonderful production code for
  handling Flazbars--you discover that in some situations, a
  Flazbar can have two flizbams.  Not a problem, with very little
  change to your installed code, you just change the DTD to
  contain:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;!ATTLIST Flazbar flizbam   CDATA #REQUIRED
                  flizbam2  CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  All your old XML documents are still valid, but new ones work
  also.  After a while you discover the <strong>third</strong> flizbam....
</p>
<p>
  It is hard to avoid this pitfall.  Data and objects evolve over
  time, and singular things frequently become dual or multiple.
  Some programmers seem to eschew attributes altogether out of
  this fear; but I think that goes too far.
</p>
<h3>Is Whitespace Preservation Required?</h3>
 <p>
  If whitespace is important, attributes are no good.  After
  normalization, you can still count on every token in an
  attribute being whitespace separated from its neighbors.
  Moreover, you can add veritcal and horizontal whitespace to
  long attribute values to improve readability without any
  problem.  But if you are representing something like source
  code or poetry, where exact spacing matters, stick to element
  contents.
</p>
<h3>Does Readability Count?</h3>
 <p>
  Ideally, XML should be a format computers read, not one humans
  read.  But--fortunately or unfortunately--programmers are
  humans too; and for the forseeable future, we are going to
  spend a lot of time reading, writing, and debugging XML files.
  It is positively painful to read XML that is formatted with
  only machines in mind (no whitespace, or nonsensical
  whitespace).
</p>
<p>
  In my own mind, it is almost always much easier to read and
  write attribute-oriented XML formats than subelement-oriented
  ones.  Look at the examples above.  Neither is horrible to
  read, but the attribute version is still better.  And better
  still to write it, since you do not need to worry about
  capricious subelement ordering.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  I have pointed to some cases where subelements or attributes
  are more desirable.  Unfortunately, sometimes the real
  situation falls into multiple cases (pointing in opposite
  directions).  And a lot of times, data designs change enough to
  invalidate previous motivations.  Nonetheless, keeping the
  principles addressed in mind can lead to clearer and cleaner
  XML document formats.  The main rule, as always, is "use
  (informed) common sense."
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
 <p>
  Everything one really <em>needs</em> to know about XML is in the
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 W3C Recommendation.  Of
  course understanding exactly what this signifies requires some
  subtlety:
