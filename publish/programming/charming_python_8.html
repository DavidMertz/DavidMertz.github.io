    What most programmers probably think of when they talk about
    "Python" is the specific implementation sometimes called
    "CPython" (because it is implemented in C).  However, Python
    as a language specification has been implemented several
    times in parallel with the evolution of Guido van Rossum's
    reference implementation.  This column consists of annotated
    interviews with the creators of two of the non-standard
    Pythons - Stackless and Vyper.  In a subsequent column,
    similar interviews with the authors of JPython and Python.NET
    will be presented.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  To my count, there are four implementations of Python that you
  can download and run today, and one more implementation whose
  creation is underway.  Each one of these implementations has
  some very interesting reasons for existing, and these reasons
  are presented here (and in the followup article) in the words
  of the implementation developers themselves.  Recompiling a
  compiler or interpreter to a different platform is trivially a
  different implementation (there might be minor conditional
  compilations and changes), but the sort of implementation that
  interests me are ones that transcend platform issues per se.
  In fact, the Python implementations we'll look at are mostly
  multi-platform themselves.  The idea of an implementation is
  also different from that of a <em>version</em>.  All the
  implementations I discuss are basically at the same language
  version (1.5.2) in terms of the language features.  Obviously
  CPython 1.6/2.0/3000 will/does have a partially new underlying
  implementation, but the other implementations can equally match
  the features at these language levels.
</p>
<p>
  It is hard to identify a general pattern for what programming
  languages get re-implemented, how often, for what reason, and
  by whom.  Some popular languages in roughly the same niche as
  Python--such as Perl, REBOL, and PHP--have only one
  implementation (compiled to many platforms).  TCL is mostly
  similar to Perl/PHP, but there <em>is</em> a Java-platform version
  called Jacl.  At the other extreme, languages like C, Awk,
  Cobol, REXX, and Java have each been implemented almost
  countless times.  But those re-implementations have tended to
  come out of licensing and marketing concerns rather than out of
  conceptual and abstract issues about implementations.
  Languages of particular academic interest seem to get
  re-implemented a lot (especially functional, logical or
  hyper-pure OOP languages like Smalltalk and Eiffel).  Lisp has
  dozens--if not hundreds--of implementations and descendents.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the Python implementations we will look at, descendents
  of Lisp tend to introduce a lot of novel <em>language</em> features
  along with new implementations.  For the most part, the Python
  implementations implement the <em>same</em> Python language as the
  main CPython version.  And all the current versions are open
  source cooperative efforts, with the innovations having little
  to do with market positioning, or even with the license battles
  that sometimes divide open source projects.  Futhermore, the
  different Python versions are not really <em>forks</em> in a
  traditional way, but more so <em>concepts</em> that find their
  expression as Python implementations.
</p>
<p>
  The two implementations not addressed in detail until the
  followup column are JPython and Python.NET.  JPython is a
  compiler written in Java that compiles Python source code to
  Java bytecodes.  The Python application is ultimately run in a
  JVM (with the user perhaps having no idea it was written in
  Python source code rather than Java, nor needing to care).
  Python.NET is an implementation yet to ship, but that will
  be--at least in structure--similar to JPython.  Python.NET will
  let Python participate it Microsoft's .NET project, which
  basically amounts to a non-Java VM that can run programs
  written in a variety of languages (such as the new C#, Visual
  Basic, C++, and also Python).  Stay tuned for what the
  developers of those implementations have to say.
</p>
<p>
  In this column, we read what the developers of two
  theoretically fascinating implementations have to say.
</p>
<h3>Vyper</h3>
 <p>
  Vyper is an implementation of the Python language written in
  the functional language Ocaml (3.00).  In contrast to other
  Python implementations, Vyper provides a number of (optional)
  language extensions: both more powerful scoping rules and some
  new functional features.  Vyper is not being actively developed
  anymore, but it might be enhanced later (see Resources for
  obtaining Vyper, including its source code).  I asked Vyper's
  creator John Max Skaller about his motives in creating Vyper:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  There were two reasons for building Vyper:
    First, I like Python, especially the simplicity.  But I
    dislike the lack of scoping, and the need to resort to hacks
    to do anything advanced.  So I decided to fix these problems
    by building a much more advanced programming language with
    some of the concepts of functional programming languages
    built in, while retaining compatibility with python.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  The second reason is performance.  I have a major
    Python program, namely interscript, a literate programming
    tool, which not only suffers from the lack of good structure
    in Python (as mentioned above), but also from performance
    problems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  It would be helpful for readers if you could say a
    word or two about what literate programming is, since that
    was a motivation for creating Vyper.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  The idea is that you do not document programs
    (after the fact), but write documents that <em>contain</em> the
    programs.  Invented by Donald Knuth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  Interscript is typesetter and programming
    language independent, and it can be extended <em>in document</em> by
    arbitrary executable code, written in Python.  That is, one
    can <em>generate</em> both code and documentation arbitrarily,
    although a large number of prebuilt constructions are made
    available for "everyday" needs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  But LP will never be accepted as a mainstream
    technology unless it is FAST.  I put a lot of work into
    making it fast, but in the end, Python isn't fast enough to
    do what needs to be done:  processing strings character by
    character in an interpreted language just cannot be made
    fast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  So the idea was to build a python <em>compiler</em>,
    which could at least generate machine binaries that could
    optimise this kind of code.  This is one of the reasons for
    some of the Vyper extensions, to make optimisation possible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  I never did write the compiler:  the idea was to
    write an interpreter, which was used to load all the modules
    of a program at compile time, and then <code>freeze</code> the resulting
    dictionaries into executable binaries.  Vyper today is the
    interpreter, but I had a lot of fun extending the language,
    and then I got a paying job writing a compiler and now have
    no time to continue the work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  A particularly novel feature of Vyper is its
    implementation in Ocaml.  A lot of readers probably assume a
    compiler/interpreter would be implemented in C (to get close
    to the metal); or maybe for a defined machine, a compiler
    could be done in Python itself.  Why use Ocaml?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  Ocaml generates machine code directly.  It
    performs quite well compared with C, faster for some kinds of
    work.  It also comes with a garbage collector.  Ocaml is a
    high level language.  Unlike C, C++, Python or most other
    <strong>so-called</strong> high level languages.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  Ocaml is a mixed functional/imperative language.
    Like Python.  Vyper emphasises the functional aspects of
    Python more strongly than Python does.  It corrects glaring
    design faults, particularly lack of lexical scoping.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  In practice, there is strong theory behind
    functional programming, whereas there is NO theory for
    imperative programming.  This means functional programming
    languages are generally miles better than any imperative
    ones, from the point of view of development, but often lack
    the performance of systems closer to the imperative
    architecture of the underlying hardware.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Interestingly, the next implementation--although coming from a
  different direction, in some ways supercedes Vyper:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Skaller</code></em>:  The other big killer of the project was Stackless
    Python.  It does something the compiler I am currently
    working on does, and which Vyper probably could never do:
    make the implementation of "ultra-lightweight threads"
    possible.  (cooperative multi-tasking driven by an event
    dispatcher).  Vyper is implemented in Ocaml, which uses the
    machine stack:  something that must be avoided, since stack
    switching (for handling many clients at once from a server),
    is extremely expensive.
</blockquote>
<h3>Stackless Python</h3>
 <p>
  At first brush, Stackless Python might seem like a minor fork
  to CPython.  In terms of coding, Stackless makes just a few
  change to the actual Python C code (and redefines "truth").
  The concept that Christian Tismer--the creator of Stackless
  Python--introduces with Stackless is quite profound, however.
  It is the concept of "continuations" (and a way to program them
  in Python).
</p>
<p>
  Trying to explain it in the simplest terms, a continuation is a
  representation, at a particular point in a program, of
  everything the program is capable of doing subsequently.  A
  continuation is a potential that depends on initial conditions.
  Rather than loop in a traditional way, it is possible to invoke
  the same continuation recursively with different initial
  conditions.  One broad claim I have read made is that
  continuations, in a theoretical sense, are more fundamental and
  underlay <strong>every other control structure</strong>.  Don't worry if these
  ideas cause your brain to melt; that is a normal reaction.
</p>
<p>
  Reading Tismer's background article in the Resources is a good
  start for further understanding.  Pursuing his references is a
  good way to continue from there.  But for now, let us talk with
  Tismer at a more general level:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Exactly what is Stackless Python?  Is there
    something a beginner can get her mind around that explains
    what is different about Stackless?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Stackless Python is a Python implementation that
    does not save state on the C stack.  It does have stacks--as
    many as you want--but these are Python stacks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  The C stack cannot be modified in a clean way from
    a language like C, unless you do it in the expected order.
    It imposes a big obligation on you:  You will come back,
    exactly here, exactly in the reverse way as you went off.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  "Normal" programmers do not see this as a
    restriction in the first place.  This is so since they have
    to learn to push their minds onto stacks from the outset.
    There is nothing bad about stacks, and usually their imposed
    execution order is the way to go, but that does not mean that
    we have to wait for one such stack sequence to complete,
    before we can run a different one.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Programmers realize this when they have to do
    non-blocking calls and callbacks.  Suddenly the stack is in
    the way, we must use threads, or explicitly store state in
    objects, or build explicit, switchable stacks, and so on.
    The aim of Stackless is to deliver the programmer from these
    problems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  The goal of Stackless is to be 100% binary
    compatible with CPython.  Is it?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Stackless is 100% binary compatible at the moment.
    That means:  You install Python 1.5.2, you replace
    python15.dll with mine, and everything still works, including
    every extension module.  It is not a goal, it was a demand,
    since I didn't want to take care about all the extensions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Stackless Python has been absolutely fascinating
    to read about for me.  Like most earthbound programmers, I
    have trouble getting my mind wholly around it, but that is
    part of what makes it so interesting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Well, I'm earthbound, too, and you might imagine
    how difficult it was to implement such a thing, without any
    idea what a continuation is and what it should look like in
    Python.  Getting myself into doing something that I wasn't
    able to think was my big challenge.  After it's done, it is
    easy to think, also to redesign.  But of those six months of
    fulltime work, I guess five were spent goggling into my
    screen and banging my head onto the keyboard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Continuations are hard to sell.  Coroutines and
    generators, and especially microthreads are easier.  All of
    the above <em>can</em> be implemented without having explicit
    continuations.  But when you have continuations already, you
    find that the step to these other structures is quite small,
    and continuations are the way to go.  So I'm going to change
    my marketing strategy and not try any longer to sell the
    continuations, but their outcome.  Continuations will still
    be there for those who can see the light.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  There is a joke about American Engineers and French
    Engineers.  The American team brings a prototype to the
    French team.  The French team's response is "Well, It works
    fine in practice; but how will it hold up in theory?"  I
    think the joke is probably meant to poke fun at a "French"
    style, but to my own mind I completely identify with the
    "French" reaction.  Bracketing any specific national
    stereotypes in the joke, it is my identification in it that
    draws me to Stackless.  CPython works in practice, but
    Stackless works in theory!  (In other words, the abstract
    purity of continuations is more interesting to me personally
    than is the context switch speedups of microthreads, for
    example).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  My feeling is a bit similar.  After realizing that
    CPython can be implemented without the C stack involved, I
    was sure that it <strong>must</strong> be implemented this way; everything
    else looks insane to me.  CPython already pays for the
    overhead of frame objects, but it throws all their freedom
    away by tying them to the C stack.  I felt I had to liberate
    Python.  :-)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  I started the project in May 1999.  Sam Rushing
    was playing with a hardware coroutine implementation, and a
    discussion on python-dev began.  Such a stack copying hack
    would never make it into Python, that was clear.  But a
    portable, clean implementation of coroutines would, possibly.
    Unfortunately, this is impossible.  Steve Majewski gave up
    five years ago, after he realized that he could not solve
    this problem without completely rewriting Python.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  That was the challenge.  I had to find out.
    Either it is possible, and I would implement it.  Or it is
    not, and I would prove the impossibility.  Not much later,
    after first thoughts and attempts, Sam told me about call/cc
    and how powerful it was.  At this time, I had no idea in what
    way they could be more powerful than coroutines, but I
    believed him and implemented them.  Six or seven times,
    always a complete rewrite, after I understood more.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Ultimately I wanted to create threads at blinding
    speed, but my primary intent was to find out how far I can
    reach at all.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  On the practical side, just what performance
    improvements is Stackless likely to have?  How great are
    these improvements in the current implementation?  How much
    more is possible with tweaking?  What specific sorts of
    applications are most likely to benefit from Stackless?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  With the current implementation, there is no
    large advantage for Stackless over the traditional calling
    scheme.  Normal Python starts a recursion to a new
    interpreter.  Stackless unwinds up to a dispatcher and starts
    an interpreter from there.  This is nearly the same.  Real
    improvements are there for implementations of coroutines and
    threads.  They need to be simulated by classes, or to be real
    threads in Standard Python, while they can be implemented
    much more directly with Stackless.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Much more improvement of the core doesn't seem
    possible without dramatic changes to the opcode set.  But a
    reimplementation with more built-in support for continuations
    et al. can improve the speed of these quite a lot.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Specific applications which might benefit greatly
    are possibly like Swarm simulations, or multi-user games with
    very many actors, performing tiny tasks.  One example is the
    EVE game which is under development, using Stackless Python.

   <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/faq/faq_08.asp">http://www.eve-online.com/faq/faq_08.asp</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  What do you think about incorporating Stackless
    into the CPython trunk?  Is Stackless just as good as an
    available branch, or does something get better if it becomes
    the core version?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  There are arguments for and against it.  Against:
    As long as I'm sitting on the Stackless implementation, it is
    mine, and I do not need to discuss the hows and whys.  But at
    the same time, I'm struggling (and don't manage) to keep up
    with CVS.  Better to have other people doing this.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  For other Python users, who aren't necessarily
    interested in kinky stuff, there are a few:  They won't
    recognize Stackless at all, just the fact that it happens to
    be faster, and that the maximum recursion level now is an
    option and not a hardware limit.  And there is another
    promise for every user:  There will be pickleable execution
    states.  That means you can save your program while it is
    running, send it to a friend and continue running it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Finally, I'm all for it, provided that all my
    stuff makes it into the core, at the same time.  I do not
    want to see a half-baked solution, as has been proposed
    several times.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Mertz</code></em>:  Any thoughts on future directions for Stackless?
    Anything new and different expected down the pipeline?
    Stackless still suffers from some recursions.  Will they
    vanish?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><code>Tismer</code></em>:  Pickling support will be partially implemented.
    This will be working first for microthreads, since they
    provide the cleanest abstraction at the moment.  They are
    living in a "clean room" where the remaining recursion
    problem doesn't exist.  My final goal is to remove <strong>all</strong>
    interpreter recursion from Python.  Some parts of Stackless
    still have recursions, especially all the predefined <cite>_xxx__</cite>
    methods of objects.  This is very hard to finalize, since we
    need to change quite a few things, add new opcodes, unroll
    certain internal calling sequences and so on.
