<blockquote>    Unicode provides a unified means of representing character
    sets across languages, and makes multi-language and
    multi-national computing much more transparent.  This article
    provides some background on the development of Unicode, and
    some beginning hints on working with Unicode.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">Some Background On Characters</strong></p>
 <p>  Before we see what Unicode is, it makes sense to step back
  slightly to think about just what it means to store
  "characters" in digital files.  Anyone who uses a tool like a
  text editor usually just thinks of what they are doing as
  entering some characters--numbers, letters, punctuation, etc.
  But behind the scene a little bit more is going on.
  "Characters" that are stored on digital media must be stored as
  sequences of ones and zeros, and some encoding and decoding
  must happen to make these ones and zeros into characters we see
  on a screen or type in with a keyboard.
</p>
<p>  Sometime around the 1960s, a few decisions were made about just
  what ones and zeros (bits) would represent characters.  One
  important choice that most modern computer users give no
  thought to was the decision to use 8-bit bytes on nearly all
  computer platforms.  In other words, bytes have 256 possible
  values.  Within these 8-bit bytes, a consensus was reached to
  represent one character in each byte.  So at that point,
  computers needed a particular <em>encoding</em> of characters into
  byte values; there were 256 "slots" available, but just which
  character would go in each slot?  The most popular encoding
  developed was Bob Bemers' American Standard Code for
  Information Interchange (ASCII), which is now specified in
  exciting standards like ISO-14962-1997 and
  ANSI-X3.4-1986(R1997).  But other options, like IBM's mainframe
  EBCDIC linger on, even now.
</p>
<p>  ASCII itself is of somewhat limited extent.  Only the values of
  the lower-order 7-bits of each byte might contain ASCII encoded
  characters.  The top 7-bits worth of positions (128 of them)
  are "reserved" for other uses (back to this).  So, for example,
  a byte that contains "01000001" <em>might</em> be an ASCII encoding of
  the letter "A", but a byte containing "11000001" cannot be an
  ASCII encoding of anything.  Of course, a given byte may or may
  not <em>actually</em> represent a character; if it is part of a text
  file, it probably does, but if it is part of object code, a
  compressed archive, or other binary data, ASCII decoding is
  misleading.  It depends on context.
</p>
<p>  The reserved top 7-bits in common 8-bit bytes have been used
  for a number of things in a character-encoding context.  On
  traditional textual terminals (and printers, etc.) it has been
  common to allow switching between <em>codepages</em> on terminals to
  allow display of a variety of national language characters (and
  special characters like box-drawing borders), depending on the
  needs of a user.  In the world of internet communications,
  something very similar to the codepage system exists with the
  various ISO-8859-* encodings.  What all these systems do is
  assign a set of characters to the 128 slots that ASCII reserves
  for other uses.  These might be accented roman characters (used
  in many Western European languages), they might be non-roman
  character sets like Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, or Arabic (or in
  the future, Thai and Hindi).  By using the right codepage,
  8-bit bytes can be made quite suitable for encoding reasonable
  sized (phonetic) alphabets.
</p>
<p>  Codepages and ISO-8859-* encodings, however, have some definite
  limitations.  For one thing, a terminal can only display one
  codepage at a given time, and a document with an ISO-8859-*
  encoding can only contain one character set.  Documents that
  need to contain text in multiple languages are not possible to
  represent by these encodings.  A second issue is equally
  important:  many ideographic and pictographic character sets
  have far more than 128 or 256 characters in them (the former is
  all we would have in the codepage system, the latter if we used
  the whole byte and discarded the ASCII part).  It is simply not
  possible to encode languages like Chinese, Japanese, and
  Korean in 8-bit bytes.  Systems like ISO-2022-JP-1 and codepage
  943 allow larger character sets to be represented using two or
  more bytes for each character.  But even when using these
  language-specific multi-byte encodings, the problem of mixing
  languages is just as present.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">What Is Unicode?</strong></p>
 <p>  Unicode solves the problems of previous character encoding
  schemes by providing a unique code-number for <em>every</em> character
  needed, worldwide and across languages.  Over time, more
  characters are being added, but the allocation of available
  ranges for future uses has already been planned out, so the
  room exists).  In Unicode encoded documents, no ambiguity
  exists about how a given character should display (for example,
  should byte value <code>0x89</code> appear as e-umlaut, as in codepage 850,
  or as the per-mil mark, as in codepage 1004?).  Furthermore, by
  giving each character its own code, there is no problem or
  ambiguity in creating multi-lingual documents that utilize
  multiple character sets at the same time.  Or rather, these
  documents actually utilize the single (very large) character
  set of Unicode itself.
</p>
<p>  Unicode is managed by the Unicode Consortium (see Resources), a
  non-profit group with corporate, institutional, and individual
  members.  Originally, Unicode was planned as a 16-bit
  specification.  However, this original plan failed to leave
  enough room for national variations on related (but distinct)
  ideographs across East Asian Languages (Chinese, Japanese, and
  Korean), nor for specialized alphabets used in mathematics and
  the scholarship of historical languages.  As a result, the code
  space of Unicode is currently 32-bits (and anticipated to
  remain fairly sparsely populated, given the 4 billion allowed
  characters).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Encodings</strong></p>
 <p>  A full 32-bits of encoding space leaves plenty of room for
  every character we might want to represent, but it has its own
  problems.  If we need to use 4 bytes for every character we
  want to encode, that makes for rather verbose files (or
  strings, or streams).  Furthermore, these verbose files are
  likely to cause a variety of problems for legacy tools.  As a
  solution to this, Unicode is itself often encoded using
  "Unicode Transformation Formats" (appreviated as <code>UTF-*</code>).  The
  encodings <code>UTF-8</code> and <code>UTF-16</code> use rather clever techniques to
  encode characters in a variable number of bytes, but with the
  most common situation being the use of just the number of bits
  indicated in the encoding name.  In addition, the use of
  specific byte value ranges in multi-byte characters is designed
  in such a way as to be friendly to existing tools.  <code>UTF-32</code> is
  also an available encoding, one that simply uses all four bytes
  in a fixed-width encoding.
</p>
<p>  The design of <code>UTF-8</code> is such that <code>US-ASCII</code> characters are
  simply encoded as themselves.  For example, the English letter
  "e" is encoded as the single byte <code>0x65</code> in both ASCII and in
  <code>UTF-8</code>.  However, the non-English "e-umlaut" diacritic, which
  is Unicode character <code>0x00EB</code> is encoded with the two bytes
  <code>0xC3 0xAB</code>.  In contrast, the <code>UTF-16</code> representation of
  every character is always at least 2 bytes (and sometimes 4
  bytes).  <code>UTF-16</code> has the rather straightforward
  representations of the letters "e" and "e-umlaut" as <code>0x65
  0x00</code> and <code>0xEB 0x00</code>, respectively.  So where does the odd
  value for the e-umlaut in <code>UTF-8</code> come from.  Here is the
  trick:  no multi-byte encoded <code>UTF-8</code> character is allowed to
  be in the 7-bit range used by ASCII, to avoid confusion.  So
  the <code>UTF-8</code> scheme uses some bit shifting, and encodes every
  Unicode character using up to 6 bytes.  But the byte values
  allowed in each position are arranged in such a manner as not
  to allow confusion of byte positions (for example, if you read
  a file non-sequentially).
</p>
<p>  Let's look at another example, just to see it layed out.  Here
  is a simple text string encoded in several ways.  The view
  presented in the graphic is what you would see in a hex-mode
  file viewer.  This way, it is easy to see both a likely
  onscreen character representation (on a legacy, non-Unicode
  terminal) and a representation of the underlying hexadecimal
  values each byte contains:
</p>

</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Declarations</strong></p>
 <p>  We have seen how Unicode characters are actually encoded, at
  least briefly, but how do applications know to use a particular
  decoding procedure when Unicode is encountered?  How
  applications are alerted to a Unicode encoding depends upon the
  type of data stream in question.
</p>
<p>  Normal text files do not have any special header information
  attached to them to explicitly specify type.  However, some
  operating systems (like MacOS, OS/2 and BeOS--Windows and Linux
  only in a more limited sense) have mechanisms to attach
  extended attributes to files; increasingly, MIME header
  information is stored in such extended attributes.  If this
  happens to be the case, it is possible to store MIME header
  information such as:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Nonetheless, having MIME headers attached to files is not a
  safe generic assumption.  Fortunately, the actual byte
  sequences in Unicode files provides a tip to applications.  A
  Unicode-aware application, absent contrary indication, is
  supposed to assume that a given file is encoded with <code>UTF-8</code>.
  A non-Unicode-aware application reader the same file will find
  a file that contains a mixture of ASCII characters and high-bit
  characters (for multi-byte <code>UTF-8</code> encodings).  All the
  ASCII-range bytes will have the same values as if they were
  ASCII encoded.  If any multi-byte <code>UTF-8</code> sequences were used,
  those will appear as non-ASCII bytes, and should be treated as
  non-character data by the legacy application.  This may result
  in non-processing of those extended characters, but that is
  pretty much the best we could expect from a legacy application
  (that, by definition, does not know how to deal with the
  extended characters).
</p>
<p>  For <code>UTF-16</code> encoded files, a special convention is followed
  for the first two bytes of the file.  One of the sequences
  <code>0xFF 0xFE</code> or <code>0xFE 0xFF</code> act as small headers to the file.
  The choice of which header specifies the <code>endianness</code> of a
  platform's bytes (most common platforms are little-endian, and
  will use <code>0xFF 0xFE</code>).  It was decided that the collision risk
  of a legacy file beginning with these bytes was small, and
  therefore these could be used as a reliable indicator for
  <code>UTF-16</code> encoding.  Within a <code>UTF-16</code> encoded text file, plain
  ASCII characters will appear every other byte, interspersed
  with <code>0x00</code> (null) bytes.  Of course, extended characters will
  produce non-null bytes, and in some cases double-word (4 byte)
  representations.  But a legacy tool that ignores embedded nulls
  will wind up doing the right thing with <code>UTF-16</code> encoded files,
  even without knowng about Unicode.
</p>
<p>  Many communications protocols--and more recent document
  specifications--allow for explicit encoding specification.  For
  example, a HTTPd application (a web server) can return a header
  such as the following to provide explicit instructions to a
  client:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset:UTF-8;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Similarly, an NNTP, SMTP/POP3 message can carry a similar
  <code>Content-Type:</code> header field that makes explict the encoding to
  follow (most likely as <code>text/plain</code> rather than <code>text/html</code>,
  however; or at least we can hope).
</p>
<p>  HTML and XML documents can contain tags and declarations to
  make Unicode encoding expicit.  An HTML document can provide a
  hint in a <code>META</code> tag, like:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  However, a <code>META</code> tag should properly take lower precedence
  than an HTTP header, in a situation where both are part of the
  communication (but for, e.g., a local HTML file such an HTTP
  header does not exist).
</p>
<p>  In XML, the actual document declaration should indicate the
  Unicode encoding, as in:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Other formats and protocols may provide explicit encoding
  specification by similar means.
