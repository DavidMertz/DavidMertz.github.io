YAML Ain't Markup Language

    YAML is a data serialization format that is both easily
    human-readable and well suited to encoding the data types
    used in dynamic programming languages.  In contrast to XML,
    YAML uses very minimal and clean structural indicators,
    relying largely on indentation of nested elements.  More
    important than than the superior syntax of YAML, however, is
    the far better semantic fit between YAML and "natural" data
    structures for many tasks.

ABOUT YAML
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I suppose the very first question on readers' minds has to be,
  "why the name 'YAML'?" There are a number of tools that have
  cutely adopted acronyms of the form "YA*", to mean "Yet
  Another XXX."  In the arms race of open-source wit, YAML
  eschews its implied acronym, instead settling on the recursive
  "YAML Ain't Markup Language."  There is a certain sense to
  this, however: YAML does what markup languages do, but without
  requiring any, well, -markup-.

  Although actually no less general than XML, YAML is a great
  deal simpler to read, edit, modify and produce than XML.  That
  is, anything you can represent in XML, you can represent
  (almost always more compactly) in YAML; the one case where some
  special pleading is necessary is with namespaces--you could
  "bolt them on" to YAML, but they are not in the current spec.

  A criticism I have frequently raised of XML in this column--and
  one that I am far from alone in emphasizing--is that XML is
  poorly focussed. It is a classic committee-driven behemoth, it
  tries to be a document format, a data format, a message packet
  format, a secure RPC channel (SOAP), an object database;
  moreover, XML piles on APIs for every style of access and
  manipulation: DOM, SAX, XSLT, XPATH, JDOM, and dozens of less
  common interface layers (I have contributed a few of my own in
  the [gnosis.xml.pickle], [gnosis.xml.objectify] and
  [gnosis.xml.validity] packages). The remarkable thing is that XML
  -does- all these things; the disappointing part is that it does
  none of them particularly well.

  YAML aims more narrowly to -cleanly- represent the data
  structures and data types one encounters in dynamic programming
  languages like Perl, Python, Ruby, and to a lesser extent Java.
  Bindings/libraries currently exist for those languages. A number
  of other languages have data models that would "play nice" with
  YAML, but no one has written libraries yet: Lisp/Scheme, Rebol,
  Smalltalk, xBase, AWK, etc. Less dynamic languages would fit less
  well with YAML. In syntax, YAML combines the contextual typing of
  Perl with the indentation structure of Python, with a few
  conventions from MIME standards thrown into the mix. Somewhat as
  Python is sometimes praised as "executable pseudocode", YAML's
  concrete syntax is very close to the way you might informally
  explain a data structure to a class or work group.

SKETCHING AN APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I think the easiest way to see why you would want to use YAML is
  to start looking at some code in different formats. For this
  installment, I imagined creating a little application with a data
  storage and transmission requirement. My particular toy project
  is inspired by the "Brains in Bahrain" chess tournament that is
  being played at the time of this writing between the FISA world
  chess champion and the best ranked computer player--take my data
  details with a grain of salt. Suppose you wanted to create a
  program that tracked the activity of a chess club, you might
  utilize a data structure that would be described by the following
  code. In Perl:

      #----- Perl description of chess club data structure -----#
      $players = {
        'Vladimir Kramnik' => {'status'=>'GM', 'rating'=>'2700'},
        'Deep Fritz' =>  {'status'=>'Computer','rating'=>'2700'},
        'David Mertz' => {'status'=>'Amateur', 'rating'=>'1400'},
      };
      $club = {
        '_players' => $players,
        'matches' => [
          {'Date' => '2002-10-04',
           'White' => $players->{'Deep Fritz'},
           'Black' => $players->{'Vladimir Kramnik'},
           'Result' => 'Draw' },
          {'Date' => '2002-10-06',
           'White' => $players->{'Vladimir Kramnik'},
           'Black' => $players->{'Deep Fritz'},
           'Result' => 'White' }
        ]
      };

  Python is pretty close here:

      #---- Python description of chess club data structure ----#
      ts = yaml.timestamp    # or mx.DateTime or othr date class
      players = {
        'Vladimir Kramnik':  {'status':'GM', 'rating':2700},
        'Deep Fritz':        {'status':'Computer', 'rating':2700},
        'David Mertz':       {'status':'Amateur', 'rating':1400},
        }
      matches = [
        {'Date':      ts('2002-10-04'),
         'White':     players['Deep Fritz'],
         'Black':     players['Vladimir Kramnik'],
         'Result':    'Draw' },
        {'Date':      ts('2002-10-06'),
         'White':     players['Vladimir Kramnik'],
         'Black':     players['Deep Fritz'],
         'Result':    'White' }
        ]
      club = {'_players':players, 'matches':matches}

  Other dynamic programming languages would use similar
  descriptions of the data structure. Basically, it is a top level
  dictionary/mapping/hash that contains both dicts and lists at a
  few recursive levels, and that also allows nested elements to
  refer to each other.

  Presumably an application that managed the chess club would have
  capabilities to do things like record additional matches,
  add/remove players from the club, or update ratings based on
  matches played. Moreover, an application would want not only to
  -record- a data snapshot, but also -share- it with other
  applications (in other languages) that worked with the same data
  model.  One more thing, it would be nice if we could easily
  touch up the data by hand outside of an application--anyone
  who has developed a data-oriented application or maintained an
  organizations records knows how helpful it can be to "poke at
  the guts" of underlying data structures.


CHOOSING THE REPRESENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Readers, of course, will have already picked up on the fact that
  I have rigged the deck. YAML is going to swoop in here as the
  right solution. But I do not think the setup is unfair. The way
  I structured the data is a whole lot like the way data often
  presents itself, at least in broad strokes. I chose to uses maps,
  and lists, references and data types above in precisely the
  places they each seemed most natural; and I chose the
  underlying problem merely as something that was complex enough
  to show the issues while being simple enough to fit in one
  article.

  If you are willing to require a particular programming language
  (and possibly version) for all chess club applications, most
  languages have good serialization capabilities in built-in or
  common libraries. For example, Python has [cPickle],
  [gnosis.xml.pickle] and [pprint]; Perl has [Data::Dumper],
  [Data::Denter] and [Data:DumpXML]; Ruby has [Marshal] and
  [XmlSerialization]; Java has [java.io.Serializable],
  [org.apache.xml.serialize.XMLSerializer] and various others. As
  the names indicate, some of those libraries produce XML; but
  just because it is XML, that hardly means that it is easily
  transferable between languages.

  In addition, there are a few general semantic problems with using
  XML to represent my chess club data. XML has the concept of
  unordered mapping for element attributes, but nested elements are
  strictly ordered. A particular application, of course, if free to
  -ignore- some of the ordering information; but the -information
  model- of XML always asserts a significance to order, often
  spuriously. For example, matches are considered meaningly to fall
  in a particular (date) order, while players are not inherently
  ordered (you could, of course -impose- an order such as rating or
  enroll-date). The problem here is that you need custom
  programming in every application to -remove- implied ordering
  information everywhere it is spurious; but to keep it where it is
  important.

  A generic approach to representing mappings is taken by XML-RPC,
  SOAP, [gnosis.xml.pickle], and the XML serializer libraries in
  various languages. In all cases, the basic principle is simply
  to use (rather verbosely) '<key>' and '<val>' (or similar tags)
  to indicate unordered pairs, and use different container elements
  to indicate ordered items. It adds several layers to remove part
  of the XML information model, for example:

      #--- XML-RPC model of ordered and unordered collections ---#
      >>> import xmlrpclib
      >>> print xmlrpclib.dumps(({'this':'that',
      ...                         'spam':('eggs','toast')},))
      <params>
      <param>
      <value><struct>
      <member>
      <name>this</name>
      <value><string>that</string></value>
      </member>
      <member>
      <name>spam</name>
      <value><array><data>
      <value><string>eggs</string></value>
      <value><string>toast</string></value>
      </data></array></value>
      </member>
      </struct></value>
      </param>
      </params>

  XML-RPC has a few additional artifacts--like the need to wrap
  the whole object in a one-item tuple--but those are minor
  issues.  The awkward fit between the "native" and XML data
  models is equally evident in any of the mentioned XML
  serialization formats.

AN ATTEMPT AT XML
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are at least two families of issues involved in
  representing my chess club data as XML.  The simpler issue is
  exactly what the best XML representation would be, in the
  abstract.  Putting aside the later interface-with-application
  issue, I would propose something like the following as a best
  attempt in XML:

      #------- Optimal XML description of chess club data ------#
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <club>
        <players>
          <player id="kramnik"
                  name="Vladimir Kramnik"
                  rating="2700"
                  status="GM" />
          <player id="fritz"
                  name="Deep Fritz"
                  rating="2700"
                  status="Computer" />
          <player id="mertz"
                  name="David Mertz"
                  rating="1400"
                  status="Amateur" />
        </players>
        <matches>
          <match>
              <Date>2002-10-04</Date>
              <White refid="fritz" />
              <Black refid="kramnik" />
              <Result>Draw</Result>
          </match>
          <match>
              <Date>2002-10-06</Date>
              <White refid="kramnik" />
              <Black refid="fritz" />
              <Result>White</Result>
          </match>
        </matches>
      </club>

  The above XML data representation is fairly clear.  It is not
  all that much more verbose than the native data descriptions
  given in the Perl and Python examples, nor than the YAML
  description below.  It is not all that difficult to modify the
  document with general purpose tools like a text editor--in
  fact, that is exactly how I created the XML to start with.

  Semantically, my proposed XML has all the problems discussed.
  Players appear ordered, even though they are not intended to
  be.  And the player list appears to precede the matches list,
  even though no such conceptual order is meant.  Player
  attributes are unordered, as desired (being XML attributes);
  but since match "attributes" cannot fit as XML attributes, an
  artificial order is again imposed.

  The more important issue arises with actually reading and
  writing my optimal XML format.  None of the common XML APIs
  comes even close to automating this operation.  For example, a
  SAX reader could look for various "player" and "match" events,
  and manually add to relevant nested dictionaries or lists; but
  this approach is fragile, and needs to be reprogrammed for the
  slightest change in data structure during development.  Walking
  a DOM tree has the same issue.  Custom APIs like [JDOM] or
  [REXML] do not help much either.  [gnosis.xml.objectify] does a
  fairly good job of automatically generating a "native" object,
  but this is only any good for reading in the XML, not for
  writing it back out.  Writing, of course, is symmetric with
  reading, with all the corresponding fragilities.

YAML TO THE RESCUE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The YAML format just simply matches the data structures of
  dynamic languages better.  And it looks nicer too.  Let me
  display a YAML representation of the same chess club data:

      #--------- YAML description of chess club data -----------#
      ---
      players:
        Vladimir Kramnik: &kramnik
          rating: 2700
          status: GM
        Deep Fritz: &fritz
          rating: 2700
          status: Computer
        David Mertz: &mertz
          rating: 1400
          status: Amateur

      matches:
        -
          Date: 2002-10-04
          White: *fritz
          Black: *kramnik
          Result: Draw
        -
          Date: 2002-10-06
          White: *kramnik
          Black: *fritz
          Result: White

  There are a number of nice things about this format. See the YAML
  web site for exact specifications, but this brief sample gives
  you a pretty accurate idea of the basic elements. Intuitive means
  of including (multi-)paragraph strings are also in the spec. YAML
  is terse, while still being readable. Moreover, quoting is
  minimal, with data types being inferred from patterns (e.g. if it
  looks like a date, it is treated as a timestamp value unless
  explicitly string quoted).  References can be used to any named
  target.  And importantly, the distinction between ordered and
  associative collections is maintained.  As an added bonus, it
  is awfully easy to edit YAML in a text editor.

  None of the semantic and syntactic benefits listed above are
  really the strongest point for using YAML for my application.
  The best part is actually the uniform interface to the format
  in all the supported languages.  I can read, manipulate, and
  write the above YAML data file as easily as:

      #----------- Python access to YAML data source -----------#
      import yaml
      club = yaml.loadFile('club.yml').next()
      # ...manipulate the 'club' data structure...
      club_yamlstr = yaml.dump(club)
      # ...do something w/ formatted YAML in club_yamlstr...

  I use the '.next()' method above because a YAML text can
  contain multiple streams, each separated by "---".  The data
  structure in 'club' is -exactly- the same as in the one defined
  in the prior pure Python definition, by the way.

  In Perl (or Ruby or Java), the steps are almost the same:

      #----------- Perl access to YAML data source ------------#
      use YAML ();
      my $club = YAML::LoadFile('club.yml');
      my $club_yamlstr = YAML::Dump($club);

  The roundtrip between YAML and native data structures is free.
  Well, very close. I found two minor drawbacks: (1) references
  lose their names (e.g. "*kramnik") and simply become numbered
  (e.g. "*1"); (2) targets are always spelled out on first
  occurrence--aesthetically I prefer to see a player's
  details in the "players" section, but that is not guaranteed by
  an unordered dictionary (the use of "_player" in the Perl/Python
  samples is a hack to force matters).

WHAT IT MEANS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of features of YAML that I have not covered
  here.  The formal specification is good, albeit somewhat
  difficult reading (as most specs).  For example, the existing
  YAML libraries come with adequate--but not great--conversion
  tools from moving between XML and YAML; and there is some
  support for a technique called YPATH, which is the YAML version
  of XPATH.

  What this introduction hopes to do is suggest some situations
  where YAML provides a better object serialization format than
  XML.  To my mind, XML is not always the best choice for data
  representation--not even in many of those cases where it seems
  obvious.
