      Requirements:  Linux/X11 (or other Motif/Lesstif system);
                     Unsupported Win32 port (depends on CygWin and
                     X11 under Windows)


BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In moving more-and-more toward Linux for my daily work, one of
  the chief obstacles I have encountered is finding a text editor
  that does everything I want it to.  There are plenty of text
  editors available, but they all seem either to do too little
  (jed, joe, xedit, kedit, gedit) or to be far too difficult to
  learn and use (emacs, vi); sometimes both.  I reviewed FTE
  previously as one option for a Linux text editor; NEdit,
  however, is the best general Linux text editor I have found (at
  least for my needs and style).  On a minor downside, NEdit
  is not cross-platform beyond X11; and you cannot use it in a
  console.


WHAT IS NEdit?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NEdit is a GUI programmers' text editor for X11 that rolls in
  a surprisingly rich amount of functionality.  You do not
  realize at first just how much NEdit has behind it.  The menus
  seem pretty simple at first; there are no icons or graphics in
  the design.  The look-and-feel of NEdit is a clean, simple
  CUA-style menu'd application, without a lot of visual extras.
  Each file being edited is opened in its own SDI-like window,
  and therefore no filetabs are used, nor arrangement of panes
  within a main window (as with an MDI-style).   NEdit *does*
  use a Motif-based true GUI--as opposed to the xterm/console
  style of some other editors (like FTE, vi or emacs)--which
  gives it more surface polish.  But NEdit does not advertise
  its richness to the casual onlooker.

  Its visual simplicity--at least for me--is a wonderful
  feature. I *do* think filetabs are a nice interface device
  that is missing, but the taskbar of KDE or Gnome manage a
  similar function at the window-manager level (each document
  appears on the taskbar seperately).  NEdit gives me my
  document, a set of easy-to-use menus and shortcuts, a good
  help system, and otherwise gets out of my way.


THE BELLS AND WHISTLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NEdit pretty well fulfills my checklist of whiz-bang editor
  features.  It is probably just quickest to list them.

  - Syntax highlighting.  A very good collection of language
    modes comes built-in; and creating your own is all done in a
    friendly dialog box (no need for editing obscure
    configuration files).  The syntax highlighting even uses
    versatile regular expression patterns (and highlights in
    realtime), rather than simple keywords.

  - Complete macro facility.  You can do a simple keystroke
    recording for simple stuff.  But NEdit also comes with a
    complete built-in scripting language (it is similar to
    Awk/C/Perl/PHP in look).  Basically, you can do *anything*
    with macros.

  - Access to shell commands.  Part of the nice design of *nix is
    its modularity.  NEdit takes advantage of this.  You do not
    need to write your own complex macros when an external
    program will do something complicated for you.  For example,
    one pre-configured shell command is a call to 'ispell' which
    modifies (potentially) the document you are working in.  You
    can also call anything else you want (including scripts in
    your favorite programming language), and modify documents
    almost seamlessly.

  - Regular expression search *and* replace.  Some editors allow
    regex's in search patterns, but not backreferences in
    replacement patterns.  NEdit does both.

  Lots of little things are in NEdit also:

  - Language modes let you change macro menus along with
    coloration and basic wrap/indent behavior.

  - Column selection is available along with stream selection
    (ctrl-mouse or alt-shift-arrows).

  - Correct handling of indented paragraph wrapping (a problem I
    have had in other editors).

  - Highlighting of matching parenthesis to one at cursor (handy
    for parsing nested expressions).

  - Handles case changes on blocks (upper, lower, but not
    proper); change indent of block.


NIGGLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With everything it does right, I almost feel bad pointing out
  the few things I still wish NEdit had.  But a couple things
  still stand out.

  - No real template feature, and no significant built-in
    language-specific enhancements.  There is nothing you could
    not in principle create for yourself with the macro language.
    But a lot of editors offer things like language-mode menus
    for tags/prototypes for a specific language.  "Shipping" with
    a set of such enhancements would be nice.

  - No bookmark feature.  This is handy in large documents for
    tracking several key areas of a document.  Using split
    windows on the same document can accomplish part of this
    purpose, but not really as well.

  - No folding.  This capability might be a little bit exotic,
    but after working with FTE, I *love* the capability of
    hiding away the body of document-sections, functions,
    classes.

  - Another whiz-bang feature I miss from FTE (and from some
    commercial IDE's) is the ability to produce a set of
    navigable links of function/routine declarations (with jumps
    to the bodies).

  Smaller gaps are: no detab/entab; no box drawing; no inherent
  calculator; no multiple clipboards.  Nothing terrible in the
  list, but NEdit still falls a few steps short of perfection.


ABOUT THE AUTHOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is hardly anything David Mertz feels more strongly about
  than text-editors.  It stands to reason after a tally of the
  hours and minutes of his days.  You can find out copious
