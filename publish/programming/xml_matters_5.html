    Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) are a
    standard way in the XML world to transform XML documents into
    other formats. A number of tools are available for XSLT
    processing, and more will be available as the standard
    coalesces. This article uses the DocBook XML document
    developed in previous columns as an example XML source
    document, and walks readers through a transformation of this
    source into an HTML output document. In addition to the
    actual creation of an XSL document, processing tool usage is
    discussed.
</blockquote>
<h3>Article Background</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to the world of XML transformations! I am afraid that
  you are in for a rocky ride: standards are coalescing and
  undergoing revision, tools are immature and often buggy,
  implementations are inconsistent, and choices are just plain
  confusing.  Nonetheless, don't panic.  Your author will lead
  you through at least one path out of the labyrinth.  And things
  will inevitably get better with time, albeit always more slowly
  than we want them to.
</p>
<p>
  The last two issues of "XML Matters" discussed the author's
  personal project for converting his own academic writings to XML,
  and specifically to the DocBook DTD.  Those columns will
  hopefully provide readers a good starting point for writing
  their own DocBook documents.
</p>
<p>
  From the point-of-view of this column, let us just assume that
  we have some nicely structured, well-formed, and valid DocBook
  XML documents lying around.  It is nice to have them in the
  first place, but the next step is to transform them into more
  conventional end-user formats: things like HTML pages, PDF
  files, and printed pages (the things readers actually read).
  This is exactly the problem I faced after converting a portion
  of my archival writing to DocBook, and this article presents my
  own solution.
</p>
<p>
  My main goal--at least for now--is a good transformation to
  HTML.  But I don't want to forclose other output formats in my
  efforts.  A few smaller goals enter also.  I would like to have
  some control over the precise output without doing a lot of
  work, and without having to learn a lot of new languages and
  techniques.  I would also like to use tools that are free (as
  in speech, and as in beer), and tools that are cross-platform.
  Furthermore, a large number of complex dependencies are a
  disadvantage, even if all the needed contributions are
  themselves free and cross-platform.  Basically, my ideal is a
  standalone executable that just runs, runs reliably, and
  converts my DocBook documents to HTML in just the style I want.
  Lofty dreams, but why not?
</p>
<h3>Approaches To Transformations</h3>
 <p>
  At least four approaches are possible for transforming a
  DocBook document--or most any XML document--into end-user
  formats.  Only the last will be discussed in detail in this
  column, but all are worth keeping in mind as you plan a project
  that involves repeated transformations.  Certainly, all of
  these approaches were ones I seriously considered for my own
  little project.
</p>
<p>
  (1) Write custom transformation code.  Ideally, it would be
  nice to start with a programming language that has some
  libraries for basic XML interfaces like SAX and DOM.  But even
  assuming the basic parsing is a black box, custom code can do
  whatever you want with the parsed elements.  Ultimately, this
  is the most flexible and powerful approach; but it is also
  likely to take more work, both up front and in maintenance.
</p>
<p>
  (2) Use Cascading Stylesheets with your DocBook document.  It's
  a thought.  It would be nice to keep the typographic
  specifications completely separate from the structural markup,
  and just simply have the client device (e.g. browser) render
  things nicely.  That might yet happen, but as of right now
  there seems to be only limited support, and only in IE5.5,
  Opera 4 and in some of the latest Mozilla developer releases.
  Things just do not seem to the point where one can count on
  end-users making this work for them.
</p>
<p>
  (3) Use Document Style Semantics and Specification Language
  (DSSSL) to specify transformations into target formats.  On the
  plus side, a number of DSSSL stylesheets already exist for
  DocBook (and for other formats).  DSSSL is basically a whole
  new programming language to learn, and a functional Lisp-like
  language to boot.  In order to utilize DSSL, you need to start
  with the tool Jade or OpenJade; but those are complex enough
  themselves that many people have written wrappers to them (such
  as SGML-tools Lite).  In order to get a working system--albeit
  by reports a very nicely working system--you really need to
  satisfy all sorts of system dependencies, and install all sorts
  of tools and libraries.  On some well-intentioned, although
  perhaps not sufficiently dedicated, attempts, your author did
  not manage to get Jade-related tools smoothly functioning on
  his system.  Obviously, a lot of other folks use these systems
  every day, so a little more work would have surely put things
  in order. (If readers can point me to a quick, simple
  all-in-one DSSSL processor, I would love to try it).
</p>
<p>
  Even more than the setup difficulties, however, DSSSL simply
  feels like it comes out of different traditions--and ways of
  thinking--than do XML techniques.  By contrast, the final
  approach is basically pure XML, and comes out of official
  (working) specifications of the W3C.
</p>
<p>
  (4) Use eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT).
  XSLT is actually, in one sense, a specification for a class of
  XML documents.  That is, an XSLT stylesheet is itself a
  well-formed XML document with some specialized contents that
  let you "templatize" the output format you are looking for
  (we'll see what this means).  There are a large number of tools
  that (at least nominally) support XSLT; my own hunch is that
  this really is the direction technologies are going for XML
  transforms--either because of, or in spite of, its "official"
  status with the W3C.
</p>
<p>
  XSLT is capable of specifying transforms to any target format,
  but the general feeling I have picked up is that most
  developers find it easiest to work with where the target format
  is another XML format, such as XHTML.
</p>
<h3>Picking An Xslt Tool</h3>
 <p>
  The Resources section contains a nice link to descriptions of
  quite a number of XSLT tools.  I tried a number of them, but
  found Sabletron most to my preferences.  It is free software
  (GNU).  It is multiplatform.  It has a standalone executable
  that is simple to run from the command-line.  And most
  important, it appears to <strong>work</strong> correctly, at least for my
  simple test cases (not all those I tried do so).
</p>
<p>
  A number of the other XSLT tools listed by XSLT.com are also
  free software (see Resources).  Most of those, however, are
  Java programs, and also depend on various extra Java libraries.
  A number of the Java tools appear to be positively evaluated by
  users, so these may be good choices for you.  But I liked
  Sabletron both for the greater speed of compiled C, and for the
  simplicity of installing and using it.
</p>
<p>
  Normal Walsh has created a set of <em>complete</em> XSLT stylesheets
  for DocBook.  Unfortunately, Sabletron simply crashes on them,
  and XML Spy fails to match anything in a valid DocBook document
  when using them (these were my main attempts).  This is more
  likely a limitation in the tools than in Walsh's stylesheets;
  you might have better luck with other tools.  Still, the
  problem gives us the opportunity to develop our own (less
  complete) XSLT stylesheets, which is what we really want
  anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Use of Sabletron is quite simple.  The basics are:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>X:\mydocs&gt; x:\sabl\bin\sabcmd mystyle.xsl mydoc.xml mydoc.html

</pre></div><p>
  What this says is: use the rules in <code>mystyle.xsl</code> to transform
  <code>mydoc.xml</code> into <code>mydoc.html</code>.  You can also use pipes and
  redirection if you wish.  Adjust paths and filenames as needed
  for your environment; setting up Sabletron is as easy as
  unpacking its archive (it also provides libraries you can call
  from your programs, but the command-line utility is a good way
  to get started).  On moderate-sized documents, Sabletron is
  fast enough to be used in a CGI context, if desired.
</p>
<h3>Writing Our Xslt Specification</h3>
 <p>
  For the real blood and guts of XSLT, read the W3C's official
  recommendation (see Resources).  For this column, we will aim
  at more informal details of getting it working.
</p>
<p>
  The specific DocBook document we developed in the last columns,
  <code>chap5.xml</code> was a <code>chapter</code>.  Only a fairly small subset of all
  the possible DocBook tags were used in the chapter.  So for
  now, all we really need is a <code>chapter.xsl</code> file that will do
  something useful with every tag actually used in <code>chap5.xml</code>.
  This is a modest start, but one that is quite easy to build on
  because of the open and extensible nature of XSLT.  Let us take
  a look.
</p>
<p>
  Let us start with a skeleton of <code>chapter.xsl</code>--our "how to
  convert a DocBook chapter to HTML--template:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Skeleton XSLT Document (empty.xls)</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  As you can see, <code>chapter.xsl</code> is an well-formed XML file.  As
  you will also notice, many of the tags in an XSLT document are
  named with the namespace pattern <code>&lt;xsl:*&gt;</code>.  In fact, all the
  tags that are <em>instructions</em> look like this.  In transforming
  to XML-like formats (such as HTML), you will see various other
  tags, but those other tags belong to the target format and will
  occur only within an <code>&lt;xsl:*&gt;</code> element.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, you should use exactly the namespace attributes
  (<code>xmlns:xsl</code> and <code>xmlns</code>) that are indicated above.  The output
  line is probably what you want to keep also; you might use the
  <code>xml</code> or <code>text</code> methods though.  The default namespace (all the
  elements that <em>do not</em> have a prefix) will allow use of XHTML
  tags.  Notice that you must close all your XHTML tags, but the
  <code>html</code> output method will strip out some of the close tags
  where HTML does not use them (for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>).
</p>
<p>
  The above XSLT file is perfectly good to use as a processing
  template.  It might not do exactly what you expect though.  One
  might assume that since no output was specified, nothing get
  output.  That turns out not to be exactly correct:  all the
  text nodes are still caught, and using the above stylesheet
  will get you a plain ASCII version of your chapter.  If you
  really <em>do</em> want to output nothing at all here is what you want
  for an XSLT document:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Null-Output XSLT Document (null.xls)</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Our null-outputter moves us in the direction of a useful
  transform.  A real stylesheet is really just a description of a
  set of patterns to try to match, and a templates inside each
  <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> element that provides a template for what to
  output.  As the example shows, "*" can match any pattern; our
  example just does not happen to <em>do</em> anything inside the
  template, but it still manages to match any element that might
  occur in our source XML/DocBook document.
</p>
<h3>Matching By Descent</h3>
 <p>
  The power of XSLT templates lie mainly in their ability to
  pass matching in one element to whatever subelements happen to
  match other templates.  Expanding on our null-outputter, let us
  create a semi-meaningful stylesheet.  The important tag for
  allowing descent into subelements is <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code>.
  Generally, every template will include this tag somewhere in
  its body:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Minimal Chapter XSLT Document (minimal.xls)</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter"&gt;
    ----- Start of Chapter -----
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;
    ##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  When we run an XSLT processor using this stylesheet and a
  DocBook chapter, we get something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>----- Start of Chapter -----
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####

</pre></div><p>
  This output is not all that useful, but it lets us see what the
  stylesheet is doing.  The root element of a chapter is the
  <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> tag.  That matches, and announces the chapter
  starts.  Within the <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> element various children occur,
  each such child is called something other than <code>chapter</code>, and
  so will pass matching to the "*" template.
</p>
<p>
  For developing your own XSLT stylesheet, leaving in some
  obvious flag like the above for unmatched elements will let you
  quickly see what templates you need to develop.  Let us look at
  a version with some real templates:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Valid HTML Outputter XSLT Document</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;

  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter"&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
          &lt;xsl:value-of select="title"/&gt;
        &lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter/title"&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="para"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;
     ##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  This HTML-outputter shows some realistic features of an XSLT
  stylesheet.  Inside the <code>chapter</code> match template, we lay out
  the HTML document we want to produce.  There is little special
  about the XHTML tags inside the template match; any text we put
  there will appear in the output (but we cannot include tags
  that are not in the <code>xsl</code> or default XHTML namespace).  Within
  the HTML <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, we use the <code>&lt;xsl:value-of&gt;</code>
  instruction to insert the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> subelement required inside
  a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> in DocBook.  In the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, we
  pass control on to other templates (presumably quite a few for
  all of DocBook).
</p>
<p>
  The next template after <code>chapter</code> is <code>chapter/title</code>.  This
  means to match a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, but only if it occurs
  directly inside a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>.  If we had wanted we could have
  simply matched <code>title</code> and thereby specified the output format
  of every <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element in the source document.  But we want
  to format chapter titles differently from <code>&lt;sect1&gt;</code> titles,
  <code>&lt;sect2&gt;</code> titles, and so on.  We perform a general match with
  <code>para</code> in the example (but it never actually matches, because
  <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> can only occur inside tags we have not yet matched).
  For good measure, we still match "*" which lets us see that our
  stylesheet is not complete when we examine its output.
</p>
<h3>Repeated Children</h3>
 <p>
  Matching templates by descent is not the only trick XSLT can
  do.  You can also do conditional outputting, sorting, pull out
  source attributes, and looping over children.  For this column,
  let us look at looping:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XSLT template for looping over subelements</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:template match="simplelist"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select="member"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Rather than descend to every subelement in a <code>simplelist</code>, we
  just assume subelements are all <code>&lt;member&gt;</code> elements.  The
  <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> works much like a nested template, and also
  much like a programming-language loop construct.  The contents
  of the <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> element will go to the output for every
  subelement that matches the <code>select</code> attribute.  Within the
  loop, the contents of the current <code>&lt;member&gt;</code> element become the
  active node that descends down to the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>
  tag we find inside the loop.  That is, each thing in the list
  might have further markup inside it, and we pass formatting of
  those elements to their appropriate templates (for text nodes,
  they are just ouput in literal form).
</p>
<h3>Evermore</h3>
 <p>
  This column has not done more than scratch the surface of XSLT.
  But it should have given the reader a sense of working with
  stylesheets and transforms.  The Resources provide many places
  to read further on related matters.  In particular, you might
  benefit from looking through the more complete XML and XSLT
  examples in this article's archive file.  Stay tuned, this
  column is bound to come back to XSLT in numerous ways.
