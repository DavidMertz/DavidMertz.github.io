    A number of parsing tools have been written for Python.  An
    earlier column dealt with the low-level state-machine (and
    therefore, parser) <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>.  This column discusses one
    high level parsing language built on top of Python.
    <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> provides an EBNF-style syntax on top of
    <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> that can greatly clarify the expression of
    grammars.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  Formal parsers are a bit new to me, as perhaps to a number of
  readers.  In this article, I introduce some basic concepts in
  parsing, and discuss a Python tool for peforming parsing.
  Hopefully, both readers and I will benefit from the exercise.
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, like most any programmer, I have frequently needed
  to identify parts and structures that exist inside textual
  documents:  log files, configuration files, delimited data, and
  more free-form (but still semi-structured) report formats.  All
  of these documents have their own "little languages" for what
  can occur within them.  In fact, a number of installments of
  this column have dealt with these very matters.
</p>
<p>
  The way I have programmed these informal parsing tasks has
  always been somewhat of a hodgepodge of custom state-machines,
  regular expressions, and context driven string tests.  The
  pattern in these programs was always, roughly, "read a bit of
  text, figure out if we can make something of it, maybe read a
  bit more text afterwards, keep trying."
</p>
<p>
  Parsers of the formal sort distill descriptions the parts and
  structures in documents into concise, clear, and <strong>declarative</strong>
  rules for how to identify what makes up a document.  The
  declarative aspect is particularly interesting here.  All my
  old ad hoc parsers were imperative in flavor:  read some
  characters, make some decisions, accumulate some variables,
  rinse, repeat.  As this column's installments on functional
  programming have observed, the recipe style of program flow is
  comparatively error-prone and difficult to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Formal parsers almost always use variants on Extended
  Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) to describe the "grammars" of the
  languages they describe.  Those tools we look at here do so, as
  does the popular compiler development tool YACC (and its
  variants).  Basically, an EBNF grammar gives names to the
  <em>parts</em> one might find in a document; additionally, larger
  parts are frequently composed of smaller parts.  The frequency
  and order in which small parts may occur in larger parts is
  specified by operators--mostly the same symbols one sees in
  regular expressions.  In parser-talk, each named part in a
  grammar is called a "production."
</p>
<p>
  Possibly without even knowing it, readers have already seen
  EBNF descriptions at work.  For example, the familiar Python
  Language Reference defines what a floating point number looks
  like in Python as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>EBNF-style description of floating point number</h4><pre>
floatnumber:    pointfloat | exponentfloat
pointfloat:     [intpart] fraction | intpart "."
exponentfloat:  (nonzerodigit digit* | pointfloat) exponent
intpart:        nonzerodigit digit* | "0"
fraction:       "." digit+
exponent:       ("e"|"E") ["+"|"-"] digit+

</pre></div><p>
  Or one might have seen an XML DTD element defined in an EBNF
  style.  For example, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of a developerWorks tutorial
  looks like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>EBNF-style description in a developerWorks DTD</h4><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT body  ((example-column | image-column)?, text-column) &gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Spellings vary slightly, but the general notions of
  quantification, alternation and sequencing exist in in all
  EBNF-style language grammars.
</p>
<h3>Building Tag Tables With <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> is an interesting tool.  To use this module, you
  need the underlying module <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>, which implements a
  "tagging engine" in C. An earlier installment discussed
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>, which is powerful, but rather difficult to use.
  Once <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> is layered on top of <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>, the work
  becomes a lot easier.
</p>
<p>
  What one does to use <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> is really quite simple, and
  removes the need to think about most of the complexity of
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>.  The first thing to do is create an EBNF-style
  grammar that describes the language one wants to handle.  The
  second step is to call <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> to create a <em>tag list</em>
  that describes all the successful productions when the grammar
  is applied to the document.  Finally, one actually <em>does</em>
  something with the tagtable returned by <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em>.
</p>
<p>
  For this article, the "language" we will parse is the set of
  markup codes used by "smart ASCII" to indicate things like
  boldface, module names and book titles.  This is the very same
  language <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> was earlier used to identify, and
  regular expressions and state-machines before that, in earlier
  installments.  The language is far simpler than a full
  programming language would be, but complicated enough to be
  representative.
</p>
<p>
  We probably need to back up for one moment here.  What the heck
  is a "tag list" that <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> gives us?  Basically, this
  is a nested structure that simply gives the character offsets
  where every production was matched in the source text.
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> traverses a source text quickly, but it does not
  <em>do</em> anything to the source text itself (at least not when
  using the <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> grammars).  Let us look at an abridged
  tag list to illustrate:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Tag list produced from [SimpleParse] grammar</h4><pre>
(1,
 [('plain',
   0,
   15,
   [('word', 0, 4, [('alphanums', 0, 4, [])]),
    ('whitespace', 4, 5, []),
    ('word', 5, 10, [('alphanums', 5, 10, [])]),
    ('whitespace', 10, 11, []),
    ('word', 11, 14, [('alphanums', 11, 14, [])]),
    ('whitespace', 14, 15, [])]),
  ('markup',
   15,
   27,
 ...
 289)

</pre></div><p>
  The elipses in the middle contain a bunch more matches.  But
  the part we see says the following.  The root production
  ("para") succeeds and ends at offset 289 (the length of the
  source text).  The child production "plain" matches offsets 0
  through 15.  This "plain" child is itself composed of smaller
  productions.  After the "plain" production, the "markup"
  production matches offsets 15 through 27.  The details are left
  out, but this first "markup" is made of components, and
  additional productions succeed later in the source.
</p>
<h3>An Ebnf-style Grammar For "smart Ascii"</h3>
 <p>
  We have seen a glance at the tag list that <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> +
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> can give us.  But what we really need to look at
  is the grammar that was used to generate this tag list.  The
  grammar is where the real work happens.  EBNF grammars are
  almost self-explanatory to read (although designing one <em>does</em>
  require a bit of thought and testing):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>typographify.def</h4><pre>
para           := (plain / markup)+
plain          := (word / whitespace / punctuation)+
whitespace     := [ \t\r\n]+
alphanums      := [a-zA-Z0-9]+
word           := alphanums, (wordpunct, alphanums)*, contraction?
wordpunct      := [-_]
contraction    := "'", ('am'/'clock'/'d'/'ll'/'m'/'re'/'s'/'t'/'ve')
markup         := emph / strong / module / code / title
emph           := '-', plain, '-'
strong         := '*', plain, '*'
module         := '[', plain, ']'
code           := "'", plain, "'"
title          := '_', plain, '_'
punctuation    := (safepunct / mdash)
mdash          := '--'
safepunct      := [!@#$%^&amp;()+=|\{}:;&lt;&gt;,.?/"]

</pre></div><p>
  This grammar is almost exactly the way you would describe the
  "smart ASCII" language verbally, which is a nice sort of
  clarity.  A paragraph consist of some plain text and some
  marked-up text.  Plain text consists of some collection of
  words, whitespace, and punctuation.  Marked up text might be
  emphasized, or strongly emphasized, or module names, etc.
  Strongly emphasized text is surrounded by asterisks.  And so
  on.  A couple features like just what a "word" really is, or
  just what a contraction can end with, take a bit of thought,
  but the syntax of EBNF doesn't get in the way.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, the same sort of rules can be described even more
  tersely using regular expressions.  This is what the first
  version of the "smart ASCII" markup program did.  But this
  terseness is much harder to write, and harder still to tweak
  later.  The below <em><code>re</code></em> code expresses largely (but not
  precisely) the same set of rules:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python regex's for smart ASCII markup</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># [module] names</FONT>
re_mods =   r<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""([\(\s'/"&gt;]|^)\[(.*?)\]([&lt;\s\.\),:;'"?!/-])"""</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># *strongly emphasize* words</FONT>
re_strong = r<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""([\(\s'/"]|^)\*(.*?)\*([\s\.\),:;'"?!/-])"""</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># -emphasize- words</FONT>
re_emph =   r<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""([\(\s'/"]|^)-(.*?)-([\s\.\),:;'"?!/])"""</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># _Book Title_ citations</FONT>
re_title =  r<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""([\(\s'/"]|^)_(.*?)_([\s\.\),:;'"?!/-])"""</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># 'Function()' names</FONT>
re_funcs =  r<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""([\(\s/"]|^)'(.*?)'([\s\.\),:;"?!/-])"""</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  If you discover or invent some slightly new variant of the
  language, it is <strong>a lot</strong> easier to play with the EBNF grammar
  than with those regular expressions.  Moreover, using
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> will generally even be faster in performing the
  manipulations of the patterns
</p>
<h3>Generating And Using A Taglist</h3>
 <p>
  For our sample program, we put the actual grammar in a separate
  file.  For most purposes, this is a good organization to use.
  Changing the grammar is usually a different sort of task than
  changing the application logic; and the files reflect this.
  But the whole of what we do with the grammar is pass it as a
  string to a <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> function, so in principle we could
  include it in the main application (or even dynamically
  generate it in some way).
</p>
<p>
  Let us look at our entire--compact--tagging application:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>typographify.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> os
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> sys <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> stdin, stdout, stderr
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> simpleparse <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> generator
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> mx.TextTools <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> TextTools

input = stdin.read()
decl = open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'typographify.def'</FONT>).read()
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> typo_html <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> codes
parser = generator.buildParser(decl).parserbyname(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'para'</FONT>)
taglist = TextTools.tag(input, parser)
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> tag, beg, end, parts <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> taglist[1]:
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> tag == <FONT COLOR=#115511>'plain'</FONT>:
        stdout.write(input[beg:end])
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>elif</B></FONT> tag == <FONT COLOR=#115511>'markup'</FONT>:
        markup = parts[0]
        mtag, mbeg, mend = markup[:3]
        start, stop = codes.get(mtag, (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;!-- unknown --&gt;'</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;!-- / --&gt;'</FONT>))
        stdout.write(start + input[mbeg+1:mend-1] + stop)
stderr.write(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'parsed %s chars of %s\n'</FONT> %  (taglist[-1], len(input)))</PRE></div><p>
  Here is what it does.  First read in the grammar, and create an
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> parser from the grammar.  The generated parser is
  similar to the tag-table that is found in the hand-written
  <em><code>mxTypographify</code></em> module discussed in an earlier installment
  (but without the comments in the earlier, of course).  Next we
  apply the tag-table/parser to the input source to create a tag
  list.  Finally, we loop through the tag list, and emit some new
  marked-up text.  The loop could, of course, do anything else
  desired with each production encountered.
</p>
<p>
  For the particular grammar used for smart ASCII, everything in
  the source text is expected to fall into either a "plain"
  production or a "markup" production.  Therefore, it suffices to
  loop across a single level in the tag list (except when we look
  exactly one level lower for the specific markup production,
  such as "title") But a more free-form grammar--such as occurs
  for most programming languages--could easily recursively
  descend into the tag list, and look for production names at
  every level.  For example, if the grammar were to allow nested
  markup codes, this recursive style would probably be used.
  Readers might enjoy the exercise of figuring out how to adjust
  the grammar (hint:  remember that productions are allowed to be
  mutually recursive).
</p>
<p>
  The particular markup codes that go to the output live in yet
  another file, for organizational not essential reasons.  A
  little trick of using a dictionary as a <code>switch</code> statment is
  used here (although the <code>otherwise</code> case remains too narrow in
  the example).  The idea is just that we might in the future
  want to create multiple "output format" files for, say, HTML,
  DocBook, LaTeX, or others.  The particular markup file used for
  the example just looks like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>typo_html.py</h4><PRE>codes = \
{ <FONT COLOR=#115511>'emph'</FONT>    : (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;em&gt;'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;/em&gt;'</FONT>),
  <FONT COLOR=#115511>'strong'</FONT>  : (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;strong&gt;'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;/strong&gt;'</FONT>),
  <FONT COLOR=#115511>'module'</FONT>  : (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;'</FONT>),
  <FONT COLOR=#115511>'code'</FONT>    : (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;code&gt;'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;/code&gt;'</FONT>),
  <FONT COLOR=#115511>'title'</FONT>   : (<FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;cite&gt;'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'&lt;/cite&gt;'</FONT>),
}</PRE></div><p>
  Extending this to other output formats is straightforward.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> provides a concise and very readable EBNF-style
  wrapper to the underlying power and speed of the cryptic
  <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> C module.  Moreover, EBNF grammars are already
  familiar to many programmers, even if only in passing.  I
  cannot <em>prove</em> anything about what is easier to
  understand--intuitions differ--but I can comment quantitatively
  on source length.  The <em><code>mxTypographify</code></em> module that was
  manually developed earlier is the following size:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>wc mxTypographify.py</h4><PRE>199     776    7041 mxTypographify.py</PRE></div><p>
  Of these 199 lines, a fair number are comments.  And 18 of
  those lines are an included regular expression version of the
  markup function that is included for timing comparisons.  But
  what the program does is essentially identical to what
  <code>typographify.py</code>--listed above--does.  In contrast, our
  <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> program, including its support files comes to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>wc typo*.def typo*.py</h4><PRE>19      79     645 typographify.def
20      79     721 typographify.py
 6      25     205 typo_html.py
45     183    1571 total</PRE></div><p>
  In other words, about one fourth as many lines.  This version
  has fewer comments, but that is mostly because the EBNF grammar
  is fairly self-documenting.  I would not want to emphasize LOC
  too strongly--obviously, one can play games with minimizing or
  maximizing code length.  But in a general way, one of the few
  real empirical results of work studies on programmers is that
  kLOC/programmer-month is fairly close to constant across
  languages and libraries.  Of course, the regular expression
  version is, in turn, one third as long as the <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em>
  version--but I think the density of its expression makes it
  fragile to maintain and harder to write.  And we saw in the
  previous installment that <em><code>mxTextTools</code></em> is considerably faster
  at runtime.  I think, on balance, <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em> wins of the
  approaches considered.
