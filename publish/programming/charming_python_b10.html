    The stochastic behavior of real-world systems is often
    difficult to understand or predict.  Sometimes it is possible
    rigorously to demonstrate statistical properties of
    systems--e.g. average, worst-case, and best-case performance
    features.  But at other times situations like resource
    contentions, deadlocks, race conditions, and other pitfalls
    of concrete designs only become evident when you actually run
    (or simulate) a system.  <em><code>SimPy</code></em> is a Python package that
    allows you very easily to create models of discrete event
    systems.
</blockquote>
<h3>Arriving At <em><code>SimPy</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  I learned of the <em><code>SimPy</code></em> package when I was contacted by one of
  its creators, Klaus Mueller.  Dr. Mueller had read the
  <cite>Charming Python</cite> installments that presented techniques for
  using Python 2.2+ generators to implement semi-coroutines and
  "weightless" threads.  In particular--and much to my
  gratification--he found that these techniques were useful for
  implementing Simula-67 style simulations in Python.
</p>
<p>
  It turned out that Tony Vignaux and Chang Chui had previously
  created another Python library that was conceptually closer to
  Simscript, and that used standard threading rather than my
  semi-coroutine technique.  Working together, the group
  determined that the generator-based style was much more
  efficient, and recently launched a GPL'd project on
  SourceForge, called <em><code>SimPy</code></em>, currently at beta status.
  Professor Vignaux hopes to use the unified <em><code>SimPy</code></em> package in
  his future university teaching; I believe the library is also
  quite applicable to a variety of applied problems.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to my recent correspondence and investigation, I
  confessedly had no background in simulation as a programming
  field.  I suspect most readers of this installment share my
  limitation.  Although there is some novelty involved in the way
  one thinks about this style of programming, simulations are
  useful for understanding the behavior of resource limited
  real-life systems.  Whether you are interested in limited
  bandwidth networks, automobile traffic behavior, market and
  commercial optimization, biological/evolutionary interactions,
  or other "stochastic" systems, <em><code>SimPy</code></em> provides a simple Python
  tool for such modelling.
</p>
<p>
  This column installment uses a fairly simple example of a
  grocery store checkout area with multiple aisles.  Using the
  presented simulation, we can ask questions about the economic
  and wait-time implications of various modifications to scanner
  technologies, shopper habits, staffing needs, and so on.  The
  nice thing about this modelling is that it lets you make policy
  decisions in advance while having a clear idea of the
  implications of changes made.  Obviously, most readers will not
  run a grocery store specifically, but the techniques are
  general for a large variety of systems.
</p>
<h3>Simulation Concepts</h3>
 <p>
  There are just three abstract/parent classes provided
  by the <em><code>SimPy</code></em> library, and these correspond to the three basic
  concepts of a simulation.  A number of other general functions
  and constants are used to control the run of a simulation, but
  the important concepts are tied with the classes.
</p>
<p>
  The central concept in a simulation is a <em>process</em>.  A process
  is simply an object that does something, then sometimes waits
  for a while before it is ready to do a next thing.  In <em><code>SimPy</code></em>
  you can also "passivate" a process, which means that it will
  not do anything further unless called upon to do so by another
  process.  It is often useful to think of a process as trying to
  complete a goal.  Often a process is programmed as a loop in
  which multiple actions are performed.  Betweeen each action,
  you insert a Python "yield" statement, which lets the
  simulation scheduler carry out the actions of each waiting
  process before returning control.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the actions that processes perform depend on using
  <em>resources</em>.  A resource is simply anything that is limited in
  availability.  In a biological model, a resource might be a
  food supply; in a network model, a resource could be a router
  or a finite-bandwidth channel; in our market simulation, a
  resource is a checkout aisle.  The only thing a resource does
  is restrict its usage to one particular process at any given
  time.  Under the <em><code>SimPy</code></em> programming model, a process alone
  determines how long it wants to retain a resource, the resource
  itself is just passive.  In a real-life system, the <em><code>SimPy</code></em>
  model may or may not fit the conceptual scheme--it is easy to
  think of resources that inherently limit their utilization
  (e.g. a server computer that severs a connection if it does not
  get a satisfactory response in a required timeframe).  But as a
  programming matter, it does not matter greatly whether a
  process or a resource is the "active" party (just make sure you
  understand your intention).
</p>
<p>
  The final <em><code>SimPy</code></em> class is a <em>monitor</em>.  A monitor is not
  really essential, but merely a convenience.  All a monitor does
  is record events reported to it, and save statistics about
  those events (averages, counts, variances, etc).  The provided
  <code>Monitor</code> class is a useful tool for logging simulation
  measures, but you could record events by any other technique
  you wished also.  In fact, my example subclasses <code>Monitor</code> to
  provide some (slight) enhanced capabilities.
</p>
<h3>Programming A Simulation</h3>
 <p>
  Most of the time in my articles, I present sample applications
  all at once, but in this case I think it is more useful to walk
  the reader through each step of the grocery store application
  instead.  You can clip together each portion if you wish; the
  <em><code>SimPy</code></em> authors will include my example in future releases.
</p>
<p>
  The first step in a <em><code>SimPy</code></em> simulation is a few general import
  statements:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Importing the SimPy library</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
from __future__ import generators
from SimPy import Simulation
from SimPy.Simulation import hold, request, release, now
from SimPy.Monitor import Monitor
import random
from math import sqrt

</pre></div><p>
  Some of the examples accompanying <em><code>SimPy</code></em> use an "import *"
  style, but I prefer to be more explicit about the namespaces I
  populate.  For Python 2.2--which is the minimum version needed
  for <em><code>SimPy</code></em>--you will need to import the generators feature as
  indicated.  After Python 2.3, this will not be necessary.
</p>
<p>
  For my application, I define a few runtime constants that
  describe the scenarios I am interested in during a particular
  simulation run.  As I change the scenario, I must edit these
  constants within the main script.  If this were a more
  fleshed-out application, I might configure these parameters
  with command-line options, environment variables, or a
  configuration file.  But for now, this style is adequate:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Configuring the simulation parameters</h4><pre>
AISLES = 5         # Number of open aisles
ITEMTIME = 0.1     # Time to ring up one item
AVGITEMS = 20      # Average number of items purchased
CLOSING = 60*12    # Minutes from store open to store close
AVGCUST = 1500     # Average number of daily customers
RUNS = 10          # Number of times to run the simulation

</pre></div><p>
  The main thing our simulation needs to do is define one or more
  processes.  For the grocery store simulation, the process we
  are interested in is a customer who checks out at an aisle.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Defining what a customer does</h4><pre>
class Customer(Simulation.Process):
    def __init__(self):
        Simulation.Process.__init__(self)
        # Randomly pick how many items this customer is buying
        self.items = 1 + int(random.expovariate(1.0/AVGITEMS))
    def checkout(self):
        start = now()           # Customer decides to check out
        yield request, self, checkout_aisle
        at_checkout = now()     # Customer gets to front of line
        waittime.tally(at_checkout-start)
        yield hold, self, self.items*ITEMTIME
        leaving = now()         # Customer completes purchase
        checkouttime.tally(leaving-at_checkout)
        yield release, self, checkout_aisle

</pre></div><p>
  Each customer has decided to purchase a certain number of items
  (our simulation does not cover the selection of items from the
  grocery aisles, a customer simply arrives at checkout with his
  cart).  I am not confident that exponential-variate
  distribution is genuinely an accurate model here--at the low
  end it feels right, but I feel like there should be a fuzzy
  top limit on how many items a real-life shopper ever buys.  In
  any case, you can see how easy it would be to adjust our
  simulation should better model information become available.
</p>
<p>
  The actions a customer takes are the thing to focus on.  The
  "execution method" of a customer is <code>.checkout()</code>.  This
  process method is often named <code>.run()</code> or <code>.execute()</code>, but in
  my example, <code>.checkout()</code> seemed most descriptive.  You can use
  whatever name you wish.  The only real <em>actions</em> taken by a
  <code>Customer</code> object are checking the simulated time at a couple
  points, and logging some durations to the <code>waittime</code> and
  <code>checkouttime</code> monitors.  But in between the actions, are the
  crucial <code>yield</code> statements.  In the first case, the customer
  requests a resource (a checkout aisle).  The customer cannot do
  anything else until she gets the needed resource.  Once she gets
  to the checkout aisle, the customer actually checks out--which
  takes an amount of time proportionate to the number of items
  she purchases.  Finally, once she is through the checkout, the
  customer releases the resource so that other customers can use
  it.
</p>
<p>
  The above code defines what a customer Class does, but we need
  to create some actual customer objects before we run a
  simulation.  We <em>could</em> generate a customer object for each
  customer who will shop during the day, and assign each one an
  appropriate checkout time.  But a more parsimonious approach is
  to let a factory object generate the needed customer objects
  "as each customer enters the store."  The simulation is not
  really interested simultaneously in all the customers that will
  shop during a day, but only in the ones who contend for
  checkout aisles at the same time.  Notice that the
  <code>Customer_Factory</code> class is itself part of the simulation--it
  is a process.  Despite possible associations with manufactured
  robot workers, a la Fritz Lang's <cite>Metropolis</cite>, you should just
  think of the customer factory as a programming convenience; it
  does not correspond directly to anything in the modelled
  domain.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Generating the customer stream</h4><pre>
class Customer_Factory(Simulation.Process):
    def run(self):
        while 1:
            c = Customer()
            Simulation.activate(c, c.checkout())
            arrival = random.expovariate(float(AVGCUST)/CLOSING)
            yield hold, self, arrival

</pre></div><p>
  As I mentioned earlier, I want to collect some statistics that
  the current <em><code>SimPy</code></em> <code>Monitor</code> class does not address.  Namely,
  I am not just interested in the average checkout time, but also
  the worst case in a given scenario.  So I created an enhanced
  monitor that collects minimum and maximum tallied values.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Watching the simulation with a monitor</h4><pre>
class Monitor2(Monitor):
    def __init__(self):
        Monitor.__init__(self)
        self.min, self.max = (int(2**31-1),0)
    def tally(self, x):
        Monitor.tally(self, x)
        self.min = min(self.min, x)
        self.max = max(self.max, x)

</pre></div><p>
  The final step in our simulation is to actually <em>run</em> it.  In
  most of the standard examples, a simulation is run just once.
  But for my grocery store, I decided to loop through several
  simulations, each one corresponding to a day of business.  This
  turns out to be a good idea, since some statistics differ
  fairly significantly from day to day (as different random
  values are used for customer arrivals and item counts).
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Running the simulation day-by-day</h4><pre>
for run in range(RUNS):
    waittime = Monitor2()
    checkouttime = Monitor2()
    checkout_aisle = Simulation.Resource(AISLES)
    Simulation.initialize()
    cf = Customer_Factory()
    Simulation.activate(cf, cf.run(), 0.0)
    Simulation.simulate(until=CLOSING)

    #print "Customers:", checkouttime.count()
    print "Waiting time average: %.1f" % waittime.mean(), \
          "(std dev %.1f, maximum %.1f)" % (sqrt(waittime.var()),waittime.max)
    #print "Checkout time average: %1f" % checkouttime.mean(), \
    #      "(standard deviation %.1f)" % sqrt(checkouttime.var())
print 'AISLES:', AISLES, '  ITEM TIME:', ITEMTIME


</pre></div><h3>Some Outcomes (and What They Mean)</h3>
 <p>
  When I first thought of my grocery store model, I thought a
  simulation would answer a few direct questions.  For example, I
  imagined that an owner might have a choice between buying
  improved scanners (reducing <code>ITEMTIME</code>) or hiring more clerks
  (increasing <code>AISLES</code>).  I thought I would just run the
  simulation under each scenario--assuming given labor and
  technology costs--and determine which was cheaper.
</p>
<p>
  Once I played with the simulation, I realized something that is
  probably more interesting than I had anticipated.  Looking at
  all my collected data, I noticed that I did not know <em>what</em> it
  was I was trying to optimize.  For example, is it more
  important to reduce <em>average</em> checkout time, or to reduce the
  <em>worst case</em> time?  Which makes for better overall customer
  satisfaction?  Moreover, how do I compare the time a customer
  spends waiting to arrive at a checkout aisle with the time
  spent ringing up the items?  In my personal experience, I get
  impatient waiting in the line, but I feel less worried once
  my items are being rung up (even if it takes a while).
</p>
<p>
  I do not know the answers to these types of considerations--I
  do not actually own or run a grocery store, I just invented the
  problem.  But having a simulation would let me determine
  exactly what the tradeoffs were; and it is simple enough to
  tweak behaviors (including those not yet explicitly
  parameterized--e.g. do customers <em>really</em> arrive consistently
  throughout the day).
</p>
<p>
  Let me show just one closing example that proves the value of
  the model.  I wrote above that the behavior of complex systems
  is hard to conceptualize.  Here is something I consider a proof
  of that fact.  What do you think happens when available aisles
  are reduced from six to five (with other parameters constant).
  I would initially expect <em>slightly</em> worst checkout times.  The
  reality is different:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Two sample runs with varying aisles</h4><pre>
% python Market.py
Waiting time average: 0.5 (std dev 0.9, maximum 4.5)
Waiting time average: 0.3 (std dev 0.6, maximum 3.7)
Waiting time average: 0.4 (std dev 0.8, maximum 5.6)
Waiting time average: 0.4 (std dev 0.8, maximum 5.2)
Waiting time average: 0.4 (std dev 0.8, maximum 5.8)
Waiting time average: 0.3 (std dev 0.6, maximum 5.2)
Waiting time average: 0.5 (std dev 1.1, maximum 5.2)
Waiting time average: 0.5 (std dev 1.0, maximum 5.4)
AISLES: 6   ITEM TIME: 0.1

% python Market.py
Waiting time average: 2.1 (std dev 2.3, maximum 9.5)
Waiting time average: 1.8 (std dev 2.3, maximum 10.9)
Waiting time average: 1.3 (std dev 1.7, maximum 7.3)
Waiting time average: 1.7 (std dev 2.1, maximum 9.5)
Waiting time average: 4.2 (std dev 5.6, maximum 21.3)
Waiting time average: 1.6 (std dev 2.6, maximum 12.0)
Waiting time average: 1.3 (std dev 1.6, maximum 7.5)
Waiting time average: 1.5 (std dev 2.1, maximum 11.2)
AISLES: 5   ITEM TIME: 0.1

</pre></div><p>
  Rather than being 1/5 worse or something like that, eliminating
  one checkout aisle causes average waiting time to increase by
  around 4 times.  Moreover, the unluckiest customer (during
  these particular runs) goes from a 6 minute wait to a 21 minute
  wait.  If I were the manager, I think knowing this threshhold
  condition would be extremely important to customer
  satisfaction.  Who would have known?
