<h3>What Is Xml?</h3>
 <p>
  XML is a simplified dialect of the Standard Generalized Markup
  Language (SGML).  Many readers will be most familiar with SGML
  via one particular document type, HTML.  XML documents are
  similar to HTML in being composed of text interspersed with and
  structured by markup tags in angle-brackets.  But XML
  encompasses many systems of tags that allow XML documents to be
  used for many purposes:  magazine articles and user
  documentation, files of structured data (like CSV or EDI
  files), messages for interprocess communication between
  programs, architectural diagrams (like CAD formats), and many
  other purposes.  A set of tags can be created to capture any
  sort of structured information one might want to represent,
  which is why XML is growing in popularity as a common standard
  for representing diverse information.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  This column arises out of a very practical personal concern of
  its author.  Electronic document formats are a mess.  Over the
  years, your author has written a fairly large number of
  academic papers (mostly in Humanities topics), and I now wish
  to make all these papers available on my web-site (or even just
  be able to read them myself).  Unfortunately, over the years
  my wordprocessors and platforms have changed numerous times,
  and I have many documents on disk that were composed using
  programs that I no longer own, could probably not obtain if I
  wanted to, and are unlikely to run on current computers.  In
  the best of cases, I have been able to locate conversion
  programs that perform a moderately adequate job of converting
  to a program I can currently run; and failing that, in some
  other cases the original wordprocessor format is mostly ASCII,
  with only a moderate amount typographic fluff interspersed.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, my electronic archives are a mess.  Many
  individuals and organizations are in even worse shape.  For
  corporations and agencies especially, truly massive numbers of
  important archival documents are being lost to changes in
  technologies.  And these losses only get worse with time.
</p>
<p>
  On the plus side, the means are available to create documents
  that will age much better than those I have accumulated.  There
  are (at least) two keys to creating electronic textual
  documents that are resistent to changes in technology.
  XML/SGML generally, and DocBook specifically, provide both
  keys.  The first (and more important, ultimately) key to
  time-resistent documents is open standards for document
  formats.  There are two elements to these open standards:
  syntax and semantics (or, "what must a document look like?" and
  "what does a document mean?").  The syntax of a DocBook
  document is wholly contained in the simple rules of XML markup,
  and in the DocBook DTD that is inherent to every DocBook
  document.  The semantics are slightly less distinct.  Certain
  semantic features are contained in a DTD (what elements are the
  type of thing that can/must occur inside other elements?).  And
  the DocBook tags are chosen in such a way as to have a certain
  "common-sense" semantic content, at least to English speakers.
  But some more detailed semantic issues must rely on background
  documentation like that in the Resources section, and on
  traditions of use and editorial judgements (e.g. what type of
  list is appropriate here?).
</p>
<p>
  The second key is of less theoretic importance, but still of
  considerable practical significance.  How easy is a document
  format to interpret and use outside of formal specifications?
  An old binary stream format is difficult to make sense of using
  a text viewer.  An XML document is usually pretty reasonable
  looking to a human reader even without formal validation and
  processing (of course, plain ASCII is even better for casual
  eyeballs).  Furthermore, some formats are simply a lot easier
  to reconstruct than others, even apart from the presence of
  formal specification.  Imagine an historian 100 years in the
  future who finds two documents: one in MS-Word 97 accompanied
  by an MSDN file-format specification CD, and one in an XML
  format (even one missing a DTD).  This hypothetical historian
  has a lot less work in front of her to reconstruct the XML
  document's contents (look at the many vendors--including
  Microsoft themselves with later versions--that have done a
  poor-to-mediocre job of writing converters even with specs).
  For that matter, imagine yourself five years in the future,
  after your employer has "upgraded" all your workstations to
  MS-Office 2005.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of considerations of portability and technological
  change, I've decided to start a project of getting my past
  academic writing into DocBook format.  I believe this project
  will help in preserving my writing, as well as in making it
  easier to make it available in current and future popular
  document formats (via conversions).
</p>
<h3>What Is Docbook?</h3>
 <p>
  DocBook is an SGML dialect developed by O'Reilly and HaL
  Computer Systems in 1991.  It is currently maintained by the
  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
  Standards (OASIS).  The purpose of DocBook is to describe the
  content of articles, books, technical manuals, and other prose
  documents.  DocBook has a focus on technical writing styles,
  but is general enough to describe everything that goes into
  most styles of prose writing.  An XML variant of the DocBook
  DTD is also available (and is the one that will be discussed in
  this article, inasmuch as small details differ).
</p>
<p>
  The most important thing to keep in mind in understanding
  DocBook is that what is annotated in a DocBook document is
  entirely the <strong>semantics</strong> of the document, not its typography or
  appearance.  This focus on document semantics stands in
  contrast to wordprocessors, HTML, and even TeX. Wordprocessor
  often allow style-sheets that mark conceptual categories like
  "Header, Level 2"--but increasingly most of what they do is
  attempt to deliver "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG).
  And even where style-sheets are used, they are not usually
  uniform across documents.  Doing this brings in all sorts of
  assumptions such as page size and layout, available fonts,
  typestyles of elements, etc.  Most of these assumptions have
  little to do with the actual <strong>concepts</strong> addressed in the
  writing, and almost all of them make it more difficult to adapt
  the document to a different format (whether a different printed
  layout, onscreen display, speech-synthesized versions, indexes
  for web-robots, or whatever).  HTML started out close to
  DocBook (albeit simpler), but increasingly has added
  more-and-more typographic tags; what exists is a hodge-podge of
  semantics and typography (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> versus <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, for example).
</p>
<p>
  As an easy to understand example, many different conceptual
  elements are frequently rendered with italics in printed books.
  Different books use different conventions, but any of these
  DocBook tags might get rendered as italics when actually
  typeset:  <code>&lt;emphasis&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;abbrev&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;citetitle&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;foreignphrase&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;classname&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;email&gt;</code> (and numerous other
  DocBook tags).  Of course, any one of them might <em>not</em> get
  rendered in this manner.  The decision how to render these, and
  other, elements is really accidental to the nature of the
  document considered as concepts; these decisions are the
  business of publishers and book-designers, not of authors (or
  at least they should be).  DocBook gives you the essential
  concepts that go into composition of a prose work, not the
  accidents of how the work is finally rendered (which might be
  many different ways, in fact).  Another advantage to DocBook
  style conceptual markup, besides the seperation of content and
  appearance, is that is lets us do things systematically on
  element types.  For example, you could quickly identify a list
  of every foreign phrase used in a document by searching for all
  occurrences of the tag <code>&lt;foreignphrase&gt;</code> (perhaps you decide a
  glossary is needed for such phrases).  Just looking for
  everything marked as italics in a wordprocessor is much less
  effective in this goal.
</p>
<h3>Ready, Set, Mark Up!</h3>
 <p>
  My first DocBook project will be a big one, but I'll do it in
  increments:  convert my doctoral dissertation to DocBook.
  Besides being rather long as dissertations go, the specific
  document poses several challenges for a documentation system.
  It contains a number of names that require roman diacritics
  (but no non-European character sets); it has footnotes,
  cross-references, page numbering, multiple section levels; it
  uses some diagrams; there is a need to approximate some
  original typography for commentary, and it uses some unusual
  layout for specific effect; it has epigrams, a bibliography,
  appendices, a dedication, an abstract; it uses limited, but
  required, mathematical notations; it references not just books,
  but also URLs and email addresses.  Overall, I happen to have
  written something that will provide a good workout a large
  portion of all the tags in DocBook.  The whole dissertation is
  already available in its original WordPerfect 7 format, and in
  two differently formatted PDF versions.  But none of the
  versions of all that portable or flexible.  DocBook will
  improve things on all grounds (of course, for this article, we
  will only get as far as the markup, not the processing into
  target formats; but eventually everything will be in order).
</p>
<p>
  Enough prefacing, let us create the document:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Mertz Dissertation XML Document</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!-- David Mertz Dissertation --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
               "http://gnosis.cx/download/docbook/4.12/docbookx.dtd" [
    &lt;!ENTITY bookinfo SYSTEM "bookinfo.sgm"&gt;
        &lt;!ENTITY abstract SYSTEM "abstract.sgm"&gt;

    &lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.sgm"&gt;
    &lt;!ENTITY chap3 SYSTEM "chap3.sgm"&gt;
    &lt;!ENTITY chap4 SYSTEM "chap4.sgm"&gt;
    &lt;!ENTITY chap5 SYSTEM "chap5.sgm"&gt;

    &lt;!ENTITY appendix2 SYSTEM "appendix2.sgm"&gt;

    &lt;!ENTITY Zizek "&amp;Zcaron;i&amp;zcaron;ek"&gt;
    &lt;!ENTITY Mocnik "Mo&amp;ccaron;nik"&gt;

]&gt;
&lt;book&gt;
&amp;bookinfo;
&amp;chap1;
&amp;chap2;
&amp;chap3;
&amp;chap4;
&amp;chap5;
&amp;chap6;
&amp;chap7;
&amp;chap8;
&amp;appendix1;
&amp;appendix2;
&amp;biblio;
&lt;/book&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  This first step is mostly planning, obviously.  Creating the
  contents of the component-level elements (e.g. chapters) will
  be the real work.  But by creating entity references to these
  component-level elements, we have divided the creation into more
  manageable chunks (and also made it easier to publish/export
  the individual chapters as their own documents).  What we have
  indicated so far is that the type of document being created is
  a <em>book</em>, and that it will include set of component level
  elements pulled in from external files.
</p>
<p>
  Some entities defined at this top level are not used
  immediately, but only within the included files.  For example,
  the entity <code>&amp;abstract;</code> is only inserted within the
  <code>bookinfo.sgm</code> document.  Similarly with the sections inside
  Chapter 5.  It is a judgement call about what to divide out;
  but my criterion was that I wanted to break into separate files
  the documents I might publish separately.  I will probably make
  adjustments as I extend this DocBook project.  The other type
  of entity I decided to define at this point were some names
  that do not fit in US-ASCII that I know I mention.  I cannot
  type the diacritics directly, but typing e.g.  <code>&amp;Zizek;</code> is an
  inconspicuous approximation of what I actually want.  You could
  also use abbreviations of whole phrases and the like, if you
  wished.
</p>
<h3>Inclusions</h3>
 <p>
  The files that are included using the above master document
  setup will consist of bare document root tags and their
  contents.  No document type declarations or processing
  instructions will be included in the included files (this is
  required).  The document type is already declared in the book
  master document, so we can keep it in one place.  For example,
  the file <code>bookinfo.sgm</code> contains just the following:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Included XML/SGML Subdocument</h4><pre>
&lt;bookinfo&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;The Speculum and The Scalpel&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;subtitle&gt;The Politics of Impotent Representation and
            Non-Represenational Terrorism&lt;/subtitle&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;David&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;surname&gt;Mertz&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/author&gt;
  &amp;abstract;
&lt;/bookinfo&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Similarly, the chapter files each resepectively start and end
  with the <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/chapter&gt;</code> tags.
</p>
<p>
  One advantage of the modular structure laid out is that it is
  easy to pull out individual components for separate
  publication.  For example, I intend to first convert (and
  separately distribute) versions of Chapter 5.  In anticipation
  of doing so, I have created a smaller wrapper for the chapter
  alone:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Chapter Level Subdocument Wrapper</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE chapter PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
               "file://g:/articles/scratch/docbook/4.12/docbookx.dtd" [
  &lt;!ENTITY chap5_1 SYSTEM "chap5_1.sgm"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY chap5_2 SYSTEM "chap5_2.sgm"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY chap5_3 SYSTEM "chap5_3.sgm"&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;chapter&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Hegemony, and Other Passing Fads&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;epigraph&gt;
    &lt;attribution&gt;Gould, 1987b, quoting Gunnar Myrdal, &lt;citetitle&gt;An
      American Dilemma&lt;/citetitle&gt; (1944)&lt;/attribution&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;But there must be still other countless errors of the same
      sort that no living man can yet detect, because of the fog within which
      our type of Western culture envelops us.  Cultural influences have set
      up the assumptions about the mind, the body, and the universe with which
      we begin; pose the questions we ask; influence the facts we seek;
      determine the interpretations we give these facts; and direct our
      reaction to these interpretations and conclusions.&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/epigraph&gt;
&amp;chap5_1;
&amp;chap5_2;
&amp;chap5_3;
&lt;/chapter&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The bulk of the marked-up content is in the three sections
  (each with a top-level <code>sect1</code> as their root).  But I have the
  option of processing the same section content as part of either
  the book-level or chapter-level wrapper (and I will probably
  also pull out Section 2 as an <code>article</code> by itself, which obeys
  the same structure as a <code>chapter</code>).
</p>
<h3>Continuing...</h3>
 <p>
  What this column has begun is only enough for readers (and its
  author) to get a general sense of DocBook.  Subsequent columns
  will address some greater details of the DocBook tags, and how
  they are structured.  In addition, we have yet to get around to
  discussing how to convert DocBook documents to more directly
  readable formats, how to validate them, and how to perform
  processing operations on them.  Stay tuned.
</p>
<p>
  In the meanwhile, it is a good idea to start skimming through
  some of the DocBook reference material in the Resources.
  DocBook has a lot of tags available--probably more than anyone
  is going to remember.  But once you get a sense of what types
  of tags to look for, and how to put them together, the going
  gets easier.  It probably will not hurt to keep a reference on
  your lap while you work with DocBook (even if you use
  specialized tools to help with the editing)
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
 <p>
  By all means, the best place to get started in a more detailed
  understanding of DocBook is.  The ink-on-paper version is:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <cite>DocBook:  The Definitive Guide</cite>, Norman Walsh &amp; Leonard
    Muellner, O'Reilly, Cambridge, MA 1999.

  Standards (OASIS) home page:

</blockquote>
<p>
  In some respect, a format even more portable and time-protected
  than DocBook is plain ASCII--or "smart ASCII" that incorporates
  simple style annotations (in the way evolved on Usenet).  Of
  course, ASCII will not be able to capture all the semantic
  structure of DocBook, but a lot of times you do not need to.
  Project Gutenberg is an example of attempts to preserve and
  utilize texts in this neutral manner:
</p>
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">http://www.gutenberg.net/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  For an important tool with a somewhat overlapping purpose to
  DocBook, TeX is a tool worth learning about.  The focus of TeX
  is closer to typography, but TeX also has many elements of
  semantic markup (especially for mathematics).  A good starting
  point is:
</p>
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.tug.org/">http://www.tug.org/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  My own articles (including the draft of this one) have used a
  similar "smart ASCII" format for their originals.  Markup is
  be automated using the tool Txt2Html (also see the ASCII
  version of this article):

<p>
  The obscure philosophy dissertation I have undertaken to
  convert will probably have minimal interest to most XML
  developers (or even make much sense).  But the actual formats
  used might be of some interest.  The document was written
  originally in WordPerfect 7 (with portions imported from other
  wordprocessor format along the way).  A moderate effort was
  made to use stylesheets for significant elements to make global
  changes easier.  As one prior attempt at (web) publication, I
  output the document to PDF format in a style that
  typographically resembles a printed magazine/journal articles
  more than a submitted thesis.  PDF is not a bad format, but it
  fails to seperate content from layout (or merely does not
  attempt to):
