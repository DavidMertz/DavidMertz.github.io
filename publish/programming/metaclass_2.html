    Our initial developerWorks article on metaclass programming
    prompted quite a bit of feedback, some of it from perplexed
    readers still trying to grasp the subtleties of Python
    metaclasses.  This article revisits the working of
    metaclasses and their relation to other OOP concepts.  We
    contrast class instantiation with inheritance, distinguish
    classmethods and metamethods, and explain and solve metaclass
    conflicts.
</blockquote>
<h3>Metaclasses And Their Discontents</h3>
 <p>
  In our earlier article on metaclass programming in Python, we
  introduced the concept of metaclasses, showed some of their power,
  and demonstrated their use in solving problems such as dynamic
  customization of classes and libraries at run-time.
</p>
<p>
  That article has proved quite popular, but there were ellisions in
  our condensed initial summary.  Certain details in the use of
  metaclasses merit futher explanation.  Based on the feedback of our
  readers and on discussions in comp.lang.python, we decided to
  address some of those trickier point in this second article.  In
  particular, we think the following points are important for any
  programmer wanting to master metaclasses:
</p>
<p>
  (1) Users must understand the differences and interactions between
  metaclass programming and traditional object-oriented programming
  (under both single and multiple inheritance).
</p>
<p>
  (2) Python 2.2 added the built-in functions <code>staticmethod()</code> and
  <code>classmethod()</code> to create methods that do not require an instance
  object during invocation.  To an extent, <em>classmethods</em> overlap in
  purpose with (meta)methods defined in metaclasses.  But the precise
  similarities and differences have also generated confusion in the
  mind of many programmers.
</p>
<p>
  (3) User should understand the cause and the resolution of metatype
  conflicts.  This becomes essential when you want to use more than
  one custom metaclass.  We explain the concept of <em>composition</em> of
  metaclasses.
</p>
<h3>Instantiation Versus Inheritance</h3>
 <p>
  Many programmers are confused about the difference between a
  metaclass and a base class.  At the superficial level of "determing"
  a class, both look similar.  But once you look any deeper, the
  concepts drift apart.
</p>
<p>
  Before presenting some examples, it is worth being precise about
  some nomenclature.  An <em>instance</em> is a Python object that was
  "manufactured" by a class; the class acts as a sort of template for
  the instance.  Every instance is an instance of <em>exactly one</em> class
  (but a class might have multiple instances).  What we often call an
  instance object--or perhaps a "simple instance"<em>-is "final" in the
  sense it cannot act as a template for other objects (but it might
  still be a -factory</em> or a <em>delegate</em>, which serve overlapping
  purposes).
</p>
<p>
  Some instance objects are themselves classes; and all classes are
  instances of a corresponding <em>metaclass</em>.  Even classes only come
  into existence through the instantiation mechanism.  Usually classes
  are instances of the built-in, standard metaclass <code>type</code>; it is only
  when we specify metaclasses other than <code>type</code> that we need to think
  about metaclass programming.  We also call the class used to
  instantiate an object the <em>type</em> of that object.
</p>
<p>
  Running <em>orthogonal</em> to the idea of instantiation is the notion of
  inheritance.  Here, a class can have one or multiple parents, not
  just one unique type.  And parents can have parents, creating a
  transitive subclass relation, conveniently accessible with the
  built-in function <code>issubclass()</code>.  For example, if we define a few
  classes and an istance:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object): a1 = "A"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(object): a2 = "B"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A,B):    a3 = "C(A,B)"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class D(C):      a4 = "D(C)"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = D()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.a5 = "instance d of D"

</pre></div><p>
  Then we can test the relations:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; issubclass(D,C)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; issubclass(D,A)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; issubclass(A,B)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; issubclass(d,D)
[...]
TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class


</pre></div><p>
  The interesting question now--the one necessary for understanding
  the contrast between superclasses and metaclasses--is how an
  attribute like <code>d.attr</code> is resolved.  For simplicity, we discuss
  only the standard look-rule, not the fallback to <code>.__getattr__()</code>.
  The first step in such resolution is to look in <code>d.__dict__</code> for the
  name <code>attr</code>.  If found, that's that; but if not, something fancy
  needs to happen, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; d.__dict__, d.a5, d.a1
({'a5': 'instance d'}, 'instance d', 'A')

</pre></div><p>
  The trick to finding an attribute that isn't attached to an instance
  is to look for it in the class of the instance, then after that in
  all the superclasses.  The order in which superclasses are checked
  is called the <em>method resolution order</em> for the class.  You can look
  at it with the (meta)method <code>.mro()</code> (but only from class objects):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; [k.__name__ for k in d.__class__.mro()]
['D', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'object']

</pre></div><p>
  In other words, the access to <code>d.attr</code> first looks in <code>d.__dict__</code>,
  then in <code>D.__dict__</code>, <code>C.__dict__</code>, <code>A.__dict__</code>, <code>B.__dict__</code>, and
  finally in <code>object.__dict__</code>.  If the name is not found in any of
  those places, an <code>AttributeError</code> is raised.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that metaclasses were never mentioned in the lookup procedure.
</p>
<h3>Metaclasses Versus Ancestors</h3>
 <p>
  Here is a simple example of normal inheritance.  We define a <code>Noble</code>
  base class, with subclasses such as <code>Prince</code>, <code>Duke</code>, <code>Baron</code>, etc.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; for s in "Power Wealth Beauty".split(): exec '%s="%s"'%(s,s)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Noble(object):      # ...in fairy tale world
...     attributes = Power, Wealth, Beauty
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Prince(Noble):
...     pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; Prince.attributes
('Power', 'Wealth', 'Beauty')

</pre></div><p>
  The class <code>Prince</code> inherits the attributes of the class <code>Noble</code>.  An
  instance of <code>Prince</code> still follows the lookup chain discussed above:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; charles=Prince()
&gt;&gt;&gt; charles.attributes        # ...remember, not the real world
('Power', 'Wealth', 'Beauty')

</pre></div><p>
  If the <code>Duke</code> class should happen to have a custom metaclasses, it
  can obtain some attributes that way:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Nobility(type): attributes = Power, Wealth, Beauty
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Duke(object): __metaclass__ = Nobility
...

</pre></div><p>
  As well as being a class, <code>Duke</code> is an instance of the metaclass
  <code>Nobility</code>--attribute lookup proceeds as with any object:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; Duke.attributes
('Power', 'Wealth', 'Beauty')

</pre></div><p>
  But <code>Nobility</code> is <em>not</em> a superclass of <code>Duke</code>, so there is no
  reason why an <em>instance</em> of <code>Duke</code> would find <code>Nobility.attributes</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; Duke.mro()
[&lt;class '__main__.Duke'&gt;, &lt;type 'object'&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; earl = Duke()
&gt;&gt;&gt; earl.attributes
[...]
AttributeError: 'Duke' object has no attribute 'attributes'

</pre></div><p>
  The availability of metaclass attributes is not transitive; i.e. the
  attributes of a metaclass are available to its instances, but not to
  the instances of the instances.  Just this is the main difference
  between metaclasses and superclasses.  A diagram emphasizes the
  orthogonality of inheritence and instantiation:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/instantiation-vs-inheritance.gif" alt="Figure 1--Instantiation versus Inheritance">
</p>
<p>
  Since <code>earl</code> still has a class, you can indirectly retrieve the
  attributes, however:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; earl.__class__.attributes

</pre></div><p>
  Figure 1 contrasts simple cases where <em>either</em> inheritance or
  metaclasses are involved, but not both.  Sometimes, however, a class
  C has both a custom metaclass M and a base class B:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class M(type):
...     a = 'M.a'
...     x = 'M.x'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(object): a = 'B.a'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(B): __metaclass__=M
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; c=C()

</pre></div><p>
  Graphically:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/superclass-and-metaclass.gif" alt="Figure 2--Combined Superclass and Metaclass">
</p>
<p>
  From the prior explanation, we could imagine that <code>C.a</code> would
  resolve to <em>either</em> <code>M.a</code> or <code>B.a</code>.  As it turns out, lookup on a
  class follows its MRO before it looks in its instantiating
  metaclass:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.a, C.x
('B.a', 'M.x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.a
'B.a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.x
[...]
AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'x'

</pre></div><p>
  You can still enforce a attribute value using a metaclass, you just
  need to set it on the class object being instantiated rather than as
  an attribute of the metaclass:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class M(type):
...     def __init__(cls, *args):
...         cls.a = 'M.a'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(B): __metaclass__=M
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.a, C().a
('M.a', 'M.a')


</pre></div><h3>More On Class Magic</h3>
 <p>
  The fact that the instantiation constraint is weaker than the
  inheritance constraint is essential for implementing the special
  methods like <code>.__new__()</code>, <code>.__init__()</code>, <code>.__str__()</code>, etc.  We
  will discuss the <code>.__str__()</code> method; an analysis is similar for the
  other special methods.
</p>
<p>
  Readers probably know that the printed representation of a class
  object can be modified by overring its <code>.__str__()</code> method.  In the
  same sense, the printed representation of a class can be modified by
  overring the <code>.__str__()</code> methods of its metaclass.  For instance:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Printable(type):
...    def __str__(cls):
...        return "This is class %s" % cls.__name__
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object): __metaclass__ = Printable
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print C       # equivalent to print Printable.__str__(C)
This is class C
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c       # equivalent to print C.__str__(c)
&lt;C object at 0x40380a6c&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The situation can be represented with the following diagram:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/metaclasses-and-magic.gif" alt="Figure 3--Metaclasses and Magic Methods">
</p>
<p>
  From the previous discussion, it is clear that the <code>.__str__()</code>
  method in <code>Printable</code> cannot override the <code>.__str__()</code> method in C,
  which is inherited from <code>object</code> and therefore has precedence;
  printing <code>c</code> still gives the standard result.
</p>
<p>
  If C inherited its <code>.__str__()</code> method from <code>Printable</code> rather than
  from <code>object</code>, it would cause a problem:  <code>C</code> instances do not have
  a <code>.__name__</code> attribute and printing <code>c</code> would generate an error.
  Of course, you could still define a <code>.__str__()</code> method in <code>C</code> that
  would change the way <code>c</code> prints.
</p>
<h3>Classmethods Vs. Metamethods</h3>
 <p>
  Another common confusion arise between Python classmethods and
  methods defined in a metaclass, best called <em>metamethods</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Consider this example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class M(Printable):
...     def mm(cls):
...         return "I am a metamethod of %s" % cls.__name__
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     __metaclass__=M
...     def cm(cls):
...         return "I am a classmethod of %s" % cls.__name__
...     cm=classmethod(cm)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; c=C()

</pre></div><p>
  Part of the confusion is due to the fact that in the Smalltalk
  terminology, <code>C.mm</code> would be called a "class method of <code>C</code>."
  Python classmethods are a different beast, however.
</p>
<p>
  The metamethod "mm" can be invoked both from either the metaclass or
  from the class, but not from the instance.  The classmethod can be
  called both from the class and from its instances (but does not
  exist in the metaclass).
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print M.mm(C)
I am a metamethod of C
&gt;&gt;&gt; print C.mm()
I am a metamethod of C
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c.mm()
[...]
AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'mm'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print C.cm()
I am a classmethod of C
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c.cm()
I am a classmethod of C

</pre></div><p>
  Also, the metamethod is retrieved by <code>dir(M)</code> but not by <code>dir(C)</code>
  whereas the classmethod is retrieved by <code>dir(C)</code> and <code>dir(c)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  You can only call the metaclass method that are defined in the
  class MRO by dispatching on the metaclass (built-ins like <code>print</code> do
  this behind the scenes):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; print C.__str__()
[...]
TypeError: descriptor '__str__' of 'object' object needs an argument
&gt;&gt;&gt; print M.__str__(C)
This is class C

</pre></div><p>
  It is important to notice that this dispatch conflict is not limited
  to magic methods.  If we change <code>C</code> by adding an attribute <code>C.mm</code>,
  the same issue exists (it does not matter if the name is a regular
  method, classmethod, staticmethod, or simple attribute):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.mm=lambda self: "I am a regular method of %s" % self.__class__
&gt;&gt;&gt; print C.mm()
[...]
TypeError: unbound method &lt;lambda&gt;() must be called with
    C instance as first argument (got nothing instead)


</pre></div><h3>Conflicting Metaclasses</h3>
 <p>
  Once you work seriously with metaclasses, you will be bitten at
  least once by metaclass/metatype conflicts.  Consider a class <code>A</code>
  with metaclass <code>M_A</code> and a class <code>B</code> with metaclass <code>M_B</code>; suppose
  we derive <code>C</code> from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.  The question is:  what is the
  metaclass of <code>C</code>?  Is it <code>M_A</code> or <code>M_B</code>?
</p>
<p>
  The correct answer (see "Putting metaclasses to work" for a
  discussion) is <code>M_C</code>, where <code>M_C</code> is a metaclass that inherits from
  <code>M_A</code> and <code>M_B</code>, as in the following graph:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/metaclass-conflict.gif" alt="Figure 4--Avoiding the Metaclass Conflict">
</p>
<p>
  However, Python does not (yet) automatically create <code>M_C</code>.  Instead,
  it raises a <code>TypeError</code>, warning the programmer of the conflict:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class M_A(type): pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class M_B(type): pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object): __metaclass__ = M_A
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(object): __metaclass__ = M_B
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A,B): pass    # Error message less specific under 2.2
[...]
TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must
    be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases

</pre></div><p>
  The metatype conflict can be avoided by manually creating the needed
  metaclass for <code>C</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; M_AM_B = type("M_AM_B", (M_A,M_B), {})
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A,B): __metaclass__ = M_AM_B
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(C)
&lt;class 'M_AM_B'&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The resolution of metatype conflicts becomes more complicated when
  you wish to "inject" additional metaclasses into a class, beyond
  those in its ancestors.  As well, depending on the metaclasses of
  parent classes, redundant metaclasses can occur--both identical
  metaclasses in different ancestors and superclass/subclass
  relationships among metaclasses.  The module <em><code>noconflict</code></em> is
  available to help users resolve these issues in a robust and
  automatic way (see Resources).
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  There are quite a number of warnings and corner cases discussed in
  this article.  Working with metaclasses requires a certain degree of
  trial-and-error before the behavior becomes wholly intuitive.
  However, the issues are by no means intractable--this fairly short
  article touches on most of the pitfalls.  Play with the cases
  yourself.  You will find, at the end of the day, that whole new
  realms of program generalization are available with metaclasses; the
  gains are well worth the few dangers.
