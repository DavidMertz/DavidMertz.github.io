<h1>Charming Python #b24: Decorators Make Magic Easy</h1>

<blockquote>
    Python has long made metaprogramming possible, but each Python
    version has added slightly different--and not quite
    compatible--wrinkles to exactly how you accomplish metaprogramming
    tricks. Playing with first-class function objects has long been
    around, as have techniques for peaking and poking at magic
    attributes. With version 2.2, Python grew a custom metaclass
    mechanism that went a long way, but at the cost of melting users'
    brains.  Most recently, with version 2.4, Python has grown
    "decorators", which are the newest--and by far the most
    user-friendly way, so far--to perform most metaprogramming.
</blockquote>
<h3>Doing A Lot By Doing Very Little</h3>
 <p>
  Decorators have something with previous meta-programming abstractions
  introduced to Python: they do not actually do anything you could not
  do without them.  As Michele Simionato and I pointed out in earlier
  <cite>Charming Python</cite> installments, it was possible even in Python 1.5 to
  manipulate Python class creation without the "metaclass" hook.
</p>
<p>
  Decorators are similar in their ultimate banality.  All a decorator
  does is modify the function or method that is defined immediately
  after the decorator.  This was always possible, but the capability was
  particularly motivated by the introduction of the <code>classmethod()</code> and
  <code>staticmethod()</code> built-in functions in Python 2.2.  In the older
  style, you would use, e.g., a <code>classmethod()</code> call as follows:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Typical "old style" classmethod</h4><pre>
class C:
    def foo(cls, y):
        print "classmethod", cls, y
    foo = classmethod(foo)

</pre></div><p>
  Though <code>classmethod()</code> is a built-in, there is nothing unique about
  it, you could also have "rolled your own" method transforming
  function, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Typical "old style" method transform</h4><pre>
def enhanced(meth):
    def new(self, y):
        print "I am enhanced"
        return meth(self, y)
    return new
class C:
    def bar(self, x):
        print "some method says:", x
    bar = enhanced(bar)

</pre></div><p>
  All that a decorator does is let you avoid repeating the method name,
  and put the decorator near the first mention of the method in its
  definition.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Typical "old style" classmethod</h4><pre>
class C:
    @classmethod
    def foo(cls, y):
        print "classmethod", cls, y
    @enhanced
    def bar(self, x):
        print "some method says:", x

</pre></div><p>
  Decorators work for regular functions too, in just the same manner as
  for methods in classes.  It is surprising just how much easier such a
  simple, and strictly-speaking unnecessary, change in syntax winds up
  making things work better, and makes reasoning about programs easier.
  Decorators can be chained together by listing more than one prior to a
  function of method definition; good sense urges avoiding chaining <em>too
  many</em> decorators together, but several are sometimes sensible, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Chained decorators</h4><pre>
@synchronized
@logging
def myfunc(arg1, arg2, ...):
    # ...do something
# decorators are equivalent to ending with:
#    myfunc = synchronized(logging(myfunc))
# Nested in that declaration order

</pre></div><p>
  Being simply syntax sugar, decorators let you shoot yourself in the
  foot if you are so inclined.  A decorator is just a function that
  takes at least one argument--it is up the programmer of the decorator
  to make sure that what it returns is still a meaningful function or
  method that does enough of what the original function did for the
  connection to be useful.  For example, a couple syntactic misuses are:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Bad decorator that does not even return function</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def spamdef(fn):
...     print "spam, spam, spam"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; @spamdef
... def useful(a, b):
...     print a**2 + b**2
...
spam, spam, spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful(3, 4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

</pre></div><p>
  A decorator might return a function, but one that is not meaningfully
  associated with the undecorated function:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Decorator whose function ignores passed-in function</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def spamrun(fn):
...     def sayspam(*args):
...         print "spam, spam, spam"
...     return sayspam
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; @spamrun
... def useful(a, b):
...     print a**2 + b**2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful(3,4)
spam, spam, spam

</pre></div><p>
  Finally, a better behaved decorator will in some way enhance or modify
  the action of the undecorated function:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Decorator that modifies behavior of undecorated func</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def addspam(fn):
...     def new(*args):
...         print "spam, spam, spam"
...         return fn(*args)
...     return new
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; @addspam
... def useful(a, b):
...     print a**2 + b**2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful(3,4)
spam, spam, spam
25

</pre></div><p>
  One might quibble over just how useful <code>useful()</code> is, or whether
  <code>addspam()</code> is really such a good <em>enhancement</em>, but at least the
  mechnisms follow the pattern you will typically see in useful
  decorators.
</p>
<h3>Introduction To High Level Abstraction</h3>
 <p>
  Most of what metaclasses are used for, in my experience, is modifying
  the methods contained in a class once it is instantiated. Decorators
  do not currently let you modify class instantiation <em>per se</em>, but they
  can massage the methods that are attached to the class. This does not
  let you dynamically add or remove methods or class attributes during
  instantiation, but it does let the methods change their behavior
  depending on conditions in the environment at runtime. Now
  technically, a decorator applies when a <code>class</code> statement is run,
  which for top-level classes is closer to "compile time" than to
  "runtime". But arranging runtime determination of decorators is as
  simple as creating a class factory.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Robust, but deeply nested, decorator</h4><pre>
def arg_sayer(what):
    def what_sayer(meth):
        def new(self, *args, **kws):
            print what
            return meth(self, *args, **kws)
        return new
    return what_sayer

def FooMaker(word):
    class Foo(object):
        @arg_sayer(word)
        def say(self): pass
    return Foo()

foo1 = FooMaker('this')
foo2 = FooMaker('that')
print type(foo1),; foo1.say()  # prints: &lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt; this
print type(foo2),; foo2.say()  # prints: &lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt; that

</pre></div><p>
  The <code>@arg_sayer()</code> example goes through a lot of contortions to obtain
  a rather limited result; but it is worthwhile for the several things
  it illustrates.
</p>
<blockquote>
    * The <code>Foo.say()</code> method has different behaviors for different
    instances.  In the actual example, the difference only amounts to a
    data value that could easily be varied by other means; but in
    principle, the decorator could have completely rewritten the method
    based on runtime decisions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * The undecorated <code>Foo.say()</code> method in this case in a simple
    placeholder, with the entire behavior determined by the decorator.
    However, in other cases, the decorator might <em>combine</em> the
    undecorated method behavior with some new capabilities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * As already observed, the modification of <code>Foo.say()</code> is determined
    strictly at runtime, via the use of the <code>FooMaker()</code> class factory.
    Probably more typical is using decorators on top-level defined
    class, which depend only on conditions available at compile-time
    (which are often adequate).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * The decorator is parameterized.  Or rather <code>arg_sayer()</code> itself is
    not really a decorator at all; rather, the function <em>returned by</em>
    <code>arg_sayer()</code>, namely <code>what_sayer()</code>, is a decorator function that
    uses a closure to encapsulate its data.  Paramaterized decorators
    are common, but they wind up needing functions nested three-levels
    deep.
</blockquote>
<h3>Marching Into Metaclass Territory</h3>
 <p>
  I told you in the last section that decorators could not completely
  replace the metaclass hook since they only modified methods rather
  than add or delete methods.  That was actually not quite true.  A
  decorator, being a Python function, can do absolutely anything other
  Python code can.  By decorating the <code>.__new__()</code> method of a class,
  even a placeholder version of it, you can in fact change what methods
  attach to a class.  I have not seen this pattern "in the wild", but I
  think it has a certain explicitness, perhaps even as an improvement on
  the <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> assignment:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>A decorator to add and remove methods</h4><pre>
def flaz(self): return 'flaz'     # Silly utility method
def flam(self): return 'flam'     # Another silly method

def change_methods(new):
    "Warning: Only decorate the __new__() method with this decorator"
    if new.__name__ != '__new__':
        return new  # Return an unchanged method
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kws):
        cls.flaz = flaz
        cls.flam = flam
        if hasattr(cls, 'say'): del cls.say
        return super(cls.__class__, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kws)
    return __new__

class Foo(object):
    @change_methods
    def __new__(): pass
    def say(self): print "Hi me:", self

foo = Foo()
print foo.flaz()  # prints: flaz
foo.say()         # AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'say'

</pre></div><p>
  In the sample <code>change_methods()</code> decorator, some fixed methods are
  added and removed, fairly pointlessly. A more realistic case would use
  some patterns from the previous section. For example, a parameterized
  decorator could accept a data structure indicating methods to be added
  or removed; or perhaps some feature of the environment like a database
  query could make this decision. This manipulation of attached methods
  could also be wrapped in a function factory as before, deferring the
  final decision until runtime. These latter techniques might even be
  more versatile than <code><cite>_metaclass_</cite></code> assignment, for example, you might
  call and enhanced <code>change_methods()</code> like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>class Foo(object):
    @change_methods(add=(foo, bar, baz), remove=(fliz, flam))
    def __new__(): pass

</pre></div><h3>Changing A Call Model</h3>
 <p>
  The most typical examples you will see discussed for decorators can
  probably be described as making a function or method "do something
  extra" while it does its basic job.  For example, on places like the
  Python cookbook website you might see decorators to add capabilities
  like tracing, logging, memoization/caching, thread locking, output
  redirection.  Related to these modifications--but in a slightly
  different spirit--are "before" and "after" modifications.  One
  interesting possibility for before/after decoration is checking the
  types of arguments to a function and the return value from a function.
  Presumably such a <code>type_check()</code> decorator would raise an exception or
  take some corrective action if the types are not as expected.
</p>
<p>
  In somewhat the same vein as before/after decorators, I got to
  thinking about the "elementwise" application of functions that is
  characteristic of the R programming language, and of <em><code>NumPy</code></em>.  In
  these languages, numeric functions generally apply to <em>each element</em>
  in a sequence of elements, but also to an individual number.
</p>
<p>
  Certainly the <code>map()</code> function, list-comprehensions, and more recently
  generator-comprehensions, let you do elementwise application.  But
  these require minor work-arounds to get R-like behavior: the type of
  sequence returned by <code>map()</code> is always a list; and the call will fail
  if you pass it a single element rather than a sequence, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import sqrt
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(sqrt, (4, 16, 25))
[2.0, 4.0, 5.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(sqrt, 144)
TypeError: argument 2 to map() must support iteration

</pre></div><p>
  It is not hard to create a decorator that "enhances" a regular
  numerical function:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Converting a function to an elementwise function</h4><pre>
def elementwise(fn):
    def newfn(arg):
        if hasattr(arg,'__getitem__'):  # is a Sequence
            return type(arg)(map(fn, arg))
        else:
            return fn(arg)
    return newfn

@elementwise
def compute(x):
    return x**3 - 1

print compute(5)        # prints: 124
print compute([1,2,3])  # prints: [0, 7, 26]
print compute((1,2,3))  # prints: (0, 7, 26)

</pre></div><p>
  It is not hard, of course, to write a <code>compute()</code> function that simply
  builds in the different return types; the decorator only takes a few
  lines, after all. But in what might be described as a nod to
  aspect-oriented programming, this example lets us <em>separate concerns</em>
  that operate at different levels. We might write a variety of numeric
  computation functions, and wish to turn them each into elementwise
  call models without thinking about the details of argument type
  testing and return value type coercion.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>elementwise()</code> decorator works equally well for any function that
  might operate on either an individual thing or on a sequence of things
  (while preserving the sequence type). As an exercise, readers might
  try working out how to allow the same decorated call to also accept
  and return iterators (hint: it is easy if you just iterate a completed
  elementwise computation, it is less straightforward to do lazily if
  and only if an iterator object is passed in).
</p>
<p>
  Most good decorators you will encounter have much of this paradigm of
  combining orthogonal concerns.  Traditional object-oriented
  programming, especially in languages like Python that allow multiple
  inheritance, attempt to modularize concerns with an inheritance
  hierarchy.  However, merely getting some methods from one ancestor,
  and other methods from other ancestors requires a conception in which
  concerns are much more separated than they are in aspect-oriented
  thinking.  Taking best advantage of generators involves thinking about
  issues somewhat differently than does mix-and-matching methods: <em>each</em>
  method might be made to work in different ways depending on concerns
  that are outside of the "heart" of the method itself.
</p>
<h3>Decorating Your Decorators</h3>
 <p>
  Before end this installment, I would like to point readers to a really
  wonderful Python module called <em><code>decorator</code></em> written by my sometimes
  co-author Michele Simionato.  This module makes developing decorators
  much nicer.  Having a certain reflexive elegance, the main component
  of the <em><code>decorator</code></em> module is a decorator called <code>decorator()</code>.
  A function decorated with <code>@decorator</code> can be written in a simpler
  manner than one without it.
</p>
<p>
  Michele has produced quite good documentation of his module, so I will
  not attempt to reproduce it; but I would like to point out the basic
  problems it solves.  There are two main benefits to the <em><code>decorator</code></em>
  module.  On the one hand it lets you write decorators with fewer
  levels of nesting than you would otherwise need ("flat is better than
  nested"); but more interesting possibly is the fact it makes decorated
  functions actually match their undecorated version in metadata, which
  my examples have not.  For example, recalling the somewhat silly
  "tracing" decorator <code>addspam()</code> that I used above:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>How a naive decorator corrupts metadata</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def useful(a, b): return a**2 + b**2
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful.__name__
'useful'
&gt;&gt;&gt; from inspect import getargspec
&gt;&gt;&gt; getargspec(useful)
(['a', 'b'], None, None, None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @addspam
... def useful(a, b): return a**2 + b**2
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful.__name__
'new'
&gt;&gt;&gt; getargspec(useful)
([], 'args', None, None)

</pre></div><p>
  While the decorated function <em>does</em> its enhanced job, a closer look
  shows it is not quite right, especially to code-analysis tools or
  IDEs that care about these sorts of details.  Using <em><code>decorator</code></em>, we
  can improve matters:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from decorator import decorator
&gt;&gt;&gt; @decorator
... def addspam(f, *args, **kws):
...     print "spam, spam, spam"
...     return f(*args, **kws)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @addspam
... def useful(a, b): return a**2 + b**2
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful.__name__
'useful'
&gt;&gt;&gt; getargspec(useful)
(['a', 'b'], None, None, None)

</pre></div><p>
  This looks better both to write the decorator in the first place, and
  in its behavior preserving metadata.  Of course, reading the full
  incantations that Michele used to develop the module brings you back
  into brain-melting territory; we can leave that for cosmologists like
  Dr. Simionato.
