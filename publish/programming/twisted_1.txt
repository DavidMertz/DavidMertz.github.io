    Twisted Matrix is an increasingly popular pure-Python
    framework for programming network services and applications.
    While there are a large number of loosely-coupled modular
    components within Twisted Matrix, a central concept to the
    framework is the idea of non-blocking asynchronous servers.
    This style of programming is novel for developers accustomed
    to threading or forking servers, but also allows for great
    efficiency under heavy loads.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sorting through Twisted Matrix is reminiscent of the old story
  about blind men and elephants. Twisted Matrix has many
  capabilities within it, and it takes a bit of a gestalt switch
  to -get- a good sense of why they are all there.  In fact, with
  this first installment, I am probably only halfway toward
  getting my mind fully around Twisted Matrix. Readers and I can
  work through it together.

  One of the strengths of recent versions of Python is that they
  come with "batteries included"--that is, the standard
  distribution includes modules to do just about everything you
  want to accomplish in most programming tasks. For the most part,
  when you want a 3rd party Python module or package, it is to
  accomplish some specialized and unusual task. Twisted Matrix is
  one of few exceptions to the pattern described--Twisted is a
  well-designed and general-purpose collection of modules for
  performing all manner of network programming, in ways not
  easily facilitated by Python's standard library.

  It is not quite true that Python's standard library lacks
  support for asynchronous, non-blocking network applications.
  The module [asyncore] provides basic support for switching
  among I/O channels within a single thread. But Twisted Matrix
  takes the style to a much higher level, and provides a huge
  collection of pre-built and reusable protocols, interfaces and
  components.

A FIRST SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The documentation that accompanies Twisted Matrix is quite
  extensive, but hard to get a handle on. Let us start with a
  simple server, and build on that by several steps. In a recent
  developerWorks tip, I demonstrated an XML-based "weblog server"
  that presents to a client a stream of records about the latest
  hits to a web server.  The XML aspect is not important here,
  but the use of [SocketServer] and its ThreadingTCPServer class
  is useful as a baseline.  This pre-Twisted server consists of:

      #--------------- SocketServer-weblog.py ------------------#
      from SocketServer import BaseRequestHandler, ThreadingTCPServer
      from time import sleep
      import sys, socket
      from webloglib import log_fields, hit_tag

      class WebLogHandler(BaseRequestHandler):
          def handle(self):
              print "Connected from", self.client_address
              self.request.sendall('<hits>')
              try:
                  while True:
                      for hit in LOG.readlines():
                          self.request.sendall(hit_tag % log_fields(hit))
                      sleep(5)
              except socket.error:
                  self.request.close()
              print "Disconnected from", self.client_address

      if __name__=='__main__':
          global LOG
          LOG = open('access-log')
          LOG.seek(0, 2)     # Start at end of current access log
          srv = ThreadingTCPServer(('',8888), WebLogHandler)
          srv.serve_forever()

  Other than that overhead of its per-client thread creation, a
  notable feature of the [SocketServer] based sever is its use of
  a blocking call to 'time.sleep()' within its handler.  For
  Twisted Matrix' non-blocking 'select()' loop, such a block is
  impermissible.

  A first non-blocking approach pushes any artificial delays onto
  the client, and lets the client specifically request each new
  batch of weblog records (and also sends a message to indicate
  their absence, rather than send nothing).  This Twisted server
  looks like:

      #----------------- twisted-weblog-1.py -------------------#
      from twisted.internet import reactor
      from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory
      from webloglib import hit_tag, log_fields

      class WebLog(Protocol):
          def connectionMade(self):
              print "Connected from", self.transport.client
              self.transport.write('<hits>')
          def dataReceived(self, data):
              newhits = LOG.readlines()
              if not newhits:
                  self.transport.write('<none/>')
              for hit in newhits:
                  self.transport.write(hit_tag % log_fields(hit))
          def connectionLost(self, reason):
              print "Disconnected from", self.transport.client

      factory = Factory()
      factory.protocol = WebLog

      if __name__=='__main__':
          global LOG
          LOG = open('access-log')
          LOG.seek(0, 2)     # Start at end of current access log
          reactor.listenTCP(8888, factory)
          reactor.run()

  Readers should refer to my prior tip for details on the client
  application.  But the following change should be noted.  The
  main client loop adds two lines:

      #------------ Enhanced (blocking) client loop ------------#
      while 1:
          xml_data = sock.recv(8192)
          parser.feed(xml_data)
          sleep(5)          # Delay before requesting new records
          sock.send('NEW?') # Send signal to indicate readiness


THE PARTS OF A TWISTED SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A Twisted Matrix server consists of several modular elements.
  At a bytestream level, a server implements a protocol, often by
  inheriting from 'twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol' or from
  some previously specialized child of it.  For example, provided
  subclasses (in 'twisted.protocols') include 'dns', 'ftp',
  'gnutella', 'http', 'nntp', 'shoutcast', and many others.
  Basically, a protocol should know how to handle making and
  losing connections, and receiving and sending data within a
  connection.  These responsibilities are not much different than
  in a [SocketServer] based server, except in being slightly
  more modular in defining methods for each element.

  The next level of a Twisted Matrix server is a factory.  In our
  'twisted-weblog-1.py' example, the factory really does nothing
  besides store a protocol.  In a more sophisticated server,
  however, a factory is a good place to perform initialization
  and finalization related to a protocol sever.  And probably of
  greatest interest, a factory can be persisted within
  -applications- (we will see those soon).

  Neither a protocol or a factory knows anything about the
  network the server runs on.  Instead, a -reactor- is a class
  that actually listens on a network (utilizing a factory
  instance for its protocol).  Basically, a reactor is just a
  loop that listens on a given port and network interface (which
  one is chosen by calling a method like '.listenTCP()',
  '.listenSSL()' or '.listenUDP()').  The thing to understand is
  that the basic reactor in Twisted Matrix, 'SelectReactor', runs
  in a single thread--each connection is checked for new data,
  and the data is delivered to the relevant protocol object.  An
  upshot is that a protocol object is -really- not allowed to
  block, or even just take too long to complete (protocols must
  be programmed appropriately).


AN ENHANCED SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Let us try to enhance the Twisted weblog server so that it
  follows the pattern of 'SocketServer-weblog.py' in feeding new
  records to clients without the need for repeated requests from
  those clients.  The problem here is inserting a 'time.sleep()'
  call into a method of 'WebLog(Protocol)' causes it to block,
  and so is not allowed.  While we are at it, notice that the
  prior servers probably do the wrong thing in that they feed
  each new batch of records only to one client.  Presumably, if
  you want to allow multiple clients to monitor a weblog, you
  want them all to receive ongoing updates.

  The way you delay actions in Twisted Matrix without blocking is
  to add callbacks to a reactor, using the '.callLater()' method.
  A callback added this way is added to the queue of events to
  service, but it will not actually be processed until after a
  specified delay.  Putting both changes together, an enhanced
  weblog server looks like:

      #----------------- twisted-weblog-1.py -------------------#
      from twisted.internet import reactor
      from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory
      from webloglib import hit_tag, log_fields
      import time

      class WebLog(Protocol):
          def connectionMade(self):
              print "Connected from", self.transport.client
              self.transport.write('<hits>')
              self.ts = time.time()
              self.newHits()
          def newHits(self):
              for hit in self.factory.records:
                  if self.ts <= hit[0]:
                      self.transport.write(hit_tag % log_fields(hit[1]))
              self.ts = time.time()
              reactor.callLater(5, self.newHits)
          def connectionLost(self, reason):
              print "Disconnected from", self.transport.client

      class WebLogFactory(Factory):
          protocol = WebLog
          def __init__(self, fname):
              self.fname = fname
              self.records = []
          def startFactory(self):
              self.fp = open(self.fname)
              self.fp.seek(0, 2) # Start at end of current access log
              self.updateRecords()
          def updateRecords(self):
              ts = time.time()
              for rec in self.fp.readlines():
                  self.records.append((ts, rec))
              self.records = self.records[-100:]  # Only keep last 100 hits
              reactor.callLater(1, self.updateRecords)
          def stopFactory(self):
              self.fp.close()

      if __name__=='__main__':
          reactor.listenTCP(8888, WebLogFactory('access-log'))
          reactor.run()

  In this case, we define a custom factory and move some of the
  initialization from the '__main__' block to the factory. Notice
  also that the clients for this server need not (and should not)
  sleep or send new requests--in fact, I use the exact client
  application I discussed in my mentioned XML Zone tip.

  The factory and the protocol use the same technique in their
  custom methods '.updatedRecords()' and '.newHits()',
  respectively. That is if a method wants to run periodically, its
  last line can schedule it to run again at a specified delay. On
  its face, this pattern looks a lot like recursion--but it is not,
  in fact (moreover, the repeat scheduling need not occur on the
  last line; it just makes sense there). The method '.newHits()',
  for example, simply lets the controlling reactor loop know that
  it wants to be called in another 5 seconds, but the method itself
  terminates. There is no requirement that a method schedule only
  itself--it can schedule whatever it wants to occur, and
  functions quite apart from factory or protocol methods can be
  added to a reactor loop, if you wish.

PERSISTENCE AND SCHEDULING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As well as 'reactor.callLater()' scheduling, Twisted Matrix
  contains a general class 'twisted.internet.defer.Deferred'. In
  essense, deferreds are a generalization of scheduled callbacks,
  but allow techniques such as chaining dependent callbacks and
  handling error conditions in these chains. The idea behind a
  'Deferred' object is that when you call a method, rather than
  wait for its results (which may take a while to arrive), the
  method can immediately return a 'Deferred' object which the
  reactor/scheduler can call again later, when results are expected
  to be available.

  I have not really played with 'Deferred' objects yet, but it
  feels like getting them right will be slightly tricky.  If you
  need to wait on a blocking action-say the results from a
  remote database query--it is not clear exactly how long you
  will need to wait for results to be available.  'Deferred'
  objects -do- have a timeout mechanism, but I will have to come
  back to that in a later installment.  Interested readers should
  at least know that the Twisted Matrix developers have attempted
  to provide a standard API for wrapping blocking actions.  Of
  course, the worst case is to fall back to using threads for
  blocking actions that really cannot be converted into
  asynchronous callbacks.

  Another important element to Twisted Matrix servers is their easy
  support for persistence. A reactor is a loop that monitors and
  responds to I/O events. An -application- is much like an enhanced
  reactor that is able to pickle its state for later re-starting.
  Moreover, applications can be statefully saved into ".tap" files,
  and can be managed and daemonized using the tool 'twistd'. Let me
  present a simple example that illustrates the usage (modelled on
  the Twisted documentation's 'OneTimeKey' example).  This server
  delivers distinct Fibonacci numbers to all interested clients,
  without repeating numbers between them--even if the server is
  stopped and started:

      #-------------------- fib_server.py ----------------------#
      from twisted.internet.app import Application
      from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory

      class Fibonacci(Protocol):
          "Serve a sequence of Fibonacci numbers to all requesters"
          def dataReceived(self, data):
              self.factory.new = self.factory.a + self.factory.b
              self.transport.write('%d' % self.factory.new)
              self.factory.a = self.factory.b
              self.factory.b = self.factory.new

      def main():
          import fib_server    # Use script as namespace
          f = Factory()
          f.protocol = fib_server.Fibonacci
          f.a, f.b = 1, 1
          application = Application("Fibonacci")
          application.listenTCP(8888, f)
          application.save()

      if '__main__' == __name__:
          main()

  You can see that mostly all we have changed is replacing
  'reactor' with 'application' throughout. While the class
  'Application' also has a '.run()' method, we use its '.save()'
  method to create a 'Fibonacci.tap' file. Running this server is
  done as:

      % python fib_server.py
      % twistd -f Fibonacci.tap
      ...let server run, then shut it down...
      % kill `cat twistd.pid`
      ...re-start server where it left off...
      % twistd -f Fibonacci-shutdown.tap
      ...serve numbers where we left off...

  The client that connects to this server should use a
  'time.sleep()' in its loop if it only wants a new number
  intermittently rather than as fast as possible. Obviously, a more
  useful server can provide a more intersting stateful datastream.

WHAT NEXT?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This article looked at fairly low-level details of Twisted
  Matrix--defining custom protocols, and the like.  But Twisted
  Matrix exists at many levels--including high-level templating
  for web services and other common protocls.  In the next
  installments of this series, we will start to look at web
  services specifically, and pick up some miscellaneous threads
  that were left dangling.
