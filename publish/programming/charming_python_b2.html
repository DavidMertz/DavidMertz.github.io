<h1>Charming Python: Installment #b2</h1>
<h2>Anygui: The universal graphical Python interface to come</h2>

<blockquote>
    A very interesting project in the Python world has entered
    early development.  The <em><code>anygui</code></em> project is intended as a
    wrapper API for a large number of underlying graphic
    toolkits.  Once fully developed, a Python programmer will be
    able to call a common <em><code>anygui</code></em> function--for example, to create
    a window--then have the "best available" toolkit do the work.
    On Windows, the Win32 API might be used (or wxWindows);
    on MacOS, native calls; on BeOS, Bethon; on Linux, TKinter or
    GTK; on a telnet screen, ncurses--all depending on what is
    installed and available on a given machine.  This article
    discusses the current development state of <em><code>anygui</code></em>, and the
    goals of the project.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction: Write Once, Display Anywhere!</h3>
 <p>
  One of the great promises of Java, some years back when it was
  new, was the idea that one could "write once, run anywhere."
  At first, the user interface for Java was conceived mostly as
  applets embedded in web browsers.  After a while, independent
  AWT applications became a more current notion.  AWT, in turn,
  was generally superseded by Swing.  Swing became Beans
  (building on Swing, but with additional requirements).  Along
  the way, Swing classes moved around, and were added and
  substracted from Java versions.
</p>
<p>
  A popular joke about Java is that it is "write once, <em>debug</em>
  everywhere."  At the least, one certainly cannot write a Java
  application, and then feel any great confidence that it will
  run on the machine of every user of your application--unless
  you are willing to require considerable work by every user to
  get Java versions and configurations exactly right for your
  particular application.  Whether the application runs depends
  on the Java version, and even on the particular vendor and
  platform of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
</p>
<p>
  In most respects, scripting languages like Python, Perl and TCL
  have better portability than Java does.  For most Python
  scripts, for example, one can feel quite confident that a
  script delivered to multiple users will run correctly and
  identically on each target machine (possibly subject to a
  minimum version requirement--which is much simpler and more
  reliable than with Java).  Of course, Java has many strong
  points besides raw portability:  static typing (for those who
  want it), huge class libraries, excellent documentation,
  careful design choices).  But those language considerations are
  not what I am interested in here.
</p>
<p>
  The one aspect where a Python script falls far short of a Java
  application in terms of portability is in user interface.  For
  a command-line tool, no problem.  But as soon as you want
  complex user interaction--especially explicitly graphical
  interfaces--Python offers practically nothing.  Java, for all
  its glitches and gotchas, really does usually provide Swing and
  AWT basics for every platform with a JVM.  Python, to the
  contrary, simply does not have any "standard" GUI library.
</p>
<p>
  Many people have stated their desire for a standard Python GUI.
  <em><code>Tkinter</code></em> comes moderately close--it has stable versions for
  Windows and Unix/X Window Sytem, and a passable MacOS version.
  But you also need TCL and TK installed on the system, and
  "minor" platforms like BeOS and OS/2 are left out.  Various
  advocates have suggested that some other library/binding would
  be a better choice (there are many to choose from , see
  Resources).  But each one supports a the subset of desired
  platforms; and most importantly, none has been uniformly
  accepted (and therefore, none comes standard with Python
  distributions).  What one is left with is no way of writing an
  application with a user interface, and being sure that actual
  <em>users</em> can interface with it.
</p>
<h3>Rethinking The Problem</h3>
 <p>
  The Java philosophy has been to create a standard set of
  capabilities that every JVM must implement.  The Java GUI
  exists by decree.  A Pythonic approach might come from a
  different direction.  Instead of commanding every machine to
  obey a certain API, figure out just what a given machine <em>can</em>
  do, then work from there.  An API can emerge merely as a
  wrapper for what underlying platforms already do.
</p>
<p>
  <em><code>aygui</code></em> does exactly what one would expect once one arrives at
  the Python way of thinking.  Taking both its name and attitude
  from the <em><code>anydbm</code></em> module which finds the "best available"
  database backend at runtime, <em><code>anygui</code></em> finds the best available
  GUI backend on the sytem an <em><code>anygui</code></em> application is running on.
  The emphasis of <em><code>anygui</code></em> is to provide a <em>usable</em> set of
  interface elements that will work with every backend;
  particular backends might themselves be capable of more
  advanced interfaces, but <em><code>anygui</code></em> sticks to what is common to
  them all.
</p>
<p>
  As of this writing, <em><code>anygui</code></em> is still an alpha-level project.
  For a subset of targetted backends, <em><code>anygui</code></em> does a pretty good
  job already.  But since the goal is to be a (near-)universal
  wrapper, having a subset working is obviously not enough.
  Ultimately, if <em><code>anygui</code></em> succeeds in its goals, it will make
  sense to include <em><code>anygui</code></em> as a standard Python package with
  every Python distribution (much as <em><code>anydbm</code></em> or <em><code>xml.sax</code></em> are
  with included despite system-dependent backends).  The point,
  after all, would be to make sure that every user already has
  it.  By the way, <em><code>anygui</code></em> is pure Python; nothing in C/C++ or
  other lower-level languages is requires by <em><code>anygui</code></em> itself (of
  course, if it is to be useful, <em><code>anygui</code></em> should find some
  supporting GUI library).
</p>
<h3>Platforms And Pictures</h3>
 <p>
  For this column installment, I have taken a quick look at most
  of the working backends.  There are a few more that are not yet
  implemented, or are only partially functional.  In the working
  list are <em><code>Tkinter</code></em>, Java Swing, <em><code>win32all</code></em>, <em><code>PyGTK</code></em>, and
  <em><code>wxPython</code></em>.  BeOS native (with Bethon) is only slightly
  working, but that might improve with a new daily build.  PyQT
  and MacOS native are planned, and have development leads, but
  no implementations of these wrappers have been created yet; of
  course, this could also change any time.  There also has been
  some discussion of a direct <code>xlib</code> backend, but no one has
  currently volunteered to lead that one.
</p>
<p>
  All the above graphical toolkits work, or will work, in a
  fairly similar manner.  I confess that my knowledge of most of
  the backend toolkits is weak--but from what I can see, the
  <em><code>anygui</code></em> API is largely similar to <em><code>Tkinter</code></em>.  Essentially, the
  strategy is to create a bunch of widgets with callbacks, then
  enter a main event loop.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few other backends that might exist in the future
  that break with the mold of the "normal" GUI toolkits.  In some
  ways, these seem the most interesting, or at least novel.  One
  planned backend is supposed to be led by your writer--but he
  has been remiss in developing initial versions.  Hopefully
  matters will be better by the time you read this.  My own
  little niche backend is <code>ncurses</code>.  If this is present, it
  opens the possibility of running an <em><code>anygui</code></em> application even
  on a text-mode terminal such as a SSH/telnet session (or just
  plain Unix boxes without the X Window System).
</p>
<p>
  Along the lines of a <em><code>curses</code></em> backend, <em><code>anygui</code></em>'s project lead,
  Magnus Lie Hetland, has suggested a plain line-oriented
  fallback interface, maybe using <code>readlines</code> support.  Under
  this scenario, menus would be reduced to prompts, followed by
  option selection, followed by feedback or results, and so on.
  The hypothetical <em><code>anygui.backends.textgui</code></em> would need nothing
  except STDIN and STDOUT to work, which is an interesting
  minimum for a program that might otherwise run--unchanged--in a
  sophisticated graphical, event-driven, WIMP interface (windows,
  icons, mouse pointer).  Of course, so far it is just an idea.
</p>
<p>
  One more oddball idea is equally interesting.  Everyone has a
  web browser (almost), even if that browser happens to be <code>lynx</code>
  or <code>links</code>.  Python's standard <em><code>webbrowser</code></em> module allows a
  flexible launch of a "best available" web browser, in a manner
  similar to <em><code>anygui</code></em> and its cousins.  If that browser
  communicates with some sort of LOCALHOST server, all the basic
  interface devices one would want are available right in the web
  browser (buttons, input fields, text areas, graphics, etc).
  This backend is also in the planning stage.
</p>
<p>
  A picture is worth a thousand words (at least sometimes).
  Since my editors, with good reason, do not want to publish a
  ten thousand word tome for this installment, let us take a look
  at a few screenshots instead.  For illustration, a little toy
  application that plays with buttons, and enabling inactive ones
  is used (and its source is shown below).  A couple text labels
  are also included.  Other widget examples are contained in the
  <code>test</code> directory of the <em><code>anygui</code></em> distribution.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing worth looking at is what we might think of as
  the "default default" backend, <em><code>Tkinter</code></em>.  This version looks
  and acts pretty much as it should.  However, the
  <code>win.destroy()</code> call is a bit funny--it doesn't immediately
  destroy the window (and close the application), but rather
  turns it into a ghost that disappears once it gets too much
  attention (like moving the window).  Like I said, we are in
  alpha stages.  The example was run under Win98:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/lyric_tk.gif" alt="Button application under Tkinter (on Win98)">
</blockquote>
<p>
  Running under Windows, one also has an option of using Windows
  native calls with the <em><code>win32all</code></em> module.  The ActivePython
  distribution, from ActiveState, has this by default; otherwise
  you need to obtain the module separately (also from
  ActiveState).  Overall, this binding was the best behaved one I
  looked at--but that just reflects the version I tested on.
  Labels are placed a little differently than on <em><code>Tkinter</code></em>, which
  indicates that one might not get precisely the same visual
  aesthetics between backends:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/lyric_msw.gif" alt="Button application under Win32 (on Win98)">
</blockquote>
<p>
  Next, I decided to move to a very different platform.  Running
  Jython under OS/2 Warp 4, I got the below result.  For some
  reason text labels got a gratuitous <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> prepended to them.
  But other than a fairly minor glitch, it starts to be
  impressive to run identical code on a platform so different:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/lyric_java.gif" alt="Button application under Java Swing (on OS/2 Warp 4)">
</blockquote>
<p>
  Moving next to a Linux platform, I ran my identical application
  on a system to <em><code>PyGTK</code></em> installed.  Just for fun, I ran it under
  several different window managers.  First Enlightenment:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/lyric_gtk_e.gif" alt="Button application under GTK (on Enlightenment)">
</blockquote>
<p>
  Then WindowMaker:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/lyric_gtk_wm.gif" alt="Button application under GTK (on WindowMaker)">
</blockquote>
<p>
  Everything inside the window frame is the same with different
  window managers.  Label justification and sizing was a bit
  different from under Windows (a few extra pixels would be
  needed to avoid cutting off words).  I wasn't easily able to
  install <em><code>wxPython</code></em> on any of my systems, but the results should
  be similar.
</p>
<p>
  The BeOS backend is in a more crude state right now.  Even my
  toy application fails.  However, the basic <code>Window</code> class works
  OK:

</blockquote>
<h3>Some Self-same Code</h3>
 <p>
  The code that runs on all the witnessed platforms is quite
  simple.  In my example, the first half of the program is simply
  a switch to allow manual selection of the backend to use from
  the command-line.  In production code, you would not want that;
  but for early testing, something like what I do is helpful.
  Note, however, that all the tests whose screenshots are shown
  were simply run without any command-line options--selection of
  a backend was automatic.  Let us look at the code:

  The skeleton of an application consists of just four steps:
  (1) create an application; (2) create one or more windows; (3)
  add some widgets to the windows; (4) call the <code>app.run()</code>
  event-loop.  Widget options are all passed as named parameters.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  Everything one needs to write basic "get some data, process it,
  and display some results" applications is already in the
  current alpha of <em><code>anygui</code></em>.  The discussion lists contain a lot
  of interesting topics about more nuanced event-handling, view
  models, and so on.  And moreover, the <em><code>anygui</code></em> API is yet to be
  officially documented.  In terms of promise, however, <em><code>anygui</code></em>
  excites me more than any Python library I've seen in a good
  while.  It is almost hard to imagine how convenient it will be
  able to transparently get a sophisticated user interface
  everywhere Python itself runs--all without changing a line of
  code for platform specifics.
