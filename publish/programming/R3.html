    R is rich statistical <em>environment</em>, released as Free Software. It
    includes a programming language, and interactive shell, and
    extensive graphing capability. This article follows up David's two
    prior installments (those written with Brad Huntting) and looks at
    the object-orientation in R, along with some additional general
    programming concepts in R.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  The first two installments of this series looked at R in fairly "real
  world" usage; we explored various statistical analyses and graphing
  capabilities around a large series of temperature data that the
  coauthor of those installments had collected. As mentioned in those
  prior articles, what we actually explored barely scratched the surface
  of the deep and rich statistical libraries in R.
</p>
<p>
  For this installment, I want to leave aside consideration of further
  statistical analysis <em>per se</em>. In large part, I do not personally have
  the requisite knowledge of statistics to decide the most
  relevant techniques; both my earlier coauthor, Brad Huntting, and many
  readers know far more in these areas.  But even more significant is
  that I would like to provide readers with some pointers to the
  underlying language facilities of R.  The prior installments made some
  gestures towards the functional programming orientation of R; my hunch
  is that many readers will be more familiar with imperative and object
  oriented languages.  As well, we have previously only looked at using
  R in a rather <em>ad hoc</em> fashion.  For this installment, I want to
  discuss creating reusable and modular components for R development.
</p>
<h3>Back To Basics</h3>
 <p>
  Before getting to R's notion of object orientation let me review and
  clarify a bit about R's data and functions. The main thing to keep in
  mind about R data is that, to a first brush, "everything is a vector."
  Even objects that look superficially distinct from vectors--matrices,
  arrays, data.frames, etc.--are really just vectors with extra
  (mutable) attributes that tell R to treat them in special ways.
</p>
<p>
  The most important attribute that (some) R vectors have is its
  dimension, spelled <code>dim</code>.  The functions, <code>matrix()</code>, <code>array()</code> and
  <code>dim()</code> are simply convenience functions for setting the dimensions of
  a vector.  R's OOP system similarly boils down to what (if anything)
  is in an objects <code>class</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>
  Let us review dimensioning:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Creating vectors and assigning dimensions</h4><pre>
&gt; v = 1:1000
&gt; typeof(v)
[1] "integer"
&gt; attributes(v)
NULL
&gt; dim(v) = c(10,10,10)  # (Re)dimension
&gt; attributes(v)
$dim
[1] 10 10 10
&gt; v2 = matrix(1:1000, nrow=100, ncol=10)
&gt; typeof(v2)
[1] "integer"
&gt; attributes(v2)
$dim
[1] 100  10
&gt; attr(v2,'dim') = c(10,10,10)  # Redimension
&gt; attributes(v2)
$dim
[1] 10 10 10

</pre></div><p>
  In short, their are several syntax conveniences for attaching a <code>dim</code>
  attribute to a vector, but at heart that is all the syntax sugar does.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that can be confusing about R's "everything is a vector"
  approach is that row-wise and column-wise operations may not follow
  your first intuition.  For example, it's simple enough to create a 2-D
  array (a matrix), and even to operate on a single column or row:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Operating on matrix vector, and row-wise</h4><pre>
&gt; m = matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
&gt; m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
&gt; sum(m)  # sum of all elements of m
[1] 78
&gt; sum(m[1,])  # sum of first row
[1] 22

</pre></div><p>
  But if you wanted to create a vector to sum each row, you might be
  inclined to try:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Wrong way to perform multiple row-wise operations</h4><pre>
&gt; sum(m[c(1,2,3),])  # NOT sum of each row
[1] 78

</pre></div><p>
  You <em>could</em> construct a loop here, but that feels at odds with R's
  functional and vector oriented operations.  Instead, the trick is to
  use the function <code>apply()</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>apply() function for row-wise operations</h4><pre>
&gt; apply(m, 1, sum) # by row
[1] 22 26 30
&gt; apply(m, 2, sum) # by column
[1]  6 15 24 33
&gt; apply(m, c(1,2), sum) # by column AND row (sum of each single cell)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
# Kinda worthless to sum each single cell, but what about this:
&gt; a = array(1:24,c(3,4,2))
&gt; apply(a, c(1,2), sum)  # sum by depth in 3-D array
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]   14   20   26   32
[2,]   16   22   28   34
[3,]   18   24   30   36
&gt; apply(a, c(3), sum)    # sum of each depth slice
[1]  78 222

</pre></div><h3>An Infinite Sequence
</h3>
 <p>
  A construct that is sometimes useful to have, for perfectly practical
  reasons, is an infinite sequence of numbers. For example, the coauthor
  of the prior installments was doing some analysis of Monte Carlo
  integration techniques, and for his purposes, it was useful to have an
  infinitely long sequence of random numbers. Understand here that the
  infinite sequence that is needed is <em>not</em> simply the ability to
  generate a new number as needed; it is also necessary to be able to
  refer back to a specific previously referenced element, and have it
  refer to the same value it had before.
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, no computer language and no computer, can store an infinite
  sequence--what they can do is store a <em>lazy</em> and <em>unbounded</em> sequence.
  More elements can be added to a realized list, when and only when,
  access is required. In Python, for example, you might accomplish this
  by creating a list-like object with a custom <code>.__getitem__()</code> method
  that extends the internal list as needed. In Haskell, laziness is
  built deeply into the language--in effect, everything is lazy. In my
  Haskell tutorial (see Resources) I used the example of creating a list
  of <em>all</em> the prime numbers:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Haskell list of ALL primes w/ Sieve of Eratosthenes</h4><pre>
primes :: [Int]
primes = sieve [2 .. ]
sieve (x:xs) = x : sieve [y | y &lt;- xs, (y `rem` x)/=0]

</pre></div><p>
  In respect to the infinite, R is closer to Python than it is to
  Haskell.  You need to explicitly construct more list elements
  as needed.  We need to wait for the OOP section to let vector
  indexing itself launch the behind-the-scenes mechanism; but
  there is still not much scaffolding involved.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Define a vector and a means to dynamically expand it</h4><pre>
inf_vector = rnorm(10, 0, 1)   # arbritrarily start w/ init 10 items
assure &lt;- function(index) {
  extend_by = max(index-length(inf_vector), 0)
  extras = rnorm(extend_by, 0, 1)
  v &lt;- c(inf_vector, extras)
  assign("inf_vector", v, env=.GlobalEnv)
  return(index)
}
getRand &lt;- function(index) {
  assure(index)
  return(inf_vector[index])
}

</pre></div><p>
  Probably the preferred usage is to access values through the
  <code>getRand()</code> wrapper function. Notice that you are perfectly free to
  use slices or computed values, as well as single indices:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using wrapper func as proxy to infinite virtual vector</h4><pre>
&gt; getRand(3)                # Single index
[1] 0.5557101
&gt; getRand(1:5)              # Range
[1] -0.05472011 -0.30419695  0.55571013  0.91667175 -0.40644081
&gt; getRand(sqrt(c(4,16)))    # Computed index collection
[1] -0.3041970  0.9166717
&gt; getRand(100)              # Force background vector extension
[1] 0.6577079

</pre></div><p>
  If you prefer, you can simply <code>assure()</code> the vector is large enough
  before using elements:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Extending vector (if needed) before access</h4><pre>
&gt; assure(2000)
[1] 2000
&gt; inf_vector[1500]
[1] 1.267652

</pre></div><h3>Object Oriented R</h3>
 <p>
  R is capable of fully general object-oriented programming.  But to
  understand this, you need to step back a bit in your thinking about
  <em>what</em> OOP is.  Users of languages like Java and C++, or even of
  Python, Ruby, or Smalltalk, might have a relatively circumscribed
  picture of object-orientation.  Not wrong, but limited to one model.
</p>
<p>
  R's approach to OOP is based around <em>generic functions</em> rather than
  around class hierarchies. This concept will be familiar to readers who
  have used Lisp's CLOS, or who have read my discussion of multiple
  dispatch using Python (see Resources).  Unfortunately, R's approach is
  still single dispatch, in that respect equivalent to the "traditional"
  languages mentioned above (C++, Java, etc).
</p>
<p>
  I should note--though I will not discuss it in any specificity in this
  article--that recent version of R come with a package called <code>methods</code>
  that define and manipulate so-called "formal methods."  In many ways,
  using these formal methods imposes much of the discipline (and
  limitations) you find in "traditional" OOP languages.  In any case,
  formal OOP in R is built on top of the "informal OOP" that I discuss.
  The <code>methods</code> package is still somewhat tentative, from what I can
  tell; but some moderately tweaked version of it seems certain to
  continue in later R versions.  See Resources for more background.
</p>
<p>
  The thing to keep in mind in understanding OOP <em>sui generis</em> is that
  OOP is not really a matter of inheritance specifically, but of
  <em>dispatch decisions</em> more generally. That is, a call to <code>obj.method()</code>
  in a "traditional" OOP language will look through the <em>method
  resolution order</em> (MRO) of an object to find the <em>first</em> ancestor
  class of <code>obj</code> that has a method <code>.method()</code>. What "first" means is a
  more subtle question than is obvious at first (see Resources for a
  good discussion of the evolving MRO design in Python). R makes the
  same decision, but it turns the idea of inheritance "inside out."
  Rather than have a bunch of <em>classes</em> which may define and override
  various methods in their bodies, R creates a family of generic
  <em>functions</em> that carry a tag describing what type of object they want
  to operate on.
</p>
<h3>Generic Functions
</h3>
 <p>
  As a simple example, let us create a generic function called
  <code>whoami()</code>, and some tagged methods to dispatch to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>#------------- Create a generic method
&gt; whoami &lt;- function(x, ...) UseMethod("whoami")
&gt; whoami.foo &lt;- function(x) print("I am a foo")
&gt; whoami.bar &lt;- function(x) print("I am a bar")
&gt; whoami.default &lt;- function(x) print("I don't know who I am")

</pre></div><p>
  The key here is that <em>every</em> object in R may belong to zero, one, or
  more classes.  Specifically, the MRO of any given object (relative to
  a particular method) is simply the vector of named classes, if any, in
  its <code>class</code> attribute.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Tagging objects with class memberships</h4><pre>
&gt; a = 1:10
&gt; b = 2:20
&gt; whoami(a)                 # No class assigned
[1] "I don't know who I am"
&gt; attr(a,'class') &lt;- 'foo'
&gt; attr(b,'class') &lt;- c('baz','bam','bar')
&gt; whoami(a)
[1] "I am a foo"
&gt; whoami(b)                 # Search MRO for defined method
[1] "I am a bar"
&gt; attr(a,'class') &lt;- 'bar'  # Change the class of 'a'
&gt; whoami(a)
[1] "I am a bar"

</pre></div><p>
  As with traditional inheritance languages, an object need not utilize
  the same class for every method it calls. Traditionally, if <code>Child</code>
  inherits from <code>Mom</code> and <code>Dad</code> an object of type <code>Child</code> might utilize
  <code>.meth1()</code> from <code>Mom</code> and <code>.meth2()</code> from <code>Dad</code>.  You can do this in
  R, naturally, but <code>Mom</code> and <code>Dad</code> are nothing substantial, just names:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Dispatch Resolution Per Method</h4><pre>
&gt; meth1 &lt;- function(x) UseMethod("meth1")
&gt; meth1.Mom &lt;- function(x) print("Mom's meth1")
&gt; meth1.Dad &lt;- function(x) print("Dad's meth1")
&gt; meth2 &lt;- function(x) UseMethod("meth2")
&gt; meth2.Dad &lt;- function(x) print("Dad's meth2")
&gt; attr(a,'class') &lt;- c('Mom','Dad')
&gt; meth1(a)   # Even though meth1.Dad exists, Mom comes first for a
[1] "Mom's meth1"
&gt; meth2(a)
[1] "Dad's meth2"

</pre></div><h3>Including Ancestors
</h3>
 <p>
  It might seem limiting to need to explicitly specify the MRO of an
  object rather than rely on its implicit resolution through inheritance
  syntax.  In point of fact, you can perfectly easily implement
  inheritance-based MROs with a minimal wrapper functions.  The MRO I
  use below is probably not the best one possible (see Simionato's essay
  in Resources), but it shows the idea:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>char0 = character(0)
makeMRO &lt;- function(classes=char0, parents=char0) {
    # Create a method resolution order from an optional
    # explicit list and an optional list of parents
    mro &lt;- c(classes)
    for (name in parents) {
        mro &lt;- c(mro, name)
        ancestors &lt;- attr(get(name),'class')
        mro &lt;- c(mro, ancestors[ancestors != name])
    }
    return(mro)
}
NewInstance &lt;- function(value=0, classes=char0, parents=char0) {
    # Create a new object based on initial value,
    # explicit classes and parents (all optional)
    obj &lt;- value
    attr(obj,'class') &lt;- makeMRO(classes, parents)
    return(obj)
}
MaternalGrandma &lt;- NewInstance()
PaternalGrandma &lt;- NewInstance()
Mom &lt;- NewInstance(classes='Mom', parents='MaternalGrandma')
Dad &lt;- NewInstance(0, classes=c('Dad','Uncle'), 'PaternalGrandma')
Me &lt;- NewInstance(value='Hello World', 'Me', c('Mom','Dad'))

</pre></div><p>
  In action:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An object with an inheritance-generated MRO</h4><pre>
&gt; print(Me)
[1] "Hello World"
attr(,"class")
[1] "Me"              "Mom"             "MaternalGrandma" "Dad"
[5] "Uncle"           "PaternalGrandma"

</pre></div><p>
  If you wish to follow a traditional approach to class/instance
  relationship, you want to include the name of the class you create
  (e.g. <code>Mom</code> in its <code>classes</code> argument). Actually, given that each
  "class" is itself a perfectly good object, the above system is closer
  to prototype-based OOP systems than class-based ones. Then again, the
  whole system is flexible enough to include all variations. You are
  perfectly free to segregate class objects from instance objects if you
  wish--you might distinguish classes with a naming convention (e.g.
  <code>Mom</code> versus <code>mom</code>), by attaching another attribute (e.g. <code>type</code> could
  be <code>class</code> or <code>instance</code>; and utility functions would check that), or
  by other means.
</p>
<h3>Revisiting an Infinite Vector
</h3>
 <p>
  Now that we have some OOP scaffolding to work with, we can actually do
  a better job with the infinite vector that was presented above.  The
  first solution is perfectly workable, but it might be nice to have an
  even more seamless and invisible infinite vector.
</p>
<p>
  Operators in R are just shorthand ways to make function calls, and you
  are just as free to specialize operator behavior on a class basis as
  you are any other function call.  While we are at it, we can fix a few
  other weaknesses in the first system: (1) We would like to be able to
  generate as many distinct infinite vectors as need; (2) We would like
  to be able to configure the random distribution used; (3) We would
  like to have the option of initializing an infinite random vector with
  the values in another vector.  So let us do all that:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Define an indexable infinite random vector</h4><pre>
"[.infinite_random" &lt;- function(v, index) {
    name &lt;- attr(v, 'name')
    rfunc &lt;- attr(v, 'rfunc')
    extend_by = max(index-length(v), 0)
    extras = rfunc(extend_by)
    new &lt;- c(v, extras)
    makeInfiniteRandomVector(name, v=new, rfunc)
    return(new[index])
}
unitnorm &lt;- function(n) return(rnorm(n,0,1))
empty &lt;- vector('numeric', 0)
makeInfiniteRandomVector &lt;- function(name, v=empty, rfunc=unitnorm) {
    # Create an infinite vector
    # optionally extend existing vector, configurable rand func
    attr(v,'class') &lt;- 'infinite_random'
    attr(v,'name') &lt;- name
    attr(v,'rfunc') &lt;- rfunc
    assign(name, v, env=.GlobalEnv)
}
makeInfiniteRandomVector('v')
# makeInfiniteRandomVector('inf_poisson', rfunc=my_poisson)
# Usage is just, e.g.: v[1]; v[10]; v[9:12]; etc.

</pre></div><p>
  Indexing is <em>already</em> defined by R as a generic function, so there is
  no need to call <code>UseMethod()</code> to set it up; you just define as many
  new specializations as you wish.  Likewise, the built-in <code>print()</code>
  function is also generic.  We could specialize that with, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Printing an infinite vector</h4><pre>
print.infinite_random &lt;- function(v) {
    a_few = 5
    len = length(v)
    end_range = (len-a_few)+1
    cat('* Infinite Random Vector *\n')
    cat('[1] ', v[1:a_few], '...\n')
    cat('[')
    cat(end_range)
    cat('] ', v[end_range:len], '...\n')
}

</pre></div><p>
  In action:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Example of printing infinite vector</h4><pre>
&gt; v[1000]
[1] -1.341881
&gt; print(v)
* Infinite Random Vector *
[1]  -0.6247392 1.308057 1.654919 1.691754 -2.251065 ...
[996]  1.027440 0.8376 -0.7066545 -0.7778386 -1.341881 ...

</pre></div><h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  Programming general purpose functions, objects and classes in R
  requires taking a step back from the ways of thinking that traditional
  procedural and object-oriented programmers are used to. The prior two
  installments showed you some examples of <em>ad hoc</em> statistical
  exploration, and did not really need such a rethinking (which is
  fine).  But once you wish to reuse your code, it is worth
  understanding the concepts of generic functions and the "inside
  out" OOP you can write with them (but this inside out form is
  actually more general).  The trick here, in my mind, is to
  think of OOP entirely as a question of "what code gets called,
  and how is the decision made".  Do not get hung up on the
  specific syntax familiar languages, whether C++, Objective C,
  Java, Ruby or Python, use to express that; focus on the concept
  of dispatch itself.
