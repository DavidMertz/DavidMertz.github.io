<blockquote>
    XML is a fairly simple format.  Rather than binary encoding,
    it uses plain Unicode text.  All the structures are declared
    with predicatable-looking tags.  Nonetheless, there are still
    enough rules in the XML grammar that a carefully debugged
    parser is needed to process XML documents; and a particular
    parser imposes a particular programming style.  An
    alternative is to make XML even simpler.  The open-source PYX
    format is a purely line-oriented format for representing XML
    documents that allows for much easier processing of XML
    document contents with common text tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>,
    <code>awk</code>, <code>wc</code> and the usual Unix collection.  Libraries in a
    number of programming languages, as well as command-line
    tools, exist for converting between XML and PYX formats, and
    for working with PYX format.  This article introduces the PYX
    format, and provides multi-language code samples.

<h3>Preface</h3>
 <p>
  Regular readers of this column have almost certainly detected
  my dissatisfaction with the most popular techniques for
  manipulating XML documents.  The articles that have discussed
  my Python <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> modify has largely been in response
  to the complexity of DOM.  My introduction to the Haskell
  <em><code>HaXml</code></em> library was primarily a reaction to a perceived
  obtuseness of XSLT.  Continuing this pattern, I find SAX also
  to be far "heavier" than is necessary for many of the problems
  SAX solves.
</p>
<p>
  The SAX API is, by far, more lightweight than either DOM or
  XSLT--not only in terms of computer resources, but more
  importantly in terms of programmer effort and learning curve.
  Even so, even SAX demands that an XML programmer utilize a
  parser library, and conform to a callback API.  The data inside
  XML documents simply is not complex enough to warrant these
  demands.  In my opinion, there ought to be an easier way to
  handle XML documents; and in particular, one ought to be more
  free to use a variety of familiar tools and techniques when
  manipulating XML.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  The PYX format is a line-oriented representation of XML
  documents that is derived from the SGML ESIS format.  PYX is
  not itself XML, but it is able to represent all the information
  within an XML document in a manner that is easier to handle
  using familiar text processing tools.  Moreover, PYX documents
  can themselves be transformed back into XML as needed.  It is
  worth noting that PYX documents are approximately the same size
  as the corresponding XML versions (sometimes a little larger,
  sometimes a little smaller); so storage and transmission
  considerations do not significantly enter into the
  transformation between XML and PYX.
</p>
<p>
  The PYX format is extremely simple to describe and understand.
  The first character on each line identifies the content-type of
  the line.  Content does not directly span lines, although
  successive lines might contain the same content-type.  In the
  case of tag attributes, the attribute name and value are simply
  separated by a space, without use of extra quotes.  The prefix
  characters are:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>(  start-tag
)  end-tag
A  attribute
-  character data (content)
?  processing instruction

</pre></div><p>
  A few characters are escaped in the PYX format.  Newline
  characters that occur inside character data are always
  indicated on a separate content line, using the <code>\n</code> escape
  code.  Tabs are escaped using the <code>\t</code> sequence, and can occur
  on regular (non-newline) content lines, wherever the
  corresponding tabs occur in the original XML.  Backslashes,
  which are used for escaping are themselves escaped as <code>\\</code>.
  Note that spaces are not escaped, and usually some content
  lines will consist entirely of spaces (which might not be
  visually obvious in a text viewer).  Lines are terminated by
  your platform-specific newline delimter.
</p>
<p>
  The motivation for PYX is the wide usage, convenience, and
  familiarity of line-oriented text processing tools and
  techniques.  The GNU textutils, for example, include tools like
  <code>wc</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>uniq</code>; other familiar text processing
  tools are <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and in a more sophisticated way
  <code>perl</code> and other scripting languages.  These types of tools
  both generally expect newline-delimited records and rely on
  regular expression patterns to identify parts of texts.
  Neither of the expectations is a good match for XML, as it
  happens.
</p>
<h3>Using Pyx</h3>
 <p>
  Let us take a look at PYX in action.  PYX libraries exist for
  several programming languages, but much of the time it is most
  useful simply to use the command line tools <code>xmln</code> and <code>xmlv</code>.
  The first is a non-validating transformation tool, the second
  adds validation against a DTD.  "Under the hood" the <code>expat</code>
  and <code>rxp</code> parsers are compiled into these tools; but a user
  does not need to worry about the APIs for those parsers.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML and PYX versions of a document</h4><pre>
[PYX]# cat test.xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE Spam SYSTEM "spam.dtd" &gt;
&lt;!-- Document Comment --&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="test.css" type="text/css"?&gt;
&lt;Spam flavor="pork" size="8oz"&gt;
  &lt;Eggs&gt;Some text about eggs.&lt;/Eggs&gt;
  &lt;MoreSpam&gt;Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")&lt;/MoreSpam&gt;
&lt;/Spam&gt;

[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml
?xml-stylesheet href="test.css" type="text/css"
(Spam
Aflavor pork
Asize 8oz
-\n
-
(Eggs
-Some text about eggs.
)Eggs
-\n
-
(MoreSpam
-Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")
)MoreSpam
-\n
)Spam

</pre></div><p>
  One should notice that the transformation loses the DOCTYPE
  declaration and the comment in the original XML document.  For
  many purposes, this is not important (parsers often discard
  this information also).  The PYX format, in contrast to the XML
  format, allows one to easily pose a variety of ad hoc questions
  about a document.  For example:  what are all the attribute
  values in the sample document?  Using PYX, we can simply ask:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An ad hoc query using PYX format (attributes)</h4><pre>
[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml | grep "^A" | awk '{print $2}'
pork
8oz

</pre></div><p>
  Getting this answer out of the original XML is a huge
  challenge.  Either one needs to create a whole program that
  calls a parser, and looks for tag attribute dictionaries, or
  one needs to come up with a quite complex regular expression
  that will find the information of interest (left as an exercise
  for readers).  Complicating things is the contents of the
  <code>&lt;MoreSpam&gt;</code> element, which contains something that looks a lot
  like a tag attribute, but is not.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another task that PYX makes simple:  let us try to dump
  the non-empty content lines of an XML document.  One could do
  this with SAX, but doing so would require writing a little
  application with a <code>characters()</code> handler, and empty skeletons
  of several other handlers.  What we might like is something
  similar to <code>lynx -dump</code> applied to HTML files.  A one-liner, in
  other words.  On possibility is:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An ad hoc query using PYX format (contents)</h4><pre>
[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml | grep '^-[^\n ]' | sed s/^-//
Some text about eggs.
Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")

</pre></div><p>
  Sean McGrath's article (see Resources) has additional similar
  examples.
</p>
<h3>Going Back To Xml</h3>
 <p>
  The PYX format is sufficiently simple that just about any
  competent programmer can write a <code>PYX2XML</code> tool in under an
  hour.  Every line tells you exactly what needs to be output,
  whether a tag, PI, or content.
</p>
<p>
  There is only a very slight statefulness to the PYX2XML
  conversion--specifically, when an open tag is encountered, the
  next indefinitely many lines may contain attributes for the
  tag.  After the attributes (if any) our output, a closing angle
  bracket is required.  When the open tag is encountered, the
  conversion utility does not yet know whether attributes exist,
  or how many if so.  Therefore, a "looking-for-attributes" state
  needs to be set to true or false.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, despite the notable simplicity of the PYX2XML
  converstion, the tool <code>pyx2xml.py</code> available at the Pyxie
  website is broken in alarmingly many ways.  It does some
  spacing in the XML that looks odd, but which is well-formed.
  But far worse, there are actual programming errors that will
  crash the short script.  Let me just provide a working
  implementation here for readers:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python script for PYX-to-XML conversion</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> sys, os, xreadlines
unescape = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> s: s.replace(r<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\t'</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\t'</FONT>).replace(r<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\\'</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\\'</FONT>)

      get_attrs = 1

      name,val = line[1:].split(None, 1)
      write(<FONT COLOR=#115511>' %s="%s"'</FONT> % (name, unescape(val)[:-1]))

 <p>
  The Pyxie project page contains a Python module called <em><code>pyxie</code></em>.
  This module contains a number of classes to work with PYX
  encoded documents in tree-based or event-based styles.  If you
  adopt the PYX format for many uses (and if you use Python), it
  might be worth using some of these classes.  But in a way, I
  feel like these classes somewhat miss the point.  The virtue of
  PYX format is its simplicity, and accessibility with
  line-oriented tools.
</p>
<p>
  If one wants an in-memory tree representation of an XML
  document, DOM is already available to do just this.  If
  somewhat less convoluted APIs are desired than those of DOM,
  one can also obtain tree structures using modules such as
  Python's <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, Perl's <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em>, Ruby's <em><code>REXML</code></em>,
  and Java's <em><code>JDOM</code></em>.  <em><code>pyxie</code></em> is similar in purpose, but has no
  real advantage.  Similarly, if fully general event-oriented
  processing of XML documents is desired, one might as well use
  SAX or <em><code>expat</code></em>, <em><code>pyxie</code></em> offers no special advantage here.
</p>
<p>
  There are times when one might want to process PYX documents in
  a way that is somewhat sensitive to the hierarchical structure
  of the data.  At a certain point, one falls back into the same
  complexity one has with SAX or DOM, and the point of PYX is
  lost.  But at an initial level of complexity, the only data
  structure one really needs to treat PYX in a hierarchical
  fashion is a tag stack.  This is a fairly simple data structure
  requirement.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in sequentially processing the above test
  document, one would perform the following stack operations:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>1. Push "Spam"
2. Push "Eggs"
3. Pop ("Eggs")
4. Push "MoreSpam"
5. Pop ("MoreSpam")
6. Pop ("Spam")

</pre></div><p>
  In this simple case, the stack never gets more than two items
  deep, but in general it can get arbitrarily deep.  Knowing when
  to push and when to pop is remarkably simple:  Push when a
  start-tag line is encountered, pop when an end-tag line is
  encountered.  Pop operations do not even need to know the
  end-tag string, since it is always the "last thing" that is
  popped by a stack.  Actually, the PYX format would not lost any
  information by leaving off end-tag strings (but one might lose
  the convenience of self-identifying end-tags that do not
  <em>require</em> stack counts; for example, PYX2XML would be harder to
  write).
</p>
<p>
  At each point in the line-by-line processing of a PYX file, the
  single stack tells one everything there is to know about the
  hierarchical context of the current line.  One can even
  construct an XPATH-style qualifier solely by peaking into the
  stack; potentially certain operations on content or attributes
  might depend upon this context.  This sort of processing goes
  slightly beyond what one can usually do with basic text
  utilities, but it nonetheless remains more ad hoc, flexible,
  and simpler than the full blown APIs of an XML
  parser/interface.
