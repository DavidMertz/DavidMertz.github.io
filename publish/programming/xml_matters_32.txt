A rigorously correct tree-oriented XML model

    In general outline, Elliotte Rusty Harold's [XOM] is -yet another-
    object-oriented XML API, somewhat in the style of DOM. However,
    there are a number of features that set [XOM] apart, and that Harold
    argues are important design elements. Chief among these is a
    rigorous insistence on maintaining invariants in in-memory objects
    so that an [XOM] instance can -always- be serialized to correct XML.
    As well, [XOM] aims at a greater simplicity and regularity than
    other Java XML APIs.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of different general attitudes developers have
  towards the XML APIs they develop. Stream-oriented APIs like SAX,
  libxml, SSAX and expat aim towards parsimony firstly--make it fast,
  make it work in little memory, and make few assumptions about the
  overall document structure.  Moreover, stream-oriented APIs can be
  handled in a very procedural style, which is nice for C programming,
  where objects are not ubiquitous.

  In contrast, tree- or object-oriented APIs generally create an
  in-memory image of an XML document, translated into some sort of
  object-oriented (or at least hierarchical, e.g. SXML) rendition.
  Walking, filtering, and transforming XML proxy objects somehow
  utilizes the native syntax of a programming language.  XSLT can
  also be considered an API of sorts, and its functional/declarative
  model is different from either, but let us skip consideration of XSLT
  for this installment.

  Among the tree-oriented APIs, several divergent design goals come to
  the fore. Libraries like [gnosis.xml.objectify], [ElementTree],
  [REXML], [SXML], [XML::Grove] and [JDOM] pretty much aim at shaping
  XML into the most "native" seeming objects possible for their
  respective programming languages--the goal in each of this is to avoid
  needing to think about the fact your data started out as XML; it is
  just another object to you.

  At the other end of the scale, DOM almost completely eschews any
  concern with the particular programming language DOM methods might be
  invoked in.  While the designers of DOM tended to come from a Java
  background more than others, DOM does not really feel any more
  unnatural in other languages than it is in Java.  On the other hand,
  DOM suffers terribly from the weight of design-by-committee: the
  methods are too numerous, inconsistently named, and have poor
  orthogonality.  Making things still worse, a DOM object is not
  entirely -guaranteed- to be serializable into XML; at some edge cases
  you can create "non-well-formed" DOM objects in memory (requiring
  extra checks and behaviors for serialization).

  The closest analogue of [XOM] is DOM, and to an extent [JDOM]. However
  [XOM] aims to remedy the problems of DOM by starting from a fresh
  design, valuing orthogonality, and centralizing control of the API in
  a single expert (the abovementioned Mr. Harold). [XOM] is basically
  prety Java-focussed, even though a Python implementation also exists
  (but seems to have little benefit over other techniques in Python).
  But the primary goal of [XOM] is not to be "true to Java," but rather
  to be "true to XML." Harold's goal is to capture and enforce the
  precise infoset of XML, in a minimal set of relevant object methods.

  There are two sides to the XML-focused orientation of [XOM]. On the
  one hand, it is impossible to create nodes that violate XML rules--for
  example with disallowed tag names, or with null bytes in the content
  (constraints not checked by most APIs). On the other hand, [XOM]
  provides only methods that operate at the same conceptual level as XML
  itself--for example, serialization is only as XML, CDATA sections are
  not retained as separate nodes, and XML attribute order is ignored.

A FIRST APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a start at getting the feel of [XOM], I decided to write the same
  little application I wrote in [SSAX] for the last installment.  The
  utility 'Outline' takes an XML document as input, and produces a
  summary of it in an outline style, displaying the initial portion of
  the longer text sections for context.  Moreover, namespaces are
  dropped from tag names, and only the local portion is displayed.  This
  utility is not particularly complicated or compelling, but it -does-
  cover the basics of walking trees of children and attributes.

  My test XML document is a highly reduced version of a recent
  developerWorks article.  The document looks like:

      #----------- An XML document with most XML features -------------#
      $ cat example.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <?xml-stylesheet type="text/css"
            href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/dW.css" ?>
      <dw-document xmlns:dw="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/">
        <title>The Twisted Matrix Framework</title>
        <author name="David Mertz, Ph.D.">
          <bio>David thinks it's turtles all the way down...</bio>
        </author>
        <docbody>
          <dw:heading refname="" toc="yes">Introduction</dw:heading>
          <p>
            Sorting through Twisted Matrix is reminiscent of the old story
            about blind men and elephants. Twisted Matrix has many
            capabilities within it, and it takes a bit of a gestalt switch
            to <i>get</i> a good sense of why they are all there.
          </p>
        </docbody>
      </dw-document>

  The output I want from my utility is:

      #------------- An outline display of example.xml ----------------#
      $ java Outline example.xml
      <dw-document>
        <title>
        <author name='David Mertz, Ph.D.'>
          <bio>

            Sorting through Twisted...
            <i>
            | a good sense of why they are ...

  Simple enough, and identical to the [SSAX] utility I presented.

WRITING THE OUTLINE UTILITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The main work of 'Outline.java' is performed by the class
  [nu.xom.Builder].  This class builds an in-memory [XOM] object based
  on an XML source.  One surprise I found is that if you specify a class
  initializer of 'true', [XOM] will insist on validation, even for XML
  documents that do not specify a DTD.  In other words, all such
  documents will throw a 'ValidityException' (but this might be system
  dependend upon installed Java XML parsers).  The best approach is
  probably to omit an initialization flag, and let [XOM] figure out the
  best parser.

      #-------------------- Outline.java utility ----------------------#
      import nu.xom.*;
      import java.io.IOException;

      public class Outline {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          try {
            // Use 'Builder(true)' to require validation
            Builder parser = new Builder();
            Document doc = parser.build(args[0]);
            showElement(doc.getRootElement(), 0);
          }
          catch (ValidityException ex) {
            System.err.println(args[0]+" is invalid.");
          }
          catch (ParseException ex) {
            System.err.println(args[0]+" is not well-formed.");
          }
          catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
            System.err.println(args[0]+" cannot be read");
          }
        }
        private static void showElement(Element element, int level) {
          // Show the tag, along with its attributes
          indent(level, "<"+element.getLocalName());
          for (int i=0; i < element.getAttributeCount(); i++) {
            Attribute attr = element.getAttribute(i);
            System.out.print(" "+attr.getLocalName()+"='"+attr.getValue()+"'");
          }
          System.out.println(">");

          // Now loop through child nodes
          for (int i=0; i < element.getChildCount(); i++) {
            Node node = element.getChild(i);
            if (node instanceof Text) {
              String text = node.getValue();
              if (text.length() > 30) {
                indent(level+1, "|"+text.substring(0,30)+"...\n");
              }
            } else if (node instanceof Element) {
              showElement((Element)node, level+1);
            }
          }
        }
        private static void indent(int level, String string) {
          for (int i=0; i < level; i++) { System.out.print("  "); }
          System.out.print(string);
        }
      }

  The organization here is pretty straightforward. The method
  '.showElement()' displays the name and attributes of each element, then
  recurses to its children, incremementing an indent level on each
  recursion.

  In designing this utility, I took an illustrative misstep.  The class
  'Element' has a method '.getChildElements()' that returns a
  traversable list of elements--excluding other 'Node' objects from the
  enumeration.  On its face, using this enumeration would seem more
  straightforward; the method is, in fact, widely useful since you can
  optionally limit the enumeration to children with a given name.  Since
  an 'Element' also has a '.getValue()' method to retrieve the PCDATA,
  it would seem like we could grab these content strings with each such
  child element.

  Unfortunately, the semantics of '.getValue()' are slightly wrong for
  my intended use: '.getValue()' retrieves -all- the text inside a given
  tag, not only that portion of it leading up to the next child tag. For
  example, in the above example, the blurb inside the '<bio>' element is
  also thereby inside the enclosing '<author>' element, and
  'author.getValue()' retrieves stuff we do not want.  What we are left
  with is walking through all the child nodes, and deciding what to do
  with each based on which subclass of 'Node' we find.  In particular,
  for purposes of this utility, I am only interested in 'Text' and
  'Element', not 'Comment', 'ProcessingInstruction', 'DocType' or
  others.

CREATING A NEW XML DOCUMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While, in my opinion, the main benefit of XML APIs in in parsing and
  traversing existing XML documents, sometimes we also want to create
  new documents within a program--or at least modify existing ones.  For
  the simplest tasks, basic string operations really do suffice.  But
  it's not hard to make a programming error, and fail to close a tag, or
  escape a special value.  Using [XOM] for document creation guards
  against any such errors.

  Here is a brief example, mostly taken from the [XOM] tutorial:

      #---------------------- HelloWorld.java -------------------------#
      import nu.xom.*;
      public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          Element root = new Element("root");
          root.appendChild("Hello World!");
          Attribute foo = new Attribute("foo","bar");
          root.addAttribute(foo);
          Document doc = new Document(root);
          String result = doc.toXML();
          System.out.println(result);
        }
      }

  This outputs the following:

      #---------------------- HelloWorld output -----------------------#
      $ java HelloWorld
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <root foo="bar">Hello World!</root>

  Beyond the basic, '.appendChild()' and '.addAttribute()' methods, the
  '.copy()', '.detach()' method and the '.remove*()' collection are
  useful for rearranging [XOM] trees. Every tree, and every node inside
  it has a '.toXML()' method, and moreover this is the sole
  serialization format for [XOM] objects.

COMPARISONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In writing my little 'Outline' utility, I became curious about how
  convenient [XOM] really is compared to other APIs. Since the same
  utility was written for the last installment on [SSAX], that makes for
  an obvious comparison. As it turns out, the Scheme and Java
  versions--using [SSAX] and [XOM] respectively--work out to pretty much
  the same length in lines, despite Schemes use of macros and dynamic
  typing. The coding style is very different, of course; and the Scheme
  is actually shorter in characters (if you ignore the larger number of
  comments in the [SSAX] version).

  Readers of this column, however, will know that I often advocate
  Python--and specifically my own Gnosis Utilities APIs.  I decided to
  make a quick shot at the same utility using the latest development
  version of [gnosis.xml.objectify]:

      #---------------------- outline.py utility ----------------------#
      from sys import stdin, stdout, stderr
      from gnosis.xml.objectify import XML_Objectify, \
                  make_instance, tagname, content, attributes
      XML_Objectify.expat_kwargs['nspace_sep'] = None

      def showNode(node, level=0):
          stdout.write("  "*level+"<"+tagname(node))
          for key,val in attributes(node).items():
              stdout.write(" %s='%s'" % (key,val))
          stdout.write(">\n")
          for child in content(node):
              if isinstance(child, unicode):
                  if len(child) > 30:
                      stdout.write("  "*(level+1)+"|"+child[:30]+"...\n")
              else:
                  showNode(child, level+1)
      showNode(make_instance(stdin))

  I find it interesting that the Java version with [XOM] is still about
  2.5 times as long (and also very close to the same speed, once I
  benchmarked against a large XML version of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_;
  Python's smaller startup time biases small tests).

  Much of the extra code in Java relates to the various exception
  checking in the method 'Outline.main()'.  In Python, I can let the
  built in exception stacks do the work for me; of course, if I were to
  start doing something more meaningful with exceptions than just report
  them, then Python starts to look more like Java.

  Obviously, however, programmers who want to use Java, for whatever
  good reasons, gain little benefit in knowing that libraries for Python
  or Scheme might allow more compact code.  And Java certainly has a
  number of strengths that can merit the extra verboseness.

CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The real problem with DOM is that it is -good enough- for many
  purposes.  There are far too many methods in DOM, many overlapping in
  purpose, and not named consistently.  Committees and legacies do that.
  Despite that, -everyone- already has a DOM library handy--not just
  Java programmers, but also programmers of many other programming
  languages.  It is too easy to just choose DOM because it is widespread
  and available.

  Even though I would not generally choose to write in Java if I had the
  option to write Python (or maybe Ruby, or even Perl), [XOM] really
  does everything better than DOM.  [XOM] is more correct, easier to
  learn, and more conistent.  Most of its capabilities have not been
  covered in this introduction, but feel assured it has the usual
  collection of XML technologies incorporated: XPath, XSLT, XInclude,
  ability to interface with SAX and DOM, and so on.

  If you are doing XML development in Java, and you are able to include
  a custom LGPL library in your application, I strongly recommend you
  give [XOM] a serious look.
