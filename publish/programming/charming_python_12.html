    In a bit more than a year the Python community has gone from
    having a thin selection of books to recommend to the current
    forest of dead trees available to help with learning and
    programming in Python.  Some books are general introductions
    to the Python language, while others specialize in particular
    tasks.  Even within the general books, level and focus
    differs considerably.  This column gives the David's
    impressions and recommendations on eight of the best known
    books about Python.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  This column should provide readers with a good guide to most of
  the books on Python currently available for purchase.  As of
  this writing, I know of a few books that are available--or are
  expected to be available soon--that I have simply not had the
  opportunity to look at.  By the time you read this, more may
  have been announced and/or published.  It is an exciting time
  to be a Python programmer; in some part because computer book
  publishers are catching on to how "hot" Python is as a
  programming language.  I apologize to any author or publisher
  that has slipped completely by my notice, but I will mention
  the following titles that are not reviewed here, but that
  readers might still want to investigate on their own:
</p>

    * <cite>Core Python Programming</cite>, Wesley J. Chun, Prentice Hall
    (December 2000).

<blockquote>
    * <cite>Python Annotated Archives</cite>, Martin C. Brown, McGraw-Hill
    (December 1999).

    (October 1999).

</blockquote>
<p>
  While books are a wonderful way to get started with most topics
  (including Python), there is also very good documentation that
  accompanies Python itself.  Take a look at:
 <a href="http://python.org/doc/">http://python.org/doc/</a> to get yourself started.  The Python
  team have written a quite excellent introductory tutorial, and
  the quality of the the module index, library reference,
  language reference are much better than most programming
  languages, or free software in general, has (but the
  distinction between the latter two items is always fuzzy to me
  when I go to look something up... try both if in doubt).
</p>
<p>
  One "book" that is not discussed in this column is an
  unfortunate ommission.  <cite>The Standard Python Library</cite> is
  written by Fredrik Lundh, who is truly one of the great
  resources of the Python community (called the "eff-bot" after
  his machinic rigor and his signature "/F").  General sentiment
  is that this is a well-written book; but it is only available
  in "encrypted" electronic form.  Many attempted users have
  complained of many annoyance with the book breaking and/or
  disabling itself when computer hardware/software changes; and
  in the best of cases, the eff-bot book is currently Win32-only.
  Your humble author has had similar problems with other
  Glassbook-format titles.  Overall, this electronic distribution
  approach is just simply not one I can endorse; so I simply
  passed on attempting to dig up a Win32 machine to devote to
  restricted reading of this text.  Mind you, I have nothing
  generally against electronic texts (my column as you are
  probably reading it is an electronic text).  But "copy
  protection" obscurantism is a strong-arm tactic which is
  politically contemptible, grants far less "rights" than do
  printed books, and is fragile waste of users time.  The good
  news is that this same text is due to be published in dead-tree
  form this coming year.
</p>
<h3>Python References For Experienced Programmers</h3>
 <p>
  Programmers who already know Python--or perhaps who do not know
  Python, but know other programming language with similar
  capabilities--will be best served picking up a reference book
  to provide them with gentle reminders of syntax, modules, and
  available functions.  For books of this sort, one rarely wants
  to read cover-to-cover, but a good quality index is essential.
  Information should be grouped logically and compactly.
</p>
<p>
  The <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> is a thin 75 page, small-format
  book.  More than anything, <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> resembles
  a set of 3x5 index cards one might keep to jog your memory on a
  topic (the actual size is slightly larger, but not that much).
  Basically, <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> has lists of everything
  that can helpfully be listed about Python:  command-line
  arguments; environment variables; operators; keywords; syntax
  rules for statements; builtin functions; magic methods; and the
  capabilities of the most important standard modules (and a few
  other things).  It is easy to scan through an appropriate list,
  once you have a general idea about the type of thing you are
  looking for.
</p>
<p>
  Missing from <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> is any index or
  cross-references.  The book is short enough that it is not too
  hard to skim a relevant section, but an explicit index would be
  an improvement (an extra five pages at the end would not push
  it past "pocket sized").  Examples are also rare in <cite>Python
  Pocket Reference</cite>; a function's arguments might be listed, for
  example, but an example or two would be a useful addition in
  many cases.  Overall, I find <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> just a
  bit too thin and summary to be of huge use, especially since I
  generally have the library reference and language reference a
  few keystrokes away at those times I need the sort of answer
  <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite> will provide.
</p>
<p>
  More to my own taste is the excellent <cite>Python Essential
  Reference</cite>.  At 320 pages and with an academic-paperback
  form factor, <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> is a lot easier to
  carry around than any of the other Python books reviewed below.
  But do not expect to fit it in any pockets (maybe an outside
  pocket of a winter-jacket).  As well, the book is set in an 8
  or 9-point typeface (a clean serif face with nice use of fixed,
  sans serif, and demibold contrasts for examples, lists, and so
  on).  This makes for a lot more words packed into a reasonable
  size, but also is likely to make for some squinting and leaning
  over for those programmers with less-than-perfect vision.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> is simply excellent in both
  writing clarity and editorial aids.  The index is extremely
  professional, and points you competently to relevant sections
  (it neither underindexes nor overindexes, both of which are
  pitfalls for computer topics).  I might quibble with the
  typographic choice of serif-bold for the index main items,
  which feels too heavy, but that is a trifle.  In addition, many
  sections contain inline "See also" notes that list page numbers
  and section titles.  This brings the power of hypertext to the
  convenience of a bound volume.
</p>
<p>
  The general topics covered by <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> are
  similar to those in <cite>Python Pocket Reference</cite>, but with more
  detail of coverage, and with more coverage of extension
  modules.  As well, most formal description is accompanied by
  well chosen examples of a function/module/construct in action.
  The remarkable thing Beazley has accomplished is to organize
  related concepts in such a way that you can get a quick sense
  of a given function by reading its subsection, but reading a
  whole section or chapter nonetheless has a natural flow to it.
  <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> has some brief introductory
  material to Python as a language, which might suffice for a
  programmer with experience in several other languages, but for
  someone really getting started, one of the below texts is a
  better choice for a first book (but get Beazley's anyway, to
  refer to later).
</p>
<h3>Gentle Introductions To The Python Language</h3>
 <p>
  The godfather of Python books is Mark Lutz' <cite>Programming
  Python</cite>.  I am not certain whether it was the first book
  published on Python, but for several years it was the standard
  one to refer users to.  <cite>Programming Python</cite> is fairly ambitious
  as a project.  It is one of those 900 page computer references
  one finds in stores, but without the fluff and filler of many
  such tomes.  Lutz's general approach is to introduce readers to
  Python by way of an expanding example program (an archive
  program).  Each introduced Python feature is utilized to add
  new features to the sample program, including things like a
  graphic interface with Tkinter and some basic OOP design
  considerations (some other examples are used along the way, as
  needed).  This is one good approach (not necessarily the only
  one) for fairly novice programmers, but is a little slow for
  experienced ones.
</p>
<p>
  Despite its virtues, it is difficult to really recommend
  <cite>Programming Python</cite> at this point.  Being published in 1996,
  <cite>Programming Python</cite> feels a bit out of date; Python is a
  conservative language, and little you would learn is actually
  inaccurate now, but in the last 4-5 years quite a few new
  moudles have been added, and even a few important new inherent
  language features (especially with Python 2, which is not yet
  in any of the books).  However, if rumors of a new edition
  prove true, this book could get a new life.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Learning Python</cite> is in some ways a successor for <cite>Programming
  Python</cite>. <cite>Learning Python</cite> is also an O'Reilly title, and is
  also (co-authored) by Mark Lutz.  At 365 pages and the same
  9.5" x 7" form factor as most O'Reilly books, <cite>Learning Python</cite>
  is a quicker read than <cite>Programming Python</cite>.  The idea of
  running one example throughout the book has been dropped,
  probably in conjunction with aiming slightly less at completely
  beginning programmers.  But <cite>Learning Python</cite> is still quite
  gentle as an introduction, with every feature explained in
  sufficient detail for, e.g., a (bright) high school student who
  has not previously encountered that programming concept.
</p>
<p>
  In strucuture, <cite>Learning Python</cite> is composed of a series of
  chapters that build on each other in a logical fashion.  Local
  examples and source code are provided along the way as a way to
  see each feature in a (limited) real-world context.  The tone
  is conversational, with liberal use of 2nd person and 1st
  person plural.  The editing, as with all O'Reilly books, is
  careful and consistent.  The final chapters throw in bits and
  pieces of special topics: COM, Tkinter, JPython, etc.  These
  feel a little bit out of place, neither intergrated with the
  main text, nor quite detailed enough to stand on their own.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite> is something like a cross between
  <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> and <cite>Learning Python</cite>.
  Superficially, it is the size of the latter with the typography
  of the former.  The goal of <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite> is to serve
  as an introductory text which simultaneously is usable as a
  reference to go back to.  Topics are organized in subsections,
  each introduced in a tone that is more descriptive than
  <cite>Learning Python</cite>, but more conversational than <cite>Python
  Essential Reference</cite>.  A good range of topics are covered:
  basic language features and standard modules; Tkinter; COM;
  JPython; OS specific usage.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite> aims at a more sophisticated reader
  than <cite>Learning Python</cite> does.  You can learn Python from the
  <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite>, but you should start out with some
  experience in other programming languages.  And the index is
  strong enough that this is a book you can usefully refer back
  to later.  Overall, I would say that if you can only buy one
  Python book, buy <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite>.  That said, if you
  can buy more than one, <cite>Python Essential Reference</cite> is better
  for referring back to, which sort of undermines one of the two
  goals of <cite>The Quick Python Book</cite>.
</p>
<h3>Specialized Programming Tasks In Python</h3>
 <p>
  Sometimes what you want is not a general book on Python, but
  one that goes into greater detail on performing a specific
  task, or working in a specific environment.  Three such titles
  are available (obviously, they are what you want only if they
  cover your particular area of interest).
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Python and Tkinter Programming</cite> cover just what you would
  expect:  working with the <em><code>Tkinter</code></em> wrapper for the <code>TK</code>
  library (available on many OS platforms).  It runs a fairly
  lengthy 650 pages, but much of that is code samples and
  screenshots.  In the context of learning a GUI library, these
  screenshots are helpful in visualizing what a widget really
  does (or a layout, etc).  The code is probably a little longer
  than is really helpful, however.  As various <em><code>Tkinter</code></em> features
  are introduced, complete little applications utilizing them are
  given as code samples.  But it is unlikely you will actually
  use Grayson's specific applications yourself, and seeing ten
  widget of the same type created does not really illustrate much
  more that seeing one created.  That said, Grayson does a good
  job presenting his subject, and a few extra pages of examples
  does not really hurt the book.  The first 2/3 of <cite>Python and
  Tkinter Programming</cite> is narrative in quality, and leads a
  reader through building the examples.  The final 1/3 provides a
  reference for all the possible <em><code>Tkinter</code></em> arguments and methods.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>XML Processing with Python</cite> is a quirky book.  It presents
  quite a bit of general introduction to Python (certainly more
  than the other specialized books), but very little by way of
  introduction to XML.  That is, McGrath's book is useful for XML
  users/programmers approaching Python, but not nearly as much for
  Python programmers approaching XML (the title would suggest the
  opposite to me).  Also, <cite>XML Processing with Python</cite> uses a
  rather large font, plenty of whitespace, and moderately thick
  paper--I suspect it has fallen into a "priced by the pound"
  gimmick of many recent computer-topic books.  The other odd
  thing about <cite>XML Processing in Python</cite> is the degree to which
  it pushes McGrath's <em><code>pyxie</code></em> library as a way to handle XML
  programming.  <em><code>pyxie</code></em> is actually a very nice concept that
  transforms XML into a line-oriented--and more easily parsed and
  processed--format call <code>PYX</code>.  The approach is a good one, but
  probably a lot more programmers will still want to use more
  standard techniques like SAX and DOM.  Fortunately, McGrath
  does provide reasonable introductions to SAX and DOM as well,
  but in the end he really wants you to use <em><code>pyxie</code></em> (which is
  free software, so it is not a commercial plug).
</p>
<p>
  I must confess that I have had less opportunity to evaluate
  <cite>Python Programming on Win32</cite> than I have most of the others.
  I just do not use the Win32 platform enough to have undertaken
  any real projects for which I would need this book.  However,
  the authors certainly have immaculate credentials:  Mark
  Hammond is creator of the PythonWin IDE, PythonCOM, and Python
  for .NET.  He knows Windows, and he has done a lot for the
  Python community.  In tone, <cite>Python Programming for Win32</cite> is
  pretty similar to <cite>Learning Python</cite>.  Both are fairly
  conversational, and lead readers through a logically arranged
  succession of topics.  <cite>Python Programming on Win32</cite> provides a
  pretty quick introduction to Python in general, then moves on
  to working with all the specifics of the Windows platform:
  COM, ODBC, ActiveScripting, and other aspects.  Python makes a
  really nice fit for Windows, actually; all those chores you
  might otherwise do in VB or VBScript--scripting MS-Office
  applications, maintaining the registry and configurations,
  creating ASP pages for IIS, etc.--are simply easier to do if
  you use Python instead.  <cite>Python Programming on Win32</cite> is a
  good introduction to doing this very set of things.
