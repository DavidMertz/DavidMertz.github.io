<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "System Customization and Automation", the seventh of eight
  tutorials designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial
  you will learn some basic approaches to scripting and automating
  system events such as report and status generation, cleanup and
  general upkeep.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About customization and automation
</h3>
 <p>
  One of the task categories a system administrator needs to perform is
  the automation of various things that should occur either
  periodically, or with minimal fuss when a recurrent need arises.  For
  automatic scheduling, your primary tools are <code>cron</code> and <code>at</code>.  Tasks
  themselves, whether regularly scheduled or manually launched can be
  scripted with various languages, including <code>bash</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>perl</code> or
  <code>python</code>.  Tools in the GNU text utilities are very frequently useful
  as part of many processing tasks; these are most often used within
  <code>bash</code> scripts, since more sophisticated languages like <code>awk</code>, <code>perl</code>,
  and <code>python</code> build in most of the capabilities in the text utilities.
</p>
<h3>Scheduling Periodic Tasks</h3>
 <h3>Configuring cron
</h3>
 <p>
  The daemon <code>cron</code> is used to run commands periodically. You can use
  <code>cron</code> for all manner of system housekeeping and administration.
  Anything you want to happen repeatedly on a schedule should be
  controlled by <code>cron</code>. <code>cron</code> has a granularity of one minute--that is,
  it wakes up once a minute to check if it needs to do anything, but
  cannot peform tasks more than once per minute (if you want to do that,
  you probably want a daemon of some sort, not a "cron job"). <code>cron</code> logs
  its action to the syslog facility.
</p>
<p>
  There are several places where <code>cron</code> searches for configuration files
  that indicate environment settings and commands to run.  The first
  place is in <code>/etc/crontab</code>.  These are "system" tasks.  As well, the
  directory <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> may contain multiple configuration files that
  are treated as supplements to <code>/etc/crontab</code>.  Special packages may
  add files (matching package name) to <code>/etc/cron.d/</code>, but system
  administrators should use <code>/etc/crontab</code>.
</p>
<p>
  User-level <code>cron</code> configurations are stored in
  <code>/var/spool/cron/crontabs/$USER</code>.  However, these should always be
  configured using the tool <code>crontab</code>.  Using <code>crontab</code>, users can
  schedule their own recurrent tasks.
</p>
<h3>Daily, weekly and monthly jobs
</h3>
 <p>
  A special convention is used to jobs that should be run daily, weekly
  or monthly, rather than on other more complex schedules.  These are
  probably the most common schedules in practice.  Directories called
  <code>/etc/cron.daily/</code>, <code>/etc/cron.weekly/</code> and <code>/etc/cron.monthly/</code> are
  created with collections of scripts to run on those respective
  schedules.  Adding or removing scripts from these directories is a
  simple way to schedule system tasks.  For example, a system I maintain
  rotates logs daily simply by having a script file:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ cat /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
#!/bin/sh
test -x /usr/sbin/logrotate || exit 0
/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

</pre></div><h3>cron and anacron
</h3>
 <p>
  <code>anacron</code> can be used to execute commands periodically, with a
  frequency specified in days. Unlike <code>cron</code>, <code>anacron</code> checks whether
  each job has been executed in the last N days, where N is the period
  specified for that job (as opposed to whether the current time matches
  the scheduled execution). If not, <code>anacron</code> runs the job’s command,
  after waiting for the number of minutes specified as the delay
  parameter. Hence, on machines that are not running continuously
  periodic jobs will still be executed once the machine is actually
  running (obviously, the exact timing might vary, but the task will not
  be forgotten).
</p>
<p>
  <code>anacron</code> reads a list of jobs from the configuration file
  <code>/etc/anacrontab</code>. Each job entry specifies a period in days, a delay
  in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell command. For example,
  on one Linux system I maintain, <code>anacron</code> is used to run daily, weekly
  and monthly jobs even if the machine is not running at the scheduled
  time of day:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ cat /etc/anacrontab
# /etc/anacrontab: configuration file for anacron
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
# These replace cron's entries
1         5  cron.daily    nice run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
7        10  cron.weekly   nice run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly
@monthly 15  cron.monthly  nice run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly

</pre></div><h3>The contents of a crontab
</h3>
 <p>
  The format of <code>/etc/crontab</code> (or the contents of <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> files)
  is slightly different from user <code>crontab</code> files.  Basically, this just
  amounts to an extra field in <code>/etc/crontab</code> that indicates the user a
  command runs as.  This is not needed for user <code>crontab</code> files since
  they are already stored in a file matching username
  (<code>/var/spool/cron/crontabs/$USER</code>).
</p>
<p>
  Each line of <code>/etc/crontab</code> either sets an environment variable or
  configures a recurring job. Comment and blank lines are ignored. For
  "cron jobs", the first five fields specify times to run, where each
  zero-based field may have a list and/or a range. The fields are
  minute, hour, day-of-month, month, day-of-week (space or tab
  separated). An asterisk in any position indicates "any". For example,
  to run a task at midnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays during August
  through October, you could use:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># line in /etc/crontab
0 0 * 7-9 2,5  root /usr/local/bin/the-task -opt1 -opt2

</pre></div><h3>Special scheduling values
</h3>
 <p>
  Some common scheduling patterns have shortcut names that may be used
  in place of the first five fields:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>@reboot        Run once, at startup.
@yearly        Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
@annually      (same as @yearly)
@monthly       Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
@weekly        Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
@daily         Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
@midnight      (same as @daily)
@hourly        Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".

</pre></div><p>
  For example, you might have a configuration containing:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>@hourly       root /usr/local/bin/hourly-task
0,29 * * * *  root /usr/local/bin/twice-hourly-task

</pre></div><h3>Using crontab
</h3>
 <p>
  To setup a user-level scheduled task, use the <code>crontab</code> command (as
  opposed to the <code>/etc/crontab</code> file.  Specifically, <code>crontab -e</code>
  launches and editor to modify a file.  You can list current jobs with
  <code>crontab -l</code>, and remove the file with <code>crontab -r</code>.  Optionally, you
  can specify <code>crontab -u user</code> to schedule tasks for a given user, but
  the default is to do so for yourself (permission limits apply).
</p>
<p>
  The file <code>/etc/cron.allow</code>, if present, must contain the names of all
  user allowed to schedule jobs.  Alternately, if there is no
  <code>/etc/cron.allow</code> then a user must not be in <code>/etc/cron.deny</code> if they
  are allowed to schedule tasks (if neither file exists, everyone may
  use <code>crontab</code>).
</p>
<h3>Scheduling One-time Tasks</h3>
 <h3>at and friends
</h3>
 <p>
  If you need to run a task in the future rather than immediately, you
  can use the command <code>at</code>.  The command <code>at</code> takes a command either
  from STDIN or from a file (using the <code>-f</code> option), and accepts time
  descriptions in a flexible collection of formats.
</p>
<p>
  A family of commands are used in association with <code>at</code> itself'.  <code>atq</code>
  lists pending tasks.  <code>atrm</code> removes a task fro the pending queue.
  <code>batch</code> works much like <code>at</code> except it only runs jobs if the system
  load is low when the job is requested, otherwise deferring run until a
  low system load exists.
</p>
<h3>Permissions
</h3>
 <p>
  Much like with <code>/etc/cron.allow</code> and <code>/etc/cron.deny</code>, <code>at</code> has
  <code>/etc/at.allow</code> and <code>/etc/at.deny</code> to configure permissions for
  running <code>at</code>. The file <code>/etc/at.allow</code>, if present, must contain the
  names of all user allowed to schedule jobs. Alternately, if there is
  no <code>/etc/at.allow</code> then a user must not be in <code>/etc/at.deny</code> if they
  are allowed to schedule tasks (if neither file exists, everyone may
  use <code>crontab</code>).
</p>
<h3>Time specifications
</h3>
 <p>
  See the manpage on your <code>at</code> version for full details. You can specify
  a particular time as <code>HH:MM</code>, which will happen the next time that
  time occurs (if it is passed today, it means tomorrow). If you use 12
  hour time, you may add <code>AM</code> or <code>PM</code>. You may give a date as <code>MMDDYY</code>
  or <code>MM/DD/YY</code> or <code>DD.MM.YY</code> or <code>month-name day</code>.  You may increment
  from the current time with <code>now + N units</code>, which N is a number and
  units is <code>minutes</code>, <code>hours</code>, <code>days</code> or <code>weeks</code>.  The words <code>today</code> and
  <code>tomorrow</code> have their obvious meaning; as do <code>midnight</code> and <code>noon</code>
  (<code>teatime</code> is 4pm).  Some examples:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% at -f ./foo.sh 10am Jul 31
% echo 'bar -opt' | at 1:30 tomorrow

</pre></div><p>
  The exact definition of the time specification can be found in
  <code>/usr/share/doc/at/timespec</code>.
</p>
<h3>Scripting Tips</h3>
 <h3>Outside resources
</h3>
 <p>
  This relatively short tutorial cannot really touch on the ins-and-outs
  of even one major scripting language. A number of excellent books have
  been written on each of Awk, Perl, Bash, Python. The author, however,
  might particularly recommend his own <cite>Text Processing in Python</cite> as a
  good starting point for scripting in Python. Most scripts you will
  write for system administration are aimed at text manipulation:
  extracting values from logs and configuration files; generating
  reports and summaries; but also cleaning up system cruft and sending
  notifications of tasks performed.
</p>
<p>
  The most common scripts in Linux system administration are written in
  <code>bash</code>.  However, <code>bash</code> itself has relatively few built-in
  capabilities.  Instead, <code>bash</code> makes it particularly easy to utilize
  external tools, both basic file utilities like <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>rm</code>,
  <code>cd</code>, and the like; but especially text tools like those found in the
  GNU text utilities.  A good introduction to these utilities can be
  found in "Using the GNU text utilities"
  (http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/l-dw-linux-gnutex-i.html).
</p>
<h3>Bash tips (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  One particularly helpful setting to include in <code>bash</code> scripts that run
  on a schedule is the <code>set -x</code> switch that echos the commands run to
  STDERR.  This is helpful in debugging scripts if they do not seem to
  have the effects anticipated.  Another useful option during testing is
  <code>set -n</code> that causes a script to look for syntax problems, but not
  actually run.  Obviously, you don't want a <code>-n</code> version scheduled in
  <code>cron</code> or <code>at</code>, but to get it working in the first place, it can help.
</p>
<p>
  A <code>cron</code> job that runs a <code>bash</code> script might start something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>#!/bin/bash
exec 2&gt;/tmp/my_stderr
set -x
# functional commands here

</pre></div><p>
  This redirects STDERR to a file, and outputs the commands run to
  STDERR.  Examining that file later can be useful.
</p>
<p>
  The manpage for <code>bash</code> is quite good, though quite long.  Of
  particular interest are all the options that the builtin <code>set</code> can
  accept.
</p>
<h3>Bash tips (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  One of the common things you do in a system administration script is
  process a collection of files, often with the files of interest
  identified using the <code>find</code> command.  However, a problem can arise
  when filenames contain whitespace, and especially newline characters.
  Much of the looping and processing of filenames you are likely to do
  can be confused by these internal whitespace characters.  For example,
  these two commands are different:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% rm foo bar baz bam
% rm 'foo bar' 'baz bam'

</pre></div><p>
  The first unlinks four files (assuming they exist to start with); the
  second removes just two files, each with an internal space in the
  name.  Filenames with spaces are particularly common among multimedia
  content.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, the GNU version of the <code>find</code> command has a a <code>-print0</code>
  option to NULL terminate each result; and the <code>xargs</code> command has a
  corresponding <code>-0</code> command to treat arguments as NULL separated.
  Putting these together, you might cleanup stray files (that might
  contain whitespace in their names) using:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup some old files
set -x
find /home/dqm \( -name '*.core' -o -name '#*' \) -print0 \
 | xargs -0 rm -f

</pre></div><h3>Perl taint mode
</h3>
 <p>
  Perl has a handy switch <code>-T</code> to enable so-called "taint mode."  In
  this mode, Perl takes a variety of extra security precautions, but
  most especially it limits execution of commands arising from external
  input.  If you use <code>sudo</code> execution, taint mode might be enabled
  automatically, but the safest thing is to start your administration
  scripts with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl –T

</pre></div><p>
  Once you do this, all command line arguments, environment variables,
  locale information (see perllocale), results of certain system calls
  (readdir(), readlink(), the variable of shmread(), the messages
  returned by msgrcv(), the password, gcos and shell fields returned by
  the getpwxxx() calls), and all file input are marked as "tainted".
  Tainted data may not be used directly or indirectly in any command
  that invokes a sub-shell, nor in any command that modifies files,
  directories, or processes, with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>
  It's possible to "untaint" particular external values by (cautiously)
  checking them for expected patterns, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>if ($data =~ /^([-\@\w.]+)$/) {
   $data = $1;                     # $data now untainted
} else {
   die "Bad data in ’$data’";      # log this somewhere
}

</pre></div><h3>Perl CPAN packages
</h3>
 <p>
  One of the handy things about Perl is that it comes with a very
  convenient mechanism for installing extra support packages, called
  "CPAN" (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). RubyGems is similar in
  function. Python, unfortunately, does not yet have as automated of an
  installation mechanism (but comes with more in the default
  installation).  Simpler languages like Bash and Awk do not really have
  many add-ons to install in an analogous sense.
</p>
<p>
  The manpage on the <code>cpan</code> command is a good place to get started.  In
  general, if you have a task to perform for which you think someone
  might have done most of the work already, you can look for candidate
  modules at<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/.">http://www.cpan.org/modules/.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The tool <code>cpan</code> has both an interactive shell and a command-line
  operation.  Once configured (run the interactive shell once to be
  prompted on configuration options), <code>cpan</code> handles dependencies and
  download locations in an automated fashion.  For example, suppose I
  discover that I have a system administration task that involves
  processing configuration files in YAML format.  Installing support for
  YAML is as simple as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cpan -i YAML  # maybe with 'sudo' first

</pre></div><p>
   Once installed your scripts can contain <code>use YAML;</code> at top.
   Similarly for whatever capabilities you need that someone has created
   a package for.
