<blockquote>
    The object orientation and transparent introspective
    capabilities of Python allow you to easily create
    <em>declarative mini-lanaguages</em> for programming tasks.  This
    installment is not so much interested in using Python to
    interpret or translate other specialized languages (although
    that is possible), but rather in ways that Python code itself
    can be helpfully restricted to a set of declarative elements.
    Ideally a developer can use declarative techniques to state
    application requirements in a concise and clear way, while
    letting the "behind-the-scenes" framework do the heavy work.
</blockquote>
<h3>Background On Declarative Styles</h3>
 <p>
  When most programmers think about programming, they imagine
  <em>imperative</em> styles and techniques for writing applications.
  The most popular general purpose programming
  languages--including Python and other object-oriented
  languages--are predominantly imperative in style.  On the other
  hand, there are also many programming languages that are
  <em>declarative</em> in style, including both functional and logic
  languages, and also including both general purpose and
  specialized ones.
</p>
<p>
  Let me list a few languages that fall in various categories.
  Many readers have used many of these tools, without necessarily
  thinking about the categorical differences among them.  Python,
  C, C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, Smalltalk, Fortran, Basic, xBase are
  all straightforwardly imperative programming languages.  Some
  of these are object oriented, but that is simply a matter of
  the organization of code and data, not of the fundamental
  programming style.  In these languages, you <em>command</em> the
  program to carry out a sequence of instructions: <em>put</em> some
  data in a variable; <em>fetch</em> the data back out of the variable;
  <em>loop</em> through a block of instructions <em>until</em> some condition
  is satisfied; do something <em>if</em> something else is true.  One
  nice thing about all these languages is that it is easy to
  think about them within familiar temporal metaphors.  Ordinary
  life consists of doing one thing, making a choice, then doing
  another thing, maybe using some tools along the way.  It is
  easy to imagine the computer that runs a program as a cook, or
  a bricklayer, or an automobile driver.
</p>
<p>
  Languages like Prolog, Mercury, SQL, XSLT, EBNF grammars, and
  indeed configuration files of various formats, all <em>declare</em>
  that something is the case, or that certain constraints apply.
  Mathematics is generally the same way. The functional
  languages--e.g. Haskell, ML, Dylan, Ocaml, Scheme--are similar,
  but with more of an emphasis on stating internal (functional)
  relationships between programming objects (recursion, lists,
  etc.).  Our ordinary life, at least in its narrative quality,
  provides no direct analog for the programming constructs of
  these languages.  For those problems you can naturally
  describe in these languages, however, declarative descriptions
  are far more concise, and <em>far</em> less error prone than are
  imperative solutions.  For example, consider a set of linear
  equations:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Linear equations system sample</h4><pre>
10x + 5y - 7z + 1 = 0
17x + 5y - 10z + 3 = 0
5x - 4y + 3z - 6 = 0

</pre></div><p>
  This is a rather elegant shorthand that names several
  relationships among objects (x, y, and z).  You might come
  across these facts in various ways in real life, but actually
  "solving for x" with pencil-and-paper is a matter of messy
  details, prone to error.  Writing the steps in Python is
  probably even worse from a debugging perspective.
</p>
<p>
  Prolog is a language that comes close to logic or mathematics.
  In it, you simply write statements you know to be true, then
  ask the application to derive consequences for you.  Statements
  are composed in no particular order (as the linear equations
  have no order), and you the programmer/user have no real idea
  what steps are taken to derive results.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>family.pro Prolog sample</h4><pre>
/* Adapted from sample at:
&lt;http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis479/prolog/&gt;
This app can answer questions about sisterhood &amp; love, e.g.:
# Is alice a sister of harry?
?-sisterof( alice, harry )
# Which of alice' sisters love wine?
?-sisterof( X, alice ), love( X, wine)
*/
sisterof( X, Y ) :- parents( X, M, F ),
                    female( X ),
                    parents( Y, M, F ).
parents( edward, victoria, albert ).
parents( harry, victoria, albert ).
parents( alice, victoria, albert ).
female( alice ).
loves( harry, wine ).
loves( alice, wine ).

</pre></div><p>
  Not quite identical, but similar in spirit is an EBNF grammar
  declaration (Extended Backus-Naur Form).  You might write some
  declarations like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>EBNF sample</h4><pre>
word        := alphanums, (wordpunct, alphanums)*, contraction?
alphanums   := [a-zA-Z0-9]+
wordpunct   := [-_]
contraction := "'", ("clock"/"d"/"ll"/"m"/"re"/"s"/"t"/"ve")

</pre></div><p>
  This is a compact way of stating what a word <em>would</em> look like
  if you were to encounter one, without actually giving
  sequential instructions on how to recognize one.  A regular
  expression is similar (and in fact suffices for this particular
  grammar production).
</p>
<p>
  For yet another declarative example, consider a document type
  declaration that describes a dialect of valid XML documents.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An XML document type declaration</h4><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT dissertation (chapter+)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT chapter (title, paragraph+)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT paragraph (#PCDATA | figure)+&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT figure EMPTY&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  As with the other examples, the DTD language does not contain
  any instructions about what to do to recognize or create a
  valid XML document.  It merely describes what one would be like
  if it were to exist.  There is a subjunctive mood to
  declarative languages.
</p>
<h3>Python As Interpreter Versus Python As Environment</h3>
 <p>
  Python libraries can utilize declarative languages in one of
  two, fairly distinct, ways.  Perhaps the more common technique
  is to parse and process non-Python declarative languages as
  data.  An application or a library can read in an external
  source (or a string defined internally, but just as a "blob"),
  then figure out a set of imperative steps to carry out that
  conform in some way with those external declaration.  In
  essence, these types of libraries are "data-driven" systems;
  there is a conceptual and category gap between the declarative
  language and what a Python application does to carry out or
  utilize its declarations.  In fact, quite commonly,
  libraries to process those identical declarations are
  also implemented for other programming languages.
</p>
<p>
  All the examples given above fall under this first technique.
  The libary <em><code>PyLog</code></em> is a Python implementation of a Prolog
  system.  It reads a Prolog data file like the sample, then
  creates Python objects to <em>model</em> the Prolog declarations.  The
  EBNF sample uses the particular variant of <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em>, which
  is a Python library that transforms these declarations into
  state tables that can be used by <em><code>mx.TextTools</code></em>.
  <em><code>mx.TextTools</code></em> is itself an extension library for Python that
  uses an underlying C engine to run code stored in Python data
  structures, but having little to do with Python <em>per se</em>.
  Python is great <em>glue</em> for these tasks, but the languages glued
  together are very different from Python.  Most Prolog
  implementations, furthermore, are written in languages other
  than Python, as are most EBNF parsers.
</p>
<p>
  A DTD is similar to the other examples.  If you use a
  validating parser like <em><code>xmlproc</code></em>, you can utilize a DTD to
  verify the dialect of an XML document.  But the language of a
  DTD is un-Pythonic, and <em><code>xmlproc</code></em> just uses it as data that
  needs to be parsed.  Moroever, XML validating parsers have been
  written in many programming languages.  An XSLT transformation
  is similar again, it is not Python specific, and a module like
  <em><code>ft.4xslt</code></em> just uses Python as glue.
</p>
<p>
  While there is nothing <em>wrong</em> with the above approaches and the
  abovementioned tools (I use them all the time), it might be
  more elegant--and in some ways more expressive--if Python
  itself could be the declarative language.  If nothing else,
  libraries that facilitated this would not require programmers
  to think about two (or more) languages when writing one
  application.  At times it is natural and powerful to lean on
  Python introspective capabilities to implement "native"
  declarations.
</p>
<h3>The Magic Of Introspection</h3>
 <p>
  The parsers <em><code>Spark</code></em> and <em><code>PLY</code></em> let users declare Python values
  <em>in Python</em>, then use some magic to let the Python runtime
  environment act as the configuration of parsing.  For example,
  let us look at the <em><code>PLY</code></em> equivalent of the prior <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em>
  grammar.  <em><code>Spark</code></em> is similar to the example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>PLY sample</h4><pre>
tokens = ('ALPHANUMS','WORDPUNCT','CONTRACTION','WHITSPACE')
t_ALPHANUMS = r"[a-zA-Z0-0]+"
t_WORDPUNCT = r"[-_]"
t_CONTRACTION = r"'(clock|d|ll|m|re|s|t|ve)"
def t_WHITESPACE(t):
    r"\s+"
    t.value = " "
    return t
import lex
lex.lex()
lex.input(sometext)
while 1:
    t = lex.token()
    if not t: break

</pre></div><p>
  I have written about <em><code>PLY</code></em> in my forthcoming book <cite>Text
  Processing in Python</cite>, and have written about <em><code>Spark</code></em> in this
  column.  Without going into details of the libraries, what you
  should notice here is that it is the Python bindings themselves
  that configure the parsing (actually lexing/tokening in this
  example).  The <em><code>PLY</code></em> module just happens to know enough about
  the Python environment it is running in to act on these pattern
  declarations.
</p>
<p>
  Just <em>how</em> <em><code>PLY</code></em> knows what it does involves some pretty fancy
  Python programming.  At a first level, an intermediate
  programmer will realize that she can probe the contents of the
  <code>globals()</code> and <code>locals()</code> dictionaries.  That would be fine if
  the declaration style were slightly different.  For example,
  imagine the code were more like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using imported module namespace</h4><pre>
import basic_lex as _
_.tokens = ('ALPHANUMS','WORDPUNCT','CONTRACTION')
_.ALPHANUMS = r"[a-zA-Z0-0]+"
_.WORDPUNCT = r"[-_]"
_.CONTRACTION = r"'(clock|d|ll|m|re|s|t|ve)"
_.lex()

</pre></div><p>
  This style would not be any less declarative, and the <em><code>basic_lex</code></em>
  module could hypothetically contain something simple like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>basic_lex.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="lex"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> lex</B></FONT></A>():
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> t <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> tokens:
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> t, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'='</FONT>, globals()[t]</PRE></div><p>
  Which would produce:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% python basic_app.py
ALPHANUMS = [a-zA-Z0-0]+
WORDPUNCT = [-_]
CONTRACTION = '(clock|d|ll|m|re|s|t|ve)

</pre></div><p>
  <em><code>PLY</code></em> manages to poke into the namespace of the importing
  module using stack frame information.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>magic_lex.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> sys
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>: <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>raise</B></FONT> RuntimeError
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT> RuntimeError:
    e,b,t = sys.exc_info()
    caller_dict = t.tb_frame.f_back.f_globals
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="lex"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> lex</B></FONT></A>():
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> t <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> caller_dict[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'tokens'</FONT>]:
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> t, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'='</FONT>, caller_dict[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'t_'</FONT>+t]</PRE></div><p>
  This produces the same output given in the <code>basic_app.py</code>
  sample, but with declarations using the prior <code>t_TOKEN</code> style.
</p>
<p>
  There is more magic than this in the actual <em><code>PLY</code></em> module.  We
  saw that the tokens named with the pattern <code>t_TOKEN</code> can
  actually be either strings containing regular expressions, or
  functions that contain both regular expression docstrings along
  with action code.  Some type checking allows polymorphic
  behavior:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>polymorphic_lex</h4><pre>
# ...determine caller_dict using RuntimeError...
from types import *
def lex():
    for t in caller_dict['tokens']:
        t_obj = caller_dict['t_'+t]
        if type(t_obj) is FunctionType:
            print t, '=', t_obj.__doc__
        else:
            print t, '=', t_obj

</pre></div><p>
  Obviously, the actual <em><code>PLY</code></em> module does something more
  interesting with these declared patterns than the toy examples,
  but these demonstrate some techniques involved.
</p>
<h3>The Magic Of Inheritance</h3>
 <p>
  Letting a support library poke around in and manipulate an
  application's namespace can enable an elegant declarative
  style.  But often, using inheritance structures together with
  introspection allows an even greater flexibility.
</p>
<p>
  The module <em><code>gnosis.xml.validity</code></em> is a framework for creating
  classes that map directly to DTD productions.  Any
  <em><code>gnosis.xml.validiy</code></em> class can <em>only</em> be instantiated with
  arguments obeying XML dialect validity constraints.  Actually
  that is not quite true, the module will also infer the proper
  types from simpler arguments when there is only one,
  unambiguous, way of "lifting" the arguments to the correct
  types.
</p>
<p>
  Since I wrote the <em><code>gnosis.xml.validity</code></em> module, I am biased to
  thinking its purpose is itself interesting.  But for this
  article, I just want to look at the declarative style in which
  validity classes are created.  A set of rules/classes matching
  the prior DTD sample consists of:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>gnosis.xml.validity rule declarations</h4><pre>
from gnosis.xml.validity import *
class figure(EMPTY):      pass
class _mixedpara(Or):     _disjoins = (PCDATA, figure)
class paragraph(Some):    _type = _mixedpara
class title(PCDATA):      pass
class _paras(Some):       _type = paragraph
class chapter(Seq):       _order = (title, _paras)
class dissertation(Some): _type = chapter

</pre></div><p>
  You might create instances out of these declarations using:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>ch1 = LiftSeq(chapter, ("1st Title","Validity is important"))
ch2 = LiftSeq(chapter, ("2nd Title","Declaration is fun"))
diss = dissertation([ch1, ch2])
print diss

</pre></div><p>
  Notice how closely the classes match the prior DTD.  The
  mapping is basically one-to-one; except it is necessary to use
  intermediaries for quantification and alternation of nested
  tags (intermediary names are marked by a leading underscore).
</p>
<p>
  Notice also that these classes, while created using standard
  Python syntax, are unusual (and more concise) in having no
  methods or instance data.  Classes are defined solely to
  inherit from some framework, where that framework is narrowed
  by a single class attribute.  For example, a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> is a
  sequence of other tags, namely a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> followed by one or
  more <code>&lt;paragraph&gt;</code> tags.  But all we need to do to assure the
  constrain is obeyed in the instances is <em>declare</em> the <code>chapter</code>
  class in this straightforward manner.
</p>
<p>
  The main "trick" involved in programming parent classes like
  <code>gnosis.xml.validity.Seq</code> is to look at the <code>.__class__</code>
  attribute of an <em>instance</em> during initialization.  The class
  <code>chapter</code> does not have its own initialization, so its parent's
  <code>__init__()</code> method is called.  But the <code>self</code> passed to the
  parent <code>__init__()</code> is an instance of <code>chapter</code>, and it knows
  it.  To illustrate, this is part of the implementation of
  <code>gnosis.xml.validity.Seq</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Class gnosis.xml.validity.Seq</h4><pre>
class Seq(tuple):
    def __init__(self, inittup):
        if not hasattr(self.__class__, '_order'):
            raise NotImplementedError, \
                "Child of Abstract Class Seq must specify order"
        if not isinstance(self._order, tuple):
            raise ValidityError, "Seq must have tuple as order"
        self.validate()
        self._tag = self.__class__.__name__

</pre></div><p>
  Once an application programmer tries to create a <code>chapter</code>
  instance, the instantiation code checks that <code>chapter</code> was
  declared with the required <code>._order</code> class attribute, and that
  this attribute is the needed tuple object. The method
  <code>.validate()</code> peforms some further checks to make sure that the
  objects the instance was initialized with belong to the
  corresponding classes specified in <code>._order</code>.
</p>
<h3>When To Declare</h3>
 <p>
  A declarative programming style is <em>almost always</em> a more
  direct way of stating constraints than is an imperative or
  procedural one.  Of course, not all programming problems are
  about constraints--or at least that is not always a natural
  formulation.  But problems of rule based systems, such as
  grammars and inference systems, are much easier to manage if
  they can be described declaratively.  Imperative verification
  of grammaticality quickly turns into spaghetti code, and is
  difficult to debug.  Statments of patterns and rules can remain
  much simpler.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, at least in Python, the verification or enforcement
  of declared rules will always boil down to procedural checks.
  But the right place for such procedural checks is is
  well-tested library code.  Individual applications should rely
  on the simpler declarative interfaces provided by libraries
  like <em><code>Spark</code></em>, or <em><code>PLY</code></em>, or <em><code>gnosis.xml.validity</code></em>.  Other
  libraries like <em><code>xmlproc</code></em>, <em><code>SimpleParse</code></em>, or <em><code>ft.4xslt</code></em> also
  enable declarative styles, although not declarations <em>in
  Python</em> (which is appropriate for their domains, of course).
