    R is rich statistical <em>environment</em>, released as Free Software. It
    includes a programming language, and interactive shell, and extensive
    graphing capability. This article follows up David and Brad's early
    installment both by exploring the syntax of R further and by
    demonstrating some more advanced statistical tests.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  R is both a strongly functional programming language and a general
  environment for statistical exploration of data sets. As an
  environment, R allows you to create many graphical representations of
  data from a custom command-line. R is available in compiled form for
  many computer platforms: Linux, Windows, Mac OSX and MacOS Classic. R
  is generally stable, fast, and comes with an absolutely amazing range
  of statistical and math functions. Optional packages add even further
  to the huge collection of standard packages and functions.
</p>
<p>
  As with the interactive shells of Python, Ruby, <code>wish</code> for TK/TCL, or
  many Lisp environments, the R shell is a great way to explore
  operations--command recall and editing lets you try variations on
  commands. In contrast to many other programming language interactive
  shells, but in keeping with the data-centric nature of R, the R shell
  will optionally save a complete environment (one per working
  directory). A command history is useful part of this: it can be
  examined or modified in the file <code>.Rhistory</code>.  But the major aspect of
  saving an environment is the working data that is saved, in binary
  form, to <code>.RData</code>.  Incidentally, judicious use of the <code>rm()</code> command
  can stop the saved data environment from growing unboundedly (you can
  also spell it <code>remove()</code>).
</p>
<p>
  This article is a second installment on R.  The first part introduced
  some basics of R's datatypes--starting with vectors, but also
  including multidimensional arrays (2-D arrays are known as
  "matrices"), data frames for "smart" tables, lists for heterogenous
  collections, and so on.  The prior installment also performed some
  basic statistical analysis and graphing on a large data set coauthor
  Brad had on hand: a one year history of temperatures around Brad's
  house, taken at three minute intervals.  Like a lot of data sets in
  the real world, we either know or suspect flaws and anomalies in
  Brad's temperature data--in fact, part of this second installment will
  try to make sense of suspicious qualities of the data.
</p>
<p>
  In general, the current article will do two things. We will continue
  to use the same data set introduced before to: (1) explore the R
  language itself in more detail than the first installment did; (2)
  examine general patterns in the data, and how to find them using R.
</p>
<h3>R As A Programming Language</h3>
 <p>
  The (GPL) R programming language has two parents: the proprietary
  S/S-PLUS programming language, from which it gets most of its syntax;
  and the Scheme programming language, from which it gets many (more
  subtle) semantic aspects. S dates back to 1984 in its earliest
  incarnation, with later versions (inlcuding S-PLUS) adding many
  enhancements. Scheme (as Lisp), of course, dates back to days when the
  hills were young.
</p>
<p>
  The second parent of R is worth emphasizing here. Careful readers
  might have noticed something oddly missing from the first
  installment's examples: flow control! That lacuna will be continued
  into this article as well. In point of fact, R has perfectly good
  commands <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>, all of them pretty much
  just like the same-spelled command in Python do (other languages spell
  the same commands a bit differently). Throw in a <code>repeat</code>, <code>break</code>,
  <code>next</code> and <code>switch</code> for a moderate amount of redundancy.  The
  surprising point is that not only do you not need these flow control
  commands, instead they tend to get in the way of getting your work
  done.
</p>
<h3>Declare What You Mean
</h3>
 <p>
  True to its functional programming heritage, you can do most
  everything you want to do in R using plain declarative statements. Two
  features of R make imperative flow control superfluous, in most cases.
  In the first place, we have already seen that most operations on
  collection object work elementwise. There is no need to manually loop
  through a vector of data to do something to its elements. You can do
  something to all the elements of a vector:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Elementwise operations in R</h4><pre>
&gt; a = 1:10            # Range of numbers 1 through 10
&gt; b = a+5             # Add 5 to each element
&gt; b                   # Show b vector
 [1]  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15

</pre></div><p>
  Or you can operate selectively only on elements with certain indices,
  by using an "index array":
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using index arrays to select elements</h4><pre>
&gt; c = b               # Make a (lazy) copy of b
&gt; pos = c(1,2,3,5,7)  # Change the prime indices
&gt; c[pos] = c[pos]*10  # Reassign to indexed positions
&gt; c                   # Show c vector
 [1]  60  70  80   9 100  11 120  13  14  15

</pre></div><p>
  Or maybe best of all, you can use a syntax much akin to <em>list
  comprehensions</em> in Haskell or Python, and only operate on elements
  that have a desired property:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using predicates to select elements</h4><pre>
&gt; d = c
&gt; d[d %% 2 == 0] = -1 # Reassign -1 to all even elements
&gt; d
 [1] -1 -1 -1  9 -1 11 -1 13 -1 15

</pre></div><p>
  Very astute readers may have noticed that these examples use <code>=</code> where
  most of the last installment used <code>&lt;-</code>.  The equal sign does the same
  thing as the assignment arrow, but may only be used at the top-level
  scope, not also in nested expressions.  If in doubt, the arrow is
  safer.
</p>
<h3>Probing The Temperature Data</h3>
 <p>
  In the first installment we read the approximately 170k readings at
  each of four locations into a data frame using the function
  <code>read.table()</code>.  However, for more convenient access to the individual
  temperature series, we copied the columns of data into vectors named
  for the location they measure: <code>outside</code>, <code>livingroom</code>, etc.  Remember
  also that some of the data points were missing in each sequence:
  sometimes the recording computer was down; sometimes instruments
  failed; not all four thermometers came online on exactly the same day;
  and so on.  In other words, our temperature data is a lot like
  real-life data you are likely to work with.
</p>
<p>
  In our initial exploration of the temperature data sets, we noticed an
  anomaly while plotting histograms. Their appears to be a large spike
  in ouside temperature right near 24 degrees Celcius. Our first guess
  was that this spike represented occasional transpositions of the
  temperature readings, where one of the inside temperatures would be
  recorded in the outside log (and the outside, correspondingly, in one
  of the inside logs).  As a way of exploring R, let us see if we can
  prove or disprove this explanation.
</p>
<h3>Finding Anomalies
</h3>
 <p>
  A first step in exploring anomalous data is just <em>finding</em> it.
  Specifically, a single point anomaly will be marked be a sudden
  fluctuation in temperature on each side of a data point. And even more
  specifically, we will expect both neighbors of an anomalous point to
  be either strongly higher or strongly lower than the candidate point.
  For example, the simple sequence of temperatures (at three minute
  intervals) "20, 16, 13" represent an unusually fast drop in
  temperature, but do not suggest a single point error at the middle
  reading. Of course, we do not <em>a priori</em> preclude the existence of
  other types of errors or oddities that pertain to more than just
  isolated readings.
</p>
<p>
  Our first thoughts for identifying odd readings turned to the complex.
  Maybe we could look for high frequency components in Fourier
  transforms on the sequences. Or maybe we could perform analytic
  derivatives on the temperature vectors (probably second derivative to
  get the inflection). Or still yet, we might try convolutions on the
  temperature vectors. All of these options are built in to R. But after
  letting such lofty thoughts bounce around in our head, we decided to
  settle down to earth.  The simple pattern we are looking for is
  temperature readings that have large scalar differences from their
  neighbors.  In other words, we can use the magic of subtraction.
</p>
<p>
  The trick we will use to find all the differences among neighboring
  data points is to create a data frame whose columns in a given row
  correspond to the prior, current, and following data point.  This lets
  us filter the data frame as a whole, selecting rows of possible
  interest.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Finding single-point oddities in outside temperatures</h4><pre>
&gt; len &lt;- length(outside)    # Shorthand name for scalar length of vector
&gt; i &lt;- 1:(len-2)            # Shorthand vector of data frame rows nums
&gt; # Create a data frame for window of measurements per row
&gt; odf &lt;- data.frame(lst=outside[1:(len-2)],
+                   now=outside[2:(len-1)],
+                   nxt=outside[3:len] )
&gt; # Create vector of local temperature fluctuations, add to data frame
&gt; odf$flux &lt;- (odf[i,"now"]*2) - (odf[i,"lst"] + odf[i,"nxt"])
&gt; odf2 &lt;- odf[!is.na(odf$flux),]  # Exclude "Not Available" readings
&gt; oddities &lt;- odf2[abs(odf2$flux) &gt; 6,] # It's odd if flux is over 6

</pre></div><p>
  So what do we have after our filter? Let us take a look:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Eyeballing "oddities" in outside temperatures</h4><pre>
&gt; oddities
        lst  now  nxt flux
2866   21.3 15.0 14.9 -6.2
79501  -1.5 -6.2 -4.1 -6.8
117050 21.2 24.6 21.6  6.4
117059 20.6 23.4 20.1  6.1
127669 24.1 21.2 24.7 -6.4
127670 21.2 24.7 21.5  6.7

</pre></div><p>
  It turns out we have several readings with a high fluctuation from
  their neighbors.  But most of them do not look like very likely
  candidates for transposed readings.  For example, at time step 79501,
  the temperature <em>6.2</em> is surrounded by two distinctly warmer
  temperatures.  But it seems quite unlikely that <em>any</em> of these was an
  indoor temperature--a particularly chilly breeze is a more plausible
  explanation.
</p>
<p>
  It still looks quite conceivable that we had transpositions around
  time step 117059 or 12670. The middle temperatures are right near that
  indoor 24, and the neighboring readings, while definitely
  non-freezing, are distinctly lower. Maybe we have some springtime
  transpositions.
</p>
<h3>Wrapping Useful Operations in a Function
</h3>
 <p>
  What we would like to know now is whether our small number of
  candidate transpositions show up in the other readings.  If we find a
  "missing" outdoor temperature in one of the indoor sites, it strongly
  supports our hypothesis.  But we do not <em>really</em> want to retype the
  complete set of steps just replacing <code>outside</code> with <code>lab</code> everywhere.
  What we really should have done is parameterize the whole sequence of
  steps in a reusable function:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Parameterizing flux detector as function</h4><pre>
oddities &lt;- function(temps, flux) {
  len &lt;- length(temps)
  i &lt;- 1:(len-2)
  df &lt;- data.frame(lst=temps[1:(len-2)],
                   now=temps[2:(len-1)],
                   nxt=temps[3:len])
  df$flux &lt;- (df[i,"now"]*2) - (df[i,"lst"] + df[i,"nxt"])
  df2 &lt;- df[!is.na(df$flux),]
  oddities &lt;- df2[abs(df2$flux) &gt; flux,]
  return(oddities)
}

</pre></div><p>
  Once we have a function, it is much easier to filter on different data
  sets and fluctuation threshholds.  It turns out that running
  <code>oddities(lab,6)</code> does not produce any time steps that match the
  candidate transpositions on the outside (neither does the same thing
  with <code>livingroom</code> or <code>basement</code>).  But a look at lab temperatures
  produces something of its own surprise:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Huge temperature variations in the lab</h4><pre>
&gt; oddities(lab, 30)
       lst  now  nxt  flux
47063 19.9 -2.6 19.5 -44.6
47268 17.7 -2.6 18.2 -41.1
84847 17.1 -0.1 17.0 -34.3
86282 14.9 -1.0 14.8 -31.7
93307 14.2 -6.4 14.1 -41.1


</pre></div><p>
  These sorts of changes are not what we would expect.  Maybe the best
  explanation is that Brad sometimes opened the lab window in the dead
  of winter.  If so, coauthor David marvels at the efficiency of Brad's
  furnace in restoring full heat within three minutes of airing out a
  room.
</p>
<h3>The Real Explanation
</h3>
 <p>
  Maybe looking the underlying full data for a curious time step will
  clear things up:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Full temperature set near step 47063</h4><pre>
&gt; glarp[47062:47066,]
             timestamp basement  lab livingroom outside
47062 2003-10-31T17:07     21.5 20.3       21.8    -2.8
47063 2003-10-31T17:10     21.3 19.9       21.2    -2.7
47064 2003-10-31T17:13     20.9 -2.6       20.9    -2.6
47065 2003-10-31T17:16     20.8 19.5       20.8    -2.6
47066 2003-10-31T17:19     20.5 19.4       20.7    -2.8

</pre></div><p>
  First thing, we notice that the timesteps returned by the <code>oddities()</code>
  function have an off-by-one error.  Oh yeah, we used an offset to get
  a window for each data frame row.  But the full data itself tends to
  promote the "opening a door" idea--Halloween eve at 5 in the evening
  can be pretty cold in Colorado, in fact it might be right when
  trick-or-treaters show up at Brad's door (and receive candy for three
  minutes).  So maybe this mystery is solved.
</p>
<p>
  Still, what about the mystery that started our exploration? What is
  there such a spike around 24 degrees in outdoor temperatures? Maybe we
  should look at the histogram with some more care.  In particular, we
  can use predicative criteria to index a vector, and narrow our
  histogram to just the temperature range of interest:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Narrowing the temperature histogram</h4><pre>
hist(outside[outside &lt; 26 &amp;amp; outside &gt; 23],
     breaks=90, col="green" border="blue")

</pre></div><p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/outside-23to26-histogram.jpg" alt="Outside histogram for narrow temperature range">
</p>
<p>
  Looking at a close-up of the temperature spike, we see distinct
  troughs right next to the spike.  It looks like if you would smooth
  the few tenths-of-a-degree region right around 24.7 degrees, you would
  almost get the expected occurences.  Which brings us back, most
  likely, to odd rounding behavior within the thermometer instrument.
  Well, probably--we are still not sure.  And even with some smoothing,
  there would still be a slight spike.
</p>
<h3>Intermediate Statistical Analysis</h3>
 <p>
  One of R's strengths is its ability to calculate linear, as well as
  nonlinear regression models. To see a simple example, let us create
  two vectors. <code>x</code> will be sample times in days measured from the
  beginning of the data set, and <code>y</code> will be the corresponding outside
  temperatures.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Creating regression vectors</h4><pre>
&gt; y &lt;- glarp$outside
&gt; x &lt;- 1:length(y)/(24*60/3)

</pre></div><p>
  We can fit a line to this data with
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Fitting a linear regression to series</h4><pre>
&gt; l1 = lm(y ~ x)
&gt; summary(l1)
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Residuals:

F-statistic: 295.4 on 1 and 169489 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16

</pre></div><p>
  The "~" syntax denotes a formula object. This in effect asks R to find
  the coefficients A and B which minimize <code>sum((y[i]-(A*x[i]+B))^2)</code>.
  The best fit is when A is -0.0037324 (very close to flat slope), and B
  is 10.2511014. Note, the residual standard error is 9.236, which is
  about the same size as the standard deviation in y to begin with. This
  tells us that a simple linear function of time is an extremely bad
  model for outside temperature.
</p>
<p>
  A better model might be to use sine and cosine functions with a
  periods of 1 day and 1 year. This we can do by changing the formula to
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Attempting trigometric curve fitting</h4><pre>
&gt; l2 = lm(y ~ +I(sin(2*pi*x/365)) +I(cos(2*pi*x/365))
+             +I(sin(2*pi*x)) +I(cos(2*pi*x)) )

</pre></div><p>
  This formula syntax is a little tricky: Inside the <code>I()</code> calls the
  arithmetic symbols have their usual meanings, so the first <code>I()</code>, for
  example, is means: 2 times pi times x, divided by 365. The "+" signs
  in front of the <code>I()</code> calls indicate not addition, but that the factor
  following the <code>+</code> should be included in the model. The result can, as
  usual, be displayed with the summary() command
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Trigometric regression results</h4><pre>
&gt; summary(l2)
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ +I(sin(2 * pi * x/365)) +I(cos(2 * pi * x/365))
                 +I(sin(2 * pi * x)) +I(cos(2 * pi * x)))

</pre></div><p>
  The residual error is still large (5.377), but we console ourselves in
  the fact that Colorado weather is notoriously unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
  R provides still more tools for time series analysis. For example, we
  can plot the autocorrelation function for the living room temperature
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Autocorrelation on livingroom temperature</h4><pre>
&gt; acf(ts(glarp$livingroom, frequency=(24*60/3)),
+     na.action=na.pass, lag.max=9*(24*60/3))

</pre></div><p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/livingroom-acf.gif" alt="Autocorrelation graph for livingroom">
</p>
<p>
  The embeded <code>ts()</code> function creates a time series object out of the
  vector <code>glarp$livingroom</code>. The sampling frequency is specified in
  samples per day. Not surprisingly the temperature is strongly
  correlated when the shift is an integer number of days. Note also the
  slightly larger peak at 7 days. This is caused by the fact that Brad's
  thermostat sets the temperature differently on weekends, resulting in
  slightly larger correlation with a 7 day window.
