<h3>WHAT IS XML Spy?

</h3> <p>  Icon Information Systems characterizes <cite>XML Spy</cite> as:
</p>
<blockquote>    <em><code>A</code></em> true Integrated Development Environment (IDE), XML Spy
    contains features required for many different aspects of
    XML-related tasks.
</blockquote><p>  <cite>XML Spy</cite> lives up to its billing, and includes capabilities
  for most every ad-hoc and manual XML-related task you might be
  faced with.  You can edit, create and validate XML documents,
  DTD's, Schemas, Stylesheets, and various other filetypes
  (including some specialized XML types, such Mathematical Markup
  and BizTalk Schema <em></em> but links to some of those definitions on
  the internet are inaccurate).
</p>
<p>  In general, <cite>XML Spy</cite> presents a consistent and helpful
  interface for working with these document types, and a number
  of helpful tools that automate development tasks.  The
  interface of <cite>XML Spy</cite> is generally modelled after Microsoft's
  Visual Studio development environment with a similar dockable
  paned interface.  The layout will be familiar to many
  developers; but I personally found the default layout to be too
  busy, and leave too little screen real-estate for your main
  documents (I feel the same about Visual Studio though).
  Fortunately, you have many options in selecting what panes,
  toolbars, etc. are visible in the workspace, and in arranging
  them.
</p>
<p>  What <cite>XML Spy</cite> is <strong>not</strong> is a programmatic system for
  <strong>processing</strong> XML documents and related filetypes.  Basic XSL
  transformations are supported, but do not expect to perform
  generalized data extraction and manipulation with this tool.
  You do not, for example, get any access to DOM methods on XML
  documents.  This limitation is not flaw in <cite>XML Spy</cite>, it is
  just what the <cite>XML Spy</cite> does.  Basically, what you get is a
  very specialized and enhanced text editor; that is, there is
  little <cite>XML Spy</cite> does that you could not do in principle with
  Notepad (with a <strong>whole lot</strong> more work for the latter).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Nice Behaviors</strong></p>
 <p>  When editing an XML document (or other filetype), <cite>XML Spy</cite>
  provides you with two basic views: the Text View (which looks
  basically like any text editor) and the Enhanced Grid View
  (which is a structured schematic representation of the
  document).  There is also a Browser View, which is just an
  external DDE call to Internet Explorer 5.5 or above; you cannot
  edit in the Browser View.
</p>
<p>  In both views, you are presented with onscreen prompts and
  shortcuts for entering valid tags and attributes.  If you are
  usuing a DTD or Schema, there is a lot more help to provide.
  An information window describes the current context (element
  versus attribute, model, occurance rule).  Addition "Entry
  Helper" panes show what subtags, attributes and entities are
  available in a context, and assist you in entering required or
  allowed elements.  These helpers make your work a whole lot
  easier in trying to conform to a DTD (or in developing one).
</p>
<p>  One built-in tool of <cite>XML Spy</cite> that felt like actual magic was
  its automatic DTD/Schema generation.  From a typeless XML
  document, <cite>XML Spy</cite> can do a remarkably good job of inferring
  the underlying DTD (and creating and attaching it).  I found
  that this generation was not perfect--for example it believed I
  was using an enumerated type where there was really just
  CDATA--but the "errors" it makes are no worse than those a
  person would who had only the XML document, and not the
  underlying design rules.  Cleaning up or customizing an
  <cite>XML Spy</cite> generated DTD is a lot quicker than writing one from
  scratch!
</p>
<p>  Another nice interface device is an option in the Enhanced Grid
  View.  Most of the time, subtags are displayed in a
  hierarchical tree fashion.  However, <cite>XML Spy</cite> will
  automatically detect when it thinks some data could better be
  displayed in a Database/Table View of repeating element
  sequences.  You can also manually force one view or another.
  For working with what is basically tabular data to start with,
  using this view makes entering and understanding an XML
  document much easier.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Bothersome Behaviors</strong></p>
 <p>  <cite>XML Spy</cite> will check the well-formedness of an XML document,
  and will validate it against a DTD/Schema if one exists.
  However, the compaint messages produced when these checks fail
  are far less helpful than they could be.  In particular, no
  line numbers are given to identify problems.  In a large XML
  document, finding a problem that is described, but not
  specifically highlighted, can be a <strong>lot</strong> of work.
</p>
<p>  Another "misfeature" in my opinion is <cite>XML Spy</cite> fairly strict
  adherance to a tree model in the Enhanced Grid View.  The
  makers do not seem fully to appreciate the distinction between
  character-level markup and block level markup, and this makes
  it hard to enter and view the former.  For example, if you want
  to mark one word as "&lt;ital&gt;" in a block of text (PCDATA), the
  italicized content is shunted to another cell of the grid from
  its adjacent text.  Formally that is accurate, but as an way of
  editing an XML document, it gets in your way more than it
  assists you.  Using the Table View for the text block improves
  things a little bit, but only a little.  Basically, to really
  work with marked-up character data blocks, you have to switch
  to the Text View--but in that case you could have chosen better
  plain-text editors, which is basically what you have in that
  view.
</p>
<p>  The last--or really the first--trouble I had with <cite>XML Spy</cite> is
  that tutorial in the online help is going to be available "real
  soon now." Not every interface feature of <cite>XML Spy</cite> was
  immediately obvious to me, and I really <strong>wanted</strong> to read the
  tutorial.  But as of the current version, you are stuck with
  either trial-and-error or trying to find help on a specific
  feature (which you probably don't know the name of yet, or
  exactly what it is supposed to do).  The learning curve is not
  bad, but a tutorial would have helped.
