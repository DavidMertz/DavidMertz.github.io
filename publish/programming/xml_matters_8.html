    This column discusses several <em>paradigms</em> for data modelling
    that are used by DBMS's.  The reader is led through some
    advantages and disadvantages of each.  Following an
    introduction to data-modelling concepts, David attempts to
    place XML within the world of data models.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  XML is an extremely versitile data <strong>transport</strong> format; but
  despite some high hopes for it, XML is mediocre to poor as a
  data <strong>storage</strong> and <strong>access</strong> format.  It is not nearly time to
  throw away your (SQL) relational databases which are tuned to
  quickly and reliably query complex data.  So just what is the
  relationship between XML and the relational data model?  And
  more specifically, how can a project that utilizes both--with
  data transitions between the two--be well designed?  This
  column discusses data <strong>models</strong> as they have been abstractly
  theorized by computer scientists, with an eye to figuring out
  just how those models help us in developing specific
  multi-representational data flows.  Future columns will look at
  specific code and tools to aid the transitions; this column
  addresses the design considerations.
</p>
<h3>Data Models</h3>
 <p>
  Let's bracket XML for a few moments, and talk about for a bit
  about abstract data models.  A lot of work goes into the
  details of a good database design, at the level of specific
  project requirements.  We are interested in something more
  general than that--in <em>paradigms</em> of data modelling.
</p>
<p>
  In broad themes, database mangagement systems (DBMSs) have been
  of three types historically:  Hierarchical, Relational, and
  Object Oriented.  At this same level of high generality, the
  three types of DBMSs occurred in the historical order listed.
  Hierarchical database arose in the 1960s, on mainframe data
  processing of the time.  "Network databases" are similar to
  hierarchical ones, but with mutliple parent/child relations
  allowed.  In the 1970s, the rigorous mathematical work of E.F.
  Codd and others created the now upiquitous Relational database
  model.  In the 1980s--largely because of the growing popularity
  of object-oriented programming--Object databases gained a
  measure of popularity, especially to model so-called "rich
  data" such as multimedia formats.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, Relational database management systems (RDMSs)
  continue to be the dominant data storage technique for large
  scale systems.  Hierarchical and Object databases fill niche
  requirements.  However, for many years, many popular DBMSs have
  been hybrid Object-Relational, so some borders between data
  model paradigms are blurred in practice.
</p>
<h3>The Hierarchical Model</h3>
 <p>
  In a Hierarchical database (HDBMS), we begin with a strictly
  defined tree of data nodes.  Each node can contain some
  identifying data, plus a set of subnodes of a specific child
  type.  The number of subnodes can vary between sibling nodes at
  the same level, but the type of all "cousins" is identical.  An
  illustration makes this clear:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/hier.gif" alt="Hypothetical Hierarchical Database Model">
</p>
<p>
  A nice property of Hierarchical databases is that data access
  is utterly predictable in structure, and therefore both
  retrieval and updates can be highly optimized by a DBMS.  For
  example, in the pictured model, we might determine a particular
  book's publisher, in a pseudo query syntax, with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>Programming/C.J.Date/An Introduction to Database Systems/Publisher?

</pre></div><p>
  Any such query will have a precise path to the specified datum,
  which may be quickly determinable in balanced trees and
  byte-offset codings.  Any question about any books publisher
  will have exactly the same (unique) form, just with different
  category, author, etc.  To continue with our hypothetical DBMS,
  we might write a more general procedural query in something
  like this (Python-like) pseudo-code:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>for book in get_children("Programming/C.J.Date"):
    print book.field("Title"), book.field("Publisher")

</pre></div><p>
  At this point, XML programmers will have started to notice that
  our pseudo-query syntax looks a lot like XPATH, and our
  procedural pseudo-code looks a fair amount like DOM.  Let's
  keep that in mind as we go through some more models.
</p>
<h3>The Relational Model</h3>
 <p>
  A Relational database consists a set of tables, where each
  table consists a fixed collection of <em>columns</em> (also called
  <em>fields</em>).  An indefinite number of <em>rows</em> (or <em>records</em>) occur
  within each table.  However, each row must have a unique
  <em>primary key</em>, which is a sort of name for that particular
  bundle of data.  An illustration of this is worthwhile also
  (covering roughtly the same data as the Hierarchical example):
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/relat.gif" alt="Hypothetical Relational Database Model">
</p>
<p>
  As well as having primary keys, tables typically have some
  <em>secondary</em> keys.  These secondary keys correspond with primary
  keys in other tables.  For example, in the picture, the BOOKS
  table has secondary keys "AuthorID" and "PubID".  These, in
  turn, serve as primary keys for the AUTHORS and PUBLISHERS
  tables.  The idea here is that every BOOKS row has a distinct
  ISBN value, each AUTHORS a unique AuthorID, and each PUBLISHERS
  a unique PubID.
</p>
<p>
  As a constaint on the <em>relation</em> between tables we can state,
  for example, that for a row to exist in BOOKS, there must exist
  a row in PUBLISHERS with the PubID we want to use in BOOKS.  If
  one publisher can "have" multiple books in this way, we call
  the relation "one-to-many."  On the other hand, if one author
  can have multiple books, but one book can also have multiple
  authors, we call it "many-to-many."  To round things out, there
  also exist "one-to-one" relations where one primary key must
  match exactly one secondary key.  It is the job of RDBMSs to
  enforce just these types of rules.
</p>
<p>
  In Relational databases, the design of tables can become quite
  elaborate, and involve subtle decisions.  The main concern in
  design is for the proper <em>normalization</em> of tables.  The goal
  in normalization--to condense the first through fifth "form" of
  normalization--is to remove all redundancy in the way data is
  stored.  Each non-key datum should live in just one place, and
  nowhere else.  This goal is accomplished almost automatically in
  Hierarchical databases, but takes work in Relational ones.  For
  example, our picture probably has a normalization problem.  If
  books can have multiple authors, where might we store a second
  author?  The only real option is by creating an extra row in
  BOOKS.  But if we do that, we need repeat an identical PubID,
  Date and Title just to mention a second author.  Not only does
  this require extra storage space, it risks introducing errors
  if the Titles do not quite match up between the rows.  To fix
  this, we would need to rethink our design, and probably create
  some more tables and relations.
</p>
<p>
  Compared to the Hierarchical model, the Relational model is
  quite complicated.  But with the complication comes a huge
  increase in power.  You can ask essentially <em>any</em> question you
  want of an RDBMS, but only the questions designed into the
  system for an HDBMS.  For example, suppose you wondered what
  authors were born later than 1970.  In a HDBMS like that
  illustrated above, the only way to find this out would be an
  extremely costly search of <em>every</em> book leaf node.  With an
  RDBMS you use the staightforward SQL query:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>SELECT AuthorName FROM AUTHORS WHERE AuthorBDay &gt; 1970

</pre></div><p>
  For a more complex question, you have to <em>join</em> multiple
  tables, but normalization allows you to do this in complex
  ways.  For example, the above authors who publish with Random
  House might be queried as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>SELECT AuthorName
FROM AUTHORS a, BOOKS b, PUBLISHERS p
WHERE AuthorBDay &gt; 1970
  AND a.AuthorID = b.AuthorID
  AND b.PubID = p.PubID
  AND p.Publisher = "Random House"

</pre></div><p>
  In the query we state several relations we want to hold.
  Another way to think of this is as a filter on the tables, each
  narrowing the search.  The RDBMS can implement these internally
  however it wants, but we can imagine the following steps (in
  the reverse order of the specified query; but query conditions
  can occur in any order):
</p>
<blockquote>
    - Narrow PUBLISHERS to only "Random House" (PubID 03-4472822);
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    - Only consider BOOKS with matching PubID;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    - Grab the list of AuthorID's from these considered BOOKS
      rows;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    - Of the AUTHORS rows with considered AuthorID's, how many
      have the right AuthorBDay?
</blockquote>
<p>
  The problem with a query like this is that it requires a number
  of steps, some of which can be resource intensive.  Even those
  things that are easy in a HDBMS are likely to be relatively
  hard in an RDBMS.  However, the things that are <em>extremely</em>
  hard in HDBMS (all but a very limited few) are only
  <em>moderately</em> hard in an RDBMS.
</p>
<h3>The Object Database Model</h3>
 <p>
  Object databases in some ways go back to the Hierarchical
  model.  Objects in an ODBMS--much like objects in an OO
  programming language--are bundles of data and behaviors.  In
  this sense, objects are similar to branch nodes of an HDBMS,
  which likewise contain a bundle of child nodes.
</p>
<p>
  There are two unique features of Object databases.  (1) Objects
  can be heterogeneous, and each contain a different collection
  of "owned" data; (2) Objects can contain some inherent
  "intelligence."  Each of these features merit brief
  elaboration.  As with the other models, let us suggest a
  diagram to start with:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/odbms.gif" alt="Hypothetical Object Database Model">
</p>
<p>
  Heterogeneous objects in and ODBMS allow each bundle of data to
  contain just what it needs.  To help with this, imagine our
  database is not simply the library book records that our
  previous models covered, but rather an actual online library
  whose content was delivered out of the database.  Different
  media (sound recordings, etexts, movies, etc) will require
  different descriptive information from each other (as well as
  containing different content bitstreams).  Each object is
  pointed to be a known ObjectID, but within the object we do not
  have a rigidly uniform set of child nodes as in a HDBMS.
</p>
<p>
  Since objects in an ODBMS can contain a variety of attributes
  and data, querying objects is often performed through a set of
  "methods" that objects implement--but each object in a way that
  is appropriate for itself.  In the example given, two such
  methods might be "summarize" and "transport."  A summary of a
  book might be its abstact, while the summary of a movie might
  be a trailer.  Each object has the necessary intelligence to
  know what a relevant way of summarizing itself is.  Another way
  of thing of an object's "intelligence" is in terms of
  "meta-data" that it carries.
</p>
<p>
  The Object Database Management Group (ODMG) has proposed a
  standard query language for ODBMS's called OQL.  See Resources
  for details.
</p>
<h3>So Where Does Xml Fit?</h3>
 <p>
  As readers already familiar with XML will have pieced together,
  XML is something of a hybrid.  XML is probably most similar to
  Object databases in data model inasmuch as it also consists of
  nodes, and nodes can contain heterogeneous data.  On the other
  hand, just how heterogeneous nodes are depends a lot on the
  particular DTDs or Schemas used to define the structure of an
  XML document.  In something like XHTML or DocBook, almost any
  element can appear almost anywhere (this is a slight
  exaggeration, but it points in the right direction).  But in
  DTDs oriented more to data records, an XML document could be as
  rigid as a Hierarchical database.  As a <em>transport</em> XML is rich
  enough to represent either objects or hierarchies fully, given
  only the right DTD/Schema.
</p>
<p>
  What XML is less natural in representing is Relational
  databases.  But we should be precise about what is less natural
  here.  XML is certainly adequate to represent anything that
  comes out of an RDBMS.  Individual tables can be directly
  represented literally, albeit far more verbosely than actual
  RDBMS's do.  For example, we might propose the following DTD to
  represent the BOOKS table in our example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT BOOKS (BOOK*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT BOOK (ISBN,AuthorID,PubID,Date,Title)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT ISBN (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT AuthorID (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT PubID (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT Date (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Schemas could be used for richer typing, but the point is that
  there is almost nothing involved in representing a particular
  RDBMS table as XML.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, any specific join we might perform (as in the above
  SQL examples) can equally easily be represented in XML.  In
  practice, representing a query result is the greatest and most
  common use of XML for RDBMS's.  I particular contact usually
  does not need an entire data set, but rather simply some
  particular filtered and structured part of it.  The "GROUP BY"
  and "SORT" clauses in SQL allow for more structuring than we
  have seen, but their results are similarly well represented by
  XML node hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
  The problem for many XML-everywhere (and XML-only) aspirations
  is that the core of an RDBMS are its <strong>relations</strong>.  In
  particular, the set of constraints that exist between tables,
  and that are enforced by the RDBMS are what make RDBMS's so
  useful and powerful.  While it would surely be possible to
  represent a constraint set in XML for purposes of communicating
  it, XML has no inherent mechanism for enforcing constraints of
  this sort (DTDs and Schemas are constraints of a sort, but in a
  different and more limited way).  Without constraints, you just
  have data, not a data model (to put matters in slight
  caricature).
</p>
<p>
  One sometimes sees the notion bandied of adding RDBMS-type
  constraints back into XML, and building XML into RDBMS's in
  some deep way.  I believe that these are extremely bad ideas
  that arise mostly out of a "buzzword compliance" style of
  thinking.  Major RDBMS vendors have spent many years of effort
  in getting these matters right--and especially to getting them
  right in a way that maximizes performance.  You cannot just
  quickly tack on a set of robust and reliable relational
  constraints to a representation that, really, is closer to a
  different modelling paradigm.  Moreover, the verboseness and
  formatting loseness of XML are at heart quite opposite to the
  strategies RDBMS's use to maximize performance (and to a lesser
  extent, reliability), such as fixed record lengths and compact
  storage formats.  In other words, be excited by XML's promise
  of a universal data transport mechanism, but keep your back-end
  data on DB2 or Oracle (or on Postgres or MySQL for smaller
  scale systems).
