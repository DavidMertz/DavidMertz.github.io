    Although users usually think of Python has a procedural and
    object oriented language, it actually contains everything one
    needs for a completely functional approach to programming.
    This article discusses general concepts of functional
    programming, and illustrates ways of implementing functional
    techniques in Python.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>What Is Functional Programming?</h3>
 <p>
  We better start with the hardest question:  "What is functional
  programming (FP), anyway?"  One approach would be to say that
  FP is what you do when you program in languages like Lisp,
  Scheme, Haskell, ML, OCAML, Clean, Mercury or Erlang (or a few
  others).  That is a safe answer, but not one that clarifies
  very much.  Unfortunately, it is hard to get a consistent
  opinion on just what FP is, even from functional programmers
  themselves.  A story about elephants and blind men seems
  apropos here.  It is also safe to contrast FP with "imperative
  programming" (what one does in languages like C, Pascal, C++,
  Java, Perl, Awk, TCL, and most others, at least for the most
  part).
</p>
<p>
  While the author by all means welcomes the advice of those who
  know better, he would roughly characterize functional
  programming as having at least several of the following
  characteristics.  Languages that get called functional make
  these things easy, and other things either hard or disallowed:
</p>
<blockquote>
    * Functions are first class (objects).  That is, everything
      you can do with "data" can be done with functions
      themselves (such as passing a function to another
      function).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * Use of recursion as a primary control structure.  In some
      languages, no other "loop" construct exists other than
      recursion.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * Focus on LISt Processing (e.g. the name <code>Lisp</code>).  Lists are
      often used with recursion on sub-lists as a substitute for
      loops.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * "Pure" functional languages eschew side-effects.  This
      excludes the almost ubiquitous pattern in imperative
      languages of assigning first one, then another value, to
      the same variable to track program state.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * FP either discourages or outright disallows <em>statements</em>,
      and instead works with the evaluation of expressions (i.e.
      functions plus arguments).  In the pure case, one program
      is one expression (plus supporting definitions).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * FP worries about <em>what</em> is to be computed rather than <em>how</em>
      it is to be computed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * Much FP utilizes "higher order" functions (i.e. functions
      that operate on functions that operate on functions).
</blockquote>
<p>
  Advocates of functional programming argue that all these
  characteristic make for more rapidly developed, shorter, and
  less bug-prone code.  Moreover, high theorists of computer
  science, logic, and math find it a lot easier to prove formal
  properties of functional languages and programs than of
  imperative languages and programs.
</p>
<h3>Inherent Python Functional Capabilities</h3>
 <p>
  Python has had most of the characteristics of FP listed above
  since Python 1.0.  But as with most Python features, they have
  been present in a very mixed language.  Much as with Python's
  OOP features, you can use what you want and ignore the rest
  (until you need it later).  With Python 2.0, a <em>very</em> nice bit
  of "syntactic sugar" was added with <em>list comprehensions</em>.
  While list comprehensions add no entirely new capability, they
  make a lot of the old capabilities look <em>a lot</em> nicer.
</p>
<p>
  The basic elements of FP in Python are the functions <code>map()</code>,
  <code>reduce()</code> and <code>filter()</code>, and the operator <code>lambda</code>.  In
  Python 1.x, the <code>apply()</code> function also comes in handy for
  direct application of one function's list return value to
  another function.  Python 2.0 provides an improved syntax for
  this purpose.  Perhaps surprisingly, these very few functions
  (and the basic operators), are almost sufficient to write any
  Python program; specifically, the flow control statements
  (<code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>assert</code>, <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>finally</code>,
  <code>for</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>def</code>) can all be handled
  in a functional style using exclusively the FP functions and
  operators.  While actually eliminating all flow control
  commands in a program is probably only useful for entering an
  "obfuscated Python" contest (with code that will look a lot
  like Lisp), it is worth understanding how FP expresses flow
  control with functions and recursion.
</p>
<h3>Eliminating Flow Control Statements</h3>
 <p>
  The first thing to think about in our elimination exercise is
  the fact that Python "short circuits" evaluation of boolean
  expressions.  This turns out to provide an expression version
  of <code>if</code>/ <code>elif</code>/ <code>else</code> blocks (assuming each block calls one
  function, which is always possible to arrange).  Here is how:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>"Short-circuit" conditional calls in Python</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Normal statement-based flow control</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> &lt;cond1&gt;:   func1()
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>elif</B></FONT> &lt;cond2&gt;: func2()

&gt;&gt;&gt; (x==1 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'one'</FONT>)) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (x==2 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'two'</FONT>)) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'other'</FONT>))
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'other'</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x==1 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'one'</FONT>)) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (x==2 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'two'</FONT>)) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'other'</FONT>))
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'two'</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  Our expression version of conditional calls might seem to be
  nothing but a parlor trick; however, it is more interesting
  when we notice that the <code>lambda</code> operator must return an
  expression.  Since--as we have shown--expressions can contain
  conditional blocks via short circuiting, a <code>lambda</code> expression
  is fully general in expressing conditional return values.
  Building on our example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Lambda with short-circuiting in Python</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; pr = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> s:s
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> x: (x==1 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"one"</FONT>)) \
...                  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (x==2 <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"two"</FONT>)) \
...                  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> (pr(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"other"</FONT>))
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(1)
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'one'</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(2)
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'two'</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(3)
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'other'</PRE></FONT></div><h3>Functions As First Class Objects</h3>
 <p>
  The above examples have already witnessed the first class
  status of functions in Python, but in a subtle way.  When we
  create a <em>function object</em> with the <code>lambda</code> operation we have
  something entirely general.  As such, we were able to bind our
  objects to the names "pr" and "namenum", in exactly the same
  way we might have bound the number 23 or the string "spam" to
  those names.  But just like we can use the number 23 without
  binding it to any name (i.e. as a function argument), we can
  use the function object we created with <code>lambda</code> without
  binding it to any name.  A function is simply another value we
  might do something with in Python.
</p>
<p>
  The main thing we do with our first class objects, is pass them
  to our FP builtin functions <code>map()</code>, <code>reduce()</code> and <code>filter()</code>.
  Each of these functions accepts a function object as its first
  argument.  <code>map()</code> performs the passed function on each
  corresponding item in the specified list(s), and returns a list
  of results.  <code>reduce()</code> performs the passed function on each
  subsequent item and an internal accumulator of a final result;
  for example, <code>reduce(lambda n,m:n*m, range(1,10))</code> means
  "factorial of 10" (i.e. multiply each item by the product of
  previous multiplications).  <code>filter()</code> uses the passed function
  to "evaluate" each item in a list, and return a winnowed list
  of the items that pass the function test.  We also often pass
  function objects to our own custom functions, but usually those
  amount to combinations of the mentioned builtins.
</p>
<p>
  By combining these three FP builtin functions, a surprising
  range of "flow" operations can be performed (all without
  statements, only expressions).
</p>
<h3>Functional Looping In Python</h3>
 <p>
  Replacing loops is as simple as was replacing conditional
  blocks.  <code>for</code> can be directly translated to <code>map()</code>.  As with
  our conditional execution, we will need to simplify statement
  blocks to single function calls (we are getting close to being
  able to generally):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Functional 'for' looping in Python</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> e <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> lst:  func(e)      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># statement-based loop</FONT>
map(func,lst)               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># map()-based loop</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  By the way, a similar technique is available for a functional
  approach to sequential program flow.  That is, imperative
  programming mostly consists of statements that amount to "do
  this, then do that, then do the other thing."  <code>map()</code> lets us
  do just this:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Functional sequential actions in Python</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># let's create an execution utility function</FONT>
do_it = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> f: f()

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># let f1, f2, f3 (etc) be functions that perform actions</FONT>
map(do_it, [f1,f2,f3])    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># map()-based action sequence</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  In general, the whole of our main program can be a <code>map()</code>
  expression with a list of functions to execute to complete the
  program.  Another handy feature of first class functions is
  that you can put them in a list.
</p>
<p>
  Translating <code>while</code> is slightly more complicated, but is still
  possible directly:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Functional 'while' looping in Python</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># statement-based while loop</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> &lt;cond&gt;:
    &lt;pre-suite&gt;
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> &lt;break_condition&gt;:
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>break</B></FONT>
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
        &lt;suite&gt;

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># FP-style recursive while loop</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="while_block"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> while_block</B></FONT></A>():
    &lt;pre-suite&gt;
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> &lt;break_condition&gt;:
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> 1
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
        &lt;suite&gt;
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> 0

while_FP = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT>: (&lt;cond&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>and</B></FONT> while_block()) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> while_FP()
while_FP()</PRE></div><p>
  Our translation of <code>while</code> still requires a <code>while_block()</code>
  function that may itself contain statements rather than just
  expressions.  But we might be able to apply further
  eliminations to that function (such as short circuiting the
  <code>if/else</code> in the template.  Also, it is hard for &lt;cond&gt; to be
  useful with the usual tests, such as <code>while myvar==7</code>, since
  the loop body (by design) cannot change any variable values
  (well, globals could be modified in <code>while_block()</code>).  One way
  to add a more useful condition is to let <code>while_block()</code> return
  a more interesting value, and compare that return for a
  termination condition.  It is worth looking at a concrete
  example of eliminating statements:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Functional 'echo' loop in Python</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># imperative version of "echo()"</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="echo_IMP"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> echo_IMP</B></FONT></A>():
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> 1:
        x = raw_input(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"IMP -- "</FONT>)
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x == <FONT COLOR=#115511>'quit'</FONT>:
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>break</B></FONT>
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> x
echo_IMP()

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># utility function for "identity with side-effect"</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="monadic_print"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> monadic_print</B></FONT></A>(x):
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> x
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> x

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># FP version of "echo()"</FONT>
echo_FP = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT>: monadic_print(raw_input(<FONT COLOR=#115511>"FP -- "</FONT>))==<FONT COLOR=#115511>'quit'</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>or</B></FONT> echo_FP()
echo_FP()</PRE></div><p>
  What we have accomplished is that we have managed to express a
  little program that involves I/O, looping, and conditional
  statments as a pure expression with recursion (in fact, as a
  function object that can be passed elsewhere if desired).  We
  <em>do</em> still utilize the utility function <code>monadic_print()</code>, but
  this function is completely general, and can be reused in every
  functional program expression we might create later (it's a
  one-time cost).  Notice that any expression containing
  <code>monadic_print(x)</code> <em>evaluates</em> to the same thing as if it had
  simply contained <code>x</code>.  FP (particularly Haskell) has the notion
  of a "monad" for a function that "does nothing, and has a side
  effect in the process."
</p>
<h3>Eliminating Side-effects</h3>
 <p>
  After all this work in getting rid of perfectly sensible
  statements and substituting obscure nested expressions for
  them, a naturaly question is "Why?!"  Reading over my
  descriptions of FP, we can see that all of them are achieved in
  Python.  But the most important characteristic--and the one
  likely to be concretely useful--is the elimination of
  side-effects (or at least their containment to special areas
  like monads).  A very large percentage of program errors--and
  the problem that drives programmers to debuggers--occur because
  variables obtain unexpected values during the course of program
  execution.  Functional programs bypasses this particular issue
  by simply not assigning values to variables at all.
</p>
<p>
  Let's look at a fairly ordinary bit of imperative code.  The
  goal here is to print out a list of pairs of numbers whose
  product is more than 25.  The numbers that make up the pairs
  are themselves taken from two other lists.  This sort of thing
  is moderately similar to things that programmers actually do in
  segments of their programs.  An imperative approach to the goal
  might look like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Imperative Python code for "print big products"</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Nested loop procedural style for finding big products</FONT>
xs = (1,2,3,4)
ys = (10,15,3,22)
bigmuls = []
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># ...more stuff...</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> x <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> xs:
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> y <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> ys:
        <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># ...more stuff...</FONT>
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x*y &gt; 25:
            bigmuls.append((x,y))
            <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># ...more stuff...</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># ...more stuff...</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> bigmuls</PRE></div><p>
  This project is small enough that nothing is likely to go
  wrong.  But perhaps our goal is embedded in code that
  accomplishes a number of other goals at the same time.  The
  sections commented with "more stuff" are the places where
  side-effects are likely to lead to bugs.  At any of these
  points, the variables <code>xs</code>, <code>ys</code>, <code>bigmuls</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> might
  acquire unexpected values in the hypothetical abbreviated code.
  Futhermore, after this bit of code is done, all the variables
  have values that may or may not be expected and wanted by later
  code.  Obviously, encapsulation in functions/instances and care
  as to scoping can be used to guard against this type of error.
  And you can always <code>del</code> your variables when you are done with
  them.  But in practice, the types of errors pointed to are
  common.
</p>
<p>
  A functional approach to our goal eliminates these side-effect
  errors altogether.  A possible bit of code is:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Functional Python code for "print big products"</h4><PRE>bigmuls = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> xs,ys: filter(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> (x,y):x*y &gt; 25, combine(xs,ys))
combine = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> xs,ys: map(None, xs*len(ys), dupelms(ys,len(xs)))
dupelms = <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> lst,n: reduce(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> s,t:s+t, map(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> l,n=n: [l]*n, lst))
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> bigmuls((1,2,3,4),(10,15,3,22))</PRE></div><p>
  We bind our anonymous (<code>lambda</code>) function objects to names in
  the example, but that is not strictly necessary.  We could
  instead simply nest the definitions.  For readability we do it
  this way; but also because <code>combine()</code> is a nice utility
  function to have anyway (produce a list of all pairs of
  elements from two input lists).  <code>dupelms()</code> in turn is mostly
  just a way of helping out <code>combine()</code>.  Even though this
  functional example is more verbose than the imperative example,
  once you consider the utility functions for reuse, the new code
  in <code>bigmuls()</code> itself is probably slightly less than in the
  imperative version.
</p>
<p>
  The real advantage of this functional example is that
  absolutely no variables change any values within it.  There are
  no <strong>possible</strong> unanticipated side-effects on later code (or from
  earlier code).  Obviously, the lack of side-effects, in itself,
  does not guarantee that the code is <em>correct</em>, but it is
  nonetheless an advantage.  Notice, however, that Python (unlike
  many functional languages) does <em>not</em> prevent rebinding of the
  names <code>bigmuls</code>, <code>combine</code> and <code>dupelms</code>.  If <code>combine()</code>
  starts meaning something different later in the program, all
  bets are off.  One could work up a Singleton class to contain
  this type of immutable bindings (as, say, <code>s.bigmuls</code> and so
  on); but this column does not have room for that.
</p>
<p>
  One thing distinctly worth noticing is that our particular goal
  is one tailor-made for a new feature of Python 2.  Rather than
  either the imperative or functional examples given, the best
  (and functional) technique is:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>List-comprehension Python code for "bigmuls"</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> [(x,y) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> x <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> (1,2,3,4) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> y <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> (10,15,3,22) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x*y &gt; 25]</PRE></div><h3>Closure</h3>
 <p>
  This column has demonstrated ways to replace just about every
  Python flow-control construct with a functional equivalent
  (sparing side effects in the process).  Translating a
  particular program efficiently takes some additional thinking,
  but we have seen that the functional built-ins are general and
  complete.  In subsequent columns, we will look at more advanced
  techniques for functional programming; and hopefully we will be
  able to explore some more of the pros and cons of functional
  styles.

  Bryn Keller's "xoltar toolkit" which includes the module
  <em><code>functional</code></em> adds a large number of useful FP extensions to
  Python.  Since the <em><code>functional</code></em> module is itself written
  entirely in Python, what it does was already possible in Python
  itself.  But Keller has figured out a very nicely integrated
  set of extensions, with a lot of power in compact definitions.

  The author has found it much easier to get a grasp of
  functional programming via the language Haskell than in
  Lisp/Scheme (even though the latter is probably more widely
  used, if only in Emacs).  Other Python programmers might
  similarly have an easier time without quite so many parentheses
  and prefix (Polish) operators.
