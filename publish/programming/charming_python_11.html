<h1>Charming Python #11 (20000096)</h1>
<h2>What's New in Python 2.0?</h2>

<blockquote>
    Python programmers have recently gotten a shiny new toy with
    the release of version 2.0.  Python 2.0 builds on the
    strengths of previous Python versions, while adding a number
    of new conveniences and capabilities.  This article contains
    its author's impressions of Python's newest versions, and
    some tips on using it effectively.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python 2?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<p>
  Python 2.0, which was released in October 2000, introduces a
  number of new language features, and includes some new standard
  modules.  One of Guido van Rossum's virtues <em></em> probably the one
  that best earns him the affectionate title "benevolent dictator
  for life (BDFL)" in the Python community <em></em> is his conservatism
  in changing Python.  Very little changes between Python
  versions, and what does change tends to be considered and
  discussed for months or years in advance.  This makes for great
  backward and foreward compatibility in Python, and for a
  consistency in running Python programs across platforms and
  versions.  Therefore, even with a fairly moderate number of
  changes, Python 2.0 represents a pretty large jump in the
  language definition of Python 1.5x.  Fortunately, Python 2.0
  still maintains great backward compatibility, and the changes
  that have been made are generally very "pythonic" in character.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, it is worth noting that a short-lived Python 1.6
  release was made in September 2000.  This release is a bit of a
  curiousity <em></em> its existence derives from contractual
  obligations by the Python core development team, who were
  finding a new organizational home during the same period as the
  1.6/2.0 development.  For the most part Python 1.6 resembles
  Python 2.0, but if you are installing a new version, it is best
  just to install Python 2.0.
</p>
<p>
  Let's look at some specifics.  Check the references for a more
  exhaustive summary of changes.  This article contains a more
  subjective evaluation of what the author finds most important
  and interesting, and some changes might not be addressed here.
</p>
<h3>List Comprehensions And Zip()</h3>
 <p>
  For me, probably the most exciting new feature of Python 2.0 is
  the addition of <em>list comprehensions</em>.  For my oddball readers
  with a math background, it might be interesting to note that
  this capability is sometimes called "ZF-comprehension" in other
  functional languages, after the Axiom of Comprehension in
  Zermelo-Frankel set theory.  If that note does not mean
  anything to you, do not worry about it, the feature is just as
  powerful and intuitive without the mathematical arcana.
</p>
<p>
  If you have been reading carefully, you probably noticed an odd
  noun phrase in the previous paragraph:  "other functional
  languages." Even if you did not realize it, as a Python
  programmer you have been programming in a (mixed) functional
  language since Python 1.0.  Of course, if you are not in the
  habit of using the builtin functions <code>lambda()</code>, <code>map()</code>,
  <code>reduce()</code> and <code>filter()</code> you have not been using these
  functional features; but even if you do use these, Python has
  always made it easy to avoid thinking about functional
  paradigms (unless you want to think about them, which Python
  also makes easy).
</p>
<p>
  In any case, list comprehension is a way of doing much of what
  Python's functional builtins do, but in a much more compact way
  that is simultaneously easier to read and understand.  Let's
  start out with a simple example of list comprehensions in
  action:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; xs = (1,2,3,4,5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ys = (9,8,7,6,5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; bigmuls = [(x,y) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> x <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> xs <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> y <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> ys <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x*y &gt; 25]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> bigmuls
[(3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)]</PRE></div><p>
  What we have done in the example is create a list of tuples
  where each tuple element is drawn from other lists, and where
  each list element satisfies some property.  Without the <code>if</code>
  clause, we would just create a permutation (which is often
  useful in itself); but with the <code>if</code> clause we can create a
  <code>filter()</code> type pruning of the list.  Multiple <code>if</code> clauses are
  allowed in one list comprehension, by the way.
</p>
<p>
  There is nothing fundamentally new in list comprehension
  capability; certainly the same effect could be achieved in
  Python 1.5x, but less clearly.  For example, the following
  more verbose (and less clear) techniques can do the same thing:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Functional-style spagetti for list comprehension</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> (x,y): x*y &gt; 25,
...        map(None, xs*len(ys),
...                  reduce(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> s,t: s+t,
...                         map(<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>lambda</B></FONT> y: [y]*len(xs), ys))))
[(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]

&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Nested loop procedural style for list comprehension</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; bigmuls = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> x <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> xs:
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> y <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> ys:
...         <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x*y &gt; 25:
...             bigmuls.append((x,y))
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> bigmuls
[(3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)]</PRE></div><p>
  In the example I have given, the nested procedural loops are
  clearer than the functional-style calls (perhaps readers will
  notice a better functional approach).  But both are far less clear
  than the list comprehension style.
</p>
<p>
  With some programmer practice, list comprehensions can
  substitute for both most uses of functional-style builtins and
  also for many nested loops.
</p>
<p>
  One new builtin function in Python 2.0 is particularly useful
  in conjunction with list comprehensions.  You can think of what
  <code>zip()</code> does by imagining the teeth of a zipper: two or more
  sequences are combined into a list of tuples (with each tuple
  having one element from each calling sequence.  This is often
  useful if you do not want a list comprehension that uses a
  complete permutation of lists, but merely one that utilized
  corresponding elements of multiple lists.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(xs,ys)
[(1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(x,y) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> (x,y) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> zip(xs, ys) <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> x*y &gt; 20]
[(3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5)]</PRE></div><h3>Unicode</h3>
 <p>
  Another big addition for Python 2.0 is Unicode support.  If you
  need to use multinational character sets in your programs, this
  capability is absolutely essential.  Of course, if like me you
  have not had any specific requirement for characters outside
  ASCII, the Unicode support does not really matter.
  Fortunately, the implementation of Unicode in Python 2.0 is
  extremely well designed, and does not get in the way of
  anything else.
</p>
<p>
  Unicode strings may be represented in several ways.  For
  escaped characters, the sequence "\uHHHH" can be used, where
  <em>HHHH</em> is a four digit hexadecimal number.  Longer string can
  be entered using the new Unicode quoting syntax: u"string".
  This is very similar in style to the r"string" quoting style
  which is used for composing regular expressions without
  resoving escape codes at the Python level (because regular
  expressions use some of the same escape codes).  Of course, to
  use the Unicode quoting syntax, you need to have a text editor
  capable of entering Unicode characters between the quotes.
</p>
<p>
  Conversions between 8-bit strings and Unicode strings <em></em> and
  also between different Unicode encodings <em></em> is performed using
  the new <code>codecs</code> module.
</p>
<h3>Functional/method Call Syntax</h3>
 <p>
  Another nice syntax enhancement was made to function calls.  It
  is now possible to call functions directly with a tuple of
  arguments and/or a dictionary of keyword arguments.  As with
  list comprehensions, no fundamentally new capability is added,
  but the expression of some common chores is more concise and
  more clear.  Methods in Python, of course, are just functions
  that are bound to class instances, so everything works the same
  for functions and methods.
</p>
<p>
  Python programmers will be familiar with the previous syntax
  for defining extra positional and keyword arguments within a
  function definition.  For example, we might have:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="myfunc"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> myfunc</B></FONT></A>(this, that, *extras, **keywords):
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Required arguments:"</FONT>, this, that
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Extra arguments:"</FONT>,
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> arg <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> extras: <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> arg,
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"\nDictionary arguments:"</FONT>
...     <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> key,val <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> keywords.items(): <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"**"</FONT>, key, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"="</FONT>, val
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfunc(1)
Traceback (innermost last):
  File <FONT COLOR=#115511>"&lt;interactive input&gt;"</FONT>, line 1, <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> ?
TypeError: <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>not</B></FONT> enough arguments; expected 2, got 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfunc(1,2)
Required arguments: 1 2
Extra arguments:
Dictionary arguments:
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfunc(1,2,3,4,5)
Required arguments: 1 2
Extra arguments: 3 4 5
Dictionary arguments:
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfunc(1,2,3, spam=17, eggs=32)
Required arguments: 1 2
Extra arguments: 3
Dictionary arguments:
** spam = 17
** eggs = 32</PRE></div><p>
  Python 2.0 adds the same convention for function <em>calls</em> as is
  used for function definitions.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; argdict = {<FONT COLOR=#115511>'spam'</FONT>:<FONT COLOR=#115511>'tasty'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'eggs'</FONT>:<FONT COLOR=#115511>'over easy'</FONT>}
&gt;&gt;&gt; arglist = [1,2,3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfunc(*arglist, **argdict)
Required arguments: 1 2
Extra arguments: 3 4 5
Dictionary arguments:
** spam = tasty
** eggs = over easy</PRE></div><p>
  Achieving the same effect (passing arguments via named lists,
  perhaps ones created dynamically at runtime) was always
  possible in Python.  But the new calling syntax is more
  convenient than the old use of the <code>apply()</code> function was.
</p>
<h3>Augmented Assignment</h3>
 <p>
  Python now has a shortcut in assignments that will be familiar
  to programmers of C, Perl, Awk, Java, and a variety of other
  languages.  It is now possible to stick an operator at the
  beginning of an equal-sign to change the assigned value of a
  variable based on its old value.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; i += 1 ; i
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; i *= 3 ; i
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; i /= 2 ; i
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; str = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Spam and eggs"</FONT>
&gt;&gt;&gt; str += <FONT COLOR=#115511>"...and sausage and spam and bacon"</FONT> ; str
<FONT COLOR=#115511>'Spam and eggs...and sausage and spam and bacon'</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  Semantically, the augmented operators do exactly the same thing
  as repeating the left-side variable on the left side of a plain
  assignment, and following it with the corresponding operator
  and second operand.  So in that sense, this is just syntactic
  sugar.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noticing, however, that the augmented assignments
  are actually an improvement in terms of performance.  I have
  not benchmarked it myself, but discussion indicates that using
  an augmented assignments saves a lookup and some object
  allocation.  For numbers, this is insignificant; but if you
  happen to be working with multi-megabyte strings, use of
  augmented assignment can speed things up and reduce memory
  usage.
</p>
<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>
 <p>
  The issue of Python's memory management is probably pretty
  arcane for most day-to-day Python programmers.  Traditionally,
  Python has used a reference counting scheme to delete objects
  when they are no longer accessible from any name.  However, a
  reference counting methodology is theoretically prone to
  leaking memory if cyclic references are used in a program.  For
  example, this code will break the reference counting:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Cyclical references in Python</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>class</B></FONT><A NAME="MyClass"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> MyClass</B></FONT></A>: <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>pass</B></FONT>
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; myobject = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; myobject.me = myobject
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>del</B></FONT> myobject</PRE></div><p>
  At this point, it is impossible to access <code>myobject</code>, but it
  will not have been deleted, since the reference count was
  incremented twice, but only decremented once.
</p>
<p>
  As bad as this might sound, most programmers will never
  experience any actual problems due to code like the above.  In
  most cases, cyclical references will not be used in the first
  place, and even if they are, most times the memory leakage will
  be small (you can easily construct artificial cases of
  dangerous behavior; for example, add a 'myobject.big='#'*10**6
  to the above example).
</p>
<p>
  In any case, Python 2.0 adds a compile-time option for
  mark-and-sweep garbage collection (GC).  Most distributions of
  Python 2.0 seem to be compiled using this option; but if you
  need to, you can compile your own Python version that turns off
  the garbage collection option.  In either case, reference
  counting is still used, it is just a question of whether leaks
  like the above are cleaned up.
</p>
<p>
  On some platforms, like embedded systems, GC may be
  undesirable.  Garbage collection takes some CPU cycles (not a
  lot, but some).  Perhaps more importantly, reference counting
  is determinate in program behavior, while garbage collection is
  not.  That is, you never know for sure when a garbage
  collection will eat a few CPU cycles; therefore, using the GC
  version of Python will cause the identical program to behave
  differently (in terms of timings) from run to run.
</p>
<p>
  These issues are fascinating theoretically, but most
  programmers should just ignore them from here out.  Whatever
  Python distribution you pick up will almost certainly do the
  right thing for the platform you are using; unless you know
  enough to know exactly why you want to enable or disable GC,
  just do not worry about it.
</p>
<h3>Print Direction</h3>
 <p>
  As good a job as van Rossum and the rest of the team have done
  with Python 2.0, they also introduced one wart in Python.  It
  does something moderately useful, but in my opinion (and also
  in that of many other Python programmers), it introduces a
  brand new (and ugly) syntactic feature where none is needed.
  Most programmers suspect this imperfection is merely a ruse,
  however, to make the simplicity and beauty of the rest of
  Python shine even more brightly.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>print</code> statement performs a bit of magic that the
  <code>.write()</code> method of file objects does not (and sys.stdout is
  just another file object that <code>print</code> writes to).  <code>print</code>
  allows multiple arguments, each of any Python type.  The
  trailing comma conveniently allows line continuation between
  <code>print</code> statements, while the default writes each bunch of
  stuff to its own line.  Overall, <code>print</code> is just a handy way to
  get some information from a program to the console.
</p>
<p>
  A lot of Python programmers have wanted that same <code>print</code> mojo
  to be available for writing to other file objects (such as
  sys.stderr, regular files, or "file-like" objects that various
  modules provide).  I think the right way to do this would be to
  add a <code>.print()</code> method to file objects and do the magic there.
  But Python 2.0 adds this capability by adding the "redirection
  operator" <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to the <code>print</code> statement.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python Interactive Session</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"spam"</FONT>, [1,2,3], 45.2
spam [1, 2, 3] 45.2</PRE></div><p>
  This works <em></em> and it adds a nice capability <em></em> but it nudges
  Python just a hair closer to the "executable line-noise" feel
  of certain other programming languages.
