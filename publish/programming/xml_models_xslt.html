<blockquote>    This series looks at several distinct conceptual models that
    exist for manipulation of XML documents.  XML Stylesheet
    Language Transformations (XSLT) is a declarative approach to
    the transformation of XML documents.  We look at why a
    declarative description of document tranformations is
    desirable?  Why use an XML dialect, as XSLT does, to describe
    the transformations?  What libaries, modules and tools
    perform XSLT?  Source code examples of XSLT stylesheets and
    how they are used to produce output documents are also
    contained in this article.
</blockquote><p><strong class="subhead">About This Series</strong></p>
 <p>  As XML has developed into a widely used data format, a number
  of programming models have arisen for manipulating XML
  documents.  Some of these models--or "paradigms"--have been
  enshrined as standards, while others remain only informally
  specified (but equally widely used nonetheless).  In a general
  way, the several models available for manipulating XML
  documents closely mirror the underlying approaches and
  techniques that programmers in different traditions bring to
  the task of working with XML.  It is worth noticing that
  "models" are at a higher level of abstraction than a particular
  programming language; most of the models discussed in this
  series are associated with APIs that have been implemented in
  multiple programming languages.
</p>
<p>  In part, the richness of available XML programming models
  simply allows programmers and projects to work in the ways that
  are most comfortable and familiar to them.  In many ways, there
  is overlap--at least in achievable outcomes--between all the
  XML programming models.  However, different models also carry
  with them specific pros and cons in the context of XML
  manipulation; and these might urge the use of particular models
  for particular projects.  This series of five articles aims to
  provide readers with an overview of the costs, benefits, and
  motivations for all of the major approaches to programmatic
  manipulation of XML documents (manipulation here, should be
  understood also to mean "using XML to drive or communicate
  other application processes").
</p>
<p>  This article addresses extensible stylesheet language
  transformations (XSLT), version 1.0 of which is a W3C
  Recommendation, and vesion 2.0 of which is currently a W3C
  Working Draft.  In contrast to object-oriented and event-driven
  paradigms discussed in earlier installments, XSLT brings a
  declarative programming style to transformations of XML
  documents.  The first article, Part 1, discussed the OOP-style
  Document Object Model (DOM), which is a W3C Recommendation.
  Part 2 discussed the Simple API for XML (SAX) and similar
  event-driven and procedural styles of XML programming.  In Part
  4, we will see the application of full-fledged Functional
  Programming (FP) techniques to XML manipulation--these in some
  ways unify the earlier models (but are less commonly used).
  The final installment, Part 5, will look briefly at a number of
  tools and techniques that did not quite fit into the previous
  discussion, but that readers would do well to be aware of.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Xslt's Conceptual Framework</strong></p>
 <p>  XSLT lives at a somewhat odd level in the world of program data
  and programming languages.  An XSLT "program" is itself a valid
  XML document, which looks a bit data-like.  However, most any
  programming language could treat its own source files as data,
  so this circularity does not necessarily amount ot all that
  much.  In a more significant way, XSLT files are generally
  thought of more as "instructions" or "configurations" than as
  <em>real</em> programs.  For example, Steven Holzner writes in <cite>Inside
  XSLT</cite> that:
</p>
<blockquote>    XSLT can be read by XSLT processors, which work on XML
    documents for you--all you have to do is create an XSLT
    stylesheet that specifies that rules you want to apply to
    transform one document into another.  No programming is
    needed <em><code>...</code></em>
</blockquote><p>  In a sense, I think Holzner is plainly wrong.  Writing an XSLT
  <strong>is</strong> programming of a certain sort.  But the distinctions
  between "programs" and "rule files" is gradual, the line of Python
  programming that reads:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>INDEX_SIZE_ERR = 1

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Looks a lot like the <code>sendmail.cf</code> configuration line that reads:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>O LogLevel=9

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Or the <code>.ncftp</code> configuration line:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>logsize=10240

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Or even the LaTeX instruction:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>\setlength\parindent{0pt}

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  When figuring out which such similar lines to include for a
  given purpose, the distinction about "how complex" the
  determination is more germane to the issue of whether it is
  "programming" than is a point about whether the underlying
  "language" is Turing-complete, merely a pushdown automaton, or
  whatever (and many readers probably have no immediate intuition
  or knowledge about the above examples).
</p>
<h3>What to do and how to do it
</h3> <p>  It turns out that from a computer-science perspective, XSLT is
  a "complete" programming language.  Dimitre Novatchev
  (dnovatchev@yahoo.com) has written an as-yet-unpublished
  article that I recently reviewed which shows that some fully
  general functional programming techniques can be implemented
  in XSLT using a "hack" on namespaces in XSLT.
</p>
<p>  Whatever might be technically possible, however, XSLT is not
  well suited for general programming.  Moreover, in its
  predominant everyday usage, Holzner correctly characterizes
  XSLT.  XSLT is a way of <em>describing</em> the way you would like an
  XML document to be processed, it is not an application program
  that does the processing.  The actual mechanics of using XSLT
  reinforce the common conception.  An actual transformation is
  peformed either from a command-line, or from a function call
  (from many programming languages).  In either case, the XML
  document to be processed and the XSLT stylesheet are the two
  "input" elements to the actual processing.  For example:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>% xsltproc mystyle.xslt mydoc.xml &gt; output.xml

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Or within an application program (from C/C++ in the example):
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>out = xsltApplyStylesheet(mystyle, mydoc, parms);

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  As background to understanding what XSLT does, it is important
  to understand the difference between <em>declarative</em> and
  <em>imperative</em> programming.  The most commonly used programming
  languages--including those normally used with DOM or SAX--are
  predominantly imperative in style.  In C, C++, Java, Python,
  Perl, TCL, Visual Basic, Delphi, shell script and most other
  languages, a computer program basically lists a temporal
  collection of steps that the programmer wants the computer to
  take.  Branching, looping, and subroutine calling mean that the
  program does not usually start at the first line, end at the
  last line, and visit each line between in order.  But each
  actual run of an imperative program consists of actions that
  are peformed for their side-effects--e.g. storing a value to
  a mutable variable or causing I/O to occur.
</p>
<p>  A SAX application is an obvious imperative system.  It says--in
  short--respond to this tag, respond to that tag, then respond
  to yet another tag, until some termination is reached.  But a
  DOM application is equally imperative.  An early step is
  usually "build the DOM" tree; but after that a series of
  actions like moving and creating nodes occurpy the application.
  Often near the end, a modified DOM tree is written back to XML.
</p>
<h3>Declarative languages
</h3> <p>  In contrast to the most used imperative programming language,
  there also exists a number of <em>declarative</em> programming
  languages.  These are often divided into logical and functional
  variants; Prolog and Mercury are in the former category, while
  Haskell, ML, Clean, Lisp, Scheme and others are in the latter
  camp.  XSLT is also clearly and strongly in the declarative
  family of programming languages (it is a bit too limited,
  however, to be fully either "functional" or "logical").
  Moreover, even "little languages" like specialized
  configuration files can be considered declarative also.
  Depending on just how limited they are, such configuration
  files may or may not be programming languages, but they are
  <em>declarative</em> either way.
</p>
<p>  Declarative programming has much more in common with
  mathematics than does traditional imperative programming (which
  is closer to certain engineering or mechanical practices).
  Consider a set of linear equations like the below:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>10x + 5y -  7z + 1 = 0
17x + 5y - 10z + 3 = 0
 5x - 4y +  3z - 6 = 0

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  One "declares" a certain collection of relations must obtain.
  There is no temporal order in these declarations.  And no
  "assignment" is really made to variables in this mathematical
  sense.
</p>
<p>  In order to solve these equations with a computer, ultimately
  the CPU will carry out some series of instructions in linear
  temporal order.  But a declarative programmer does not want or
  need to worry about what the CPU actually does.  She merely
  writes down statments of facts that make up the specification.
  Sometimes those statments involve intermediate placeholders and
  functions (in the mathematical sense of "function"), but these
  intermediaries are themselves unordered and non-assigning.
</p>
<p>  Rather than a set of mathematical relations, what an XSLT
  stylesheet declares is simply what occurs in the output of a
  stylesheet application.  How it gets there is not for a
  programmer/developer to worry about.  The XSLT creator just
  indicates <strong>what</strong> goes in the output.  In this sense an XSLT
  stylesheet is a sort of template for a result.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Xslt At Work</strong></p>
 <p>  To get a sense of what XSLT does, it is best to look at some
  real-world examples.  What is presented here will not explore
  the full richness of the XSLT tag set, but it will give a feel
  for the most important tags.
</p>
<p>  I have a document that I have marked up in a popular XML
  dialect called DocBook, which is well suited to academic
  books--the example document is one chapter of a larger
  work, and therefore has a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> element as its root.  We
  will use that for some below examples of XSLT stylesheets that
  templatize an HTML version of a DocBook XML document.  That is,
  the processing we are interested in for the example is
  transforming a DocBook dialect XML document into an HTML output
  format.  While this type of application is common, one could
  equally well create an XML or cutom-format output from the
  processing.
</p>
<h3>A trivial stylesheet
</h3> <p>  The most important tag in XSLT stylesheets is probably
  <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code>.  Generally, every template will
  include this tag somewhere in its body.  The purpose of this
  tag is to allow a developer to declare that "whenever
  such-and-such is encountered in the input, put the following in
  the output":
</p>
<p><strong>Minimal Chapter XSLT Document (minimal.xls)</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter"&gt;
    ----- Start of Chapter -----
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;
    ##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  When we run an XSLT processor using this stylesheet and a
  DocBook chapter, we get something like:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>----- Start of Chapter -----
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
##### Unmatched Element in Source #####

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  This output is not all that useful, but it lets us see what the
  stylesheet is doing.  The root element of a chapter is the
  <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> element.  That matches, and announces the chapter
  starts.  Within the <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> element various children occur,
  each such child is called something other than <code>chapter</code>, and
  so will pass matching to the "*" template.
</p>
<p>  There is one other important XSLT tag to notice in the
  <code>minimal.xls</code> example.  The <code>&lt;xsl:apply-template/&gt;</code> element is
  used when we want to indicate something additional is contained
  in the output which needs to be determined based on the
  particular input XML document.  For example, when a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>
  element is encountered, we want to write some literal
  characters in the output, but we also want to let the <strong>content</strong>
  of the input <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> element trigger other template elements.
  On the other hand, for the generic <code>match="*"</code> pattern in the
  above example, we output some characters, but do not look for
  anything else to do.
</p>
<h3>A semi-useful stylesheet
</h3> <p>  Now for something that produces some real HTML output when
  processed:
</p>
<p><strong>Valid HTML Outputter XSLT Document</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter"&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="title"/&gt;
        &lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="chapter/title"&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="para"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;
    ##### Unmatched Element in Source #####
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  This HTML-outputter shows some realistic features of an XSLT
  stylesheet.  Inside the <code>chapter</code> match template, we lay out
  the HTML document we want to produce.  There is little special
  about the XHTML tags inside the template match; any text we put
  there will appear in the output (but we cannot include tags
  that are not in the <code>xsl</code> or default XHTML namespace).  Within
  the HTML <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, we use the <code>&lt;xsl:value-of&gt;</code>
  instruction to insert the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> subelement required inside
  a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> in DocBook.  In the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, we
  pass control on to other templates (presumably quite a few for
  all of DocBook; but most are not yet included in the example).
</p>
<p>  The next template after <code>chapter</code> is <code>chapter/title</code>.  This
  means to match a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, but only if it occurs
  directly inside a <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>.  If we had wanted we could have
  simply matched <code>title</code> and thereby specified the output format
  of every <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element in the source document.  But we
  eventually want to format chapter titles differently from
  <code>&lt;sect1&gt;</code> titles, <code>&lt;sect2&gt;</code> titles, and so on.  We perform a
  general match with <code>para</code> in the example (but it never actually
  matches, because <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> can only occur inside tags we have
  not yet matched).  For good measure, we still match "*" which
  lets us see that our stylesheet is not complete when we examine
  its output.
</p>
<h3>Rounding out our XSLT stylesheet
</h3> <p>  So far we have declared enough about our desired output format
  to get some minimal HTML markup.  But most of our input XML
  document is still ignored.  This might be what is desired for
  certain purposes, but our goal here is to come up with a way of
  formatting as HTML most or all of the DocBook original.  The
  Resources section has links to some additional XSLT stylesheets
  that complete the specification.  But conceptually, the full
  specification looks like an mere elaboration of the basic
  stylesheet.
</p>
<p>  There is one particular XSLT construct worth mentioning here
  still.  We have seen that the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> are able
  to "descend" into elements of an input XML document.  This
  descent is basically just a form of recursion--a technique that
  should be familiar to all programmers.  Matching templates by
  descent is not the only trick XSLT can do, however.  You can
  also do conditional outputting, sorting, pull out source
  attributes, and looping over children.  For this column, let us
  look at looping:
</p>
<p><strong>XSLT template for looping over subelements</strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;xsl:template match="simplelist"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select="member"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Rather than descend to every subelement in a <code>simplelist</code>, we
  just assume subelements are all <code>&lt;member&gt;</code> elements.  The
  <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> works much like a nested template, and also
  much like a programming-language loop construct.  The contents
  of the <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> element will go to the output for every
  subelement that matches the <code>select</code> attribute.  Within the
  loop, the contents of the current <code>&lt;member&gt;</code> element become the
  active node that descends down to the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>
  tag we find inside the loop.  That is, each thing in the list
  might have further markup inside it, and we pass formatting of
  those elements to their appropriate templates (for text nodes,
  they are just ouput in literal form).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">The Good And The Bad Of Xslt</strong></p>
 <p>  Having presented a glimpse of XSLT in action, I should come
  clean with my own opinion.  I really do not like XSLT very
  much, despite its widespread popularity.  At heart, I do not
  think there is anything that XSLT does better than
  alternatives, and would therefore be unlikely to choose this
  technology in a situation where I had design control.  I'll try
  to describe why.  But understand in my explanation, that the
  author is in a very distinct minority; a large number--maybe a
  majority--of developers seem enormously enthused by XSLT.
</p>
<p>  One can understand the character of XSLT from the above few
  examples.  Each XSLT element declares something about what goes
  in the output, and contains a "picture" of that output.  At
  runtime, the implementing XSLT utility will carry out the
  description in one element, then that in another, but the
  declarations may occur in any order in the XSLT file itself.
  The flow is driven entirely by the content and structure of the
  source XML document.  All this is very different from
  imperative programming, like SAX or DOM.
</p>
<p>  The declarative character of XSLT is--to my mind--a very strong
  point for it.  Being able to simply state <strong>what</strong> needs to be in
  the output of a transformation is less error prone--and in
  principle easier--than writing a step-by-step guide for how the
  output is generated.  But this good point of XSLT is limited.
  One can declare certain things with XSLT, but there are many
  other areas where the limitations of XSLT fail to be as general
  as a process requires.  In these circumstances, the functional
  programming approaches that the next installment will discuss
  are simply more powerful and general.  To use XSLT is to jump
  into a project hoping that requirements will not evolve in such
  a way as to make the tool useless.  Sometimes such a hope turns
  out fine; but why take on the risk to start with if it is not
  necessary?  By starting down an XSLT path, one risks
  encountering unpleasant dead ends.
</p>
<p>  An explanation of just where XSLT falls short needs to wait for
  the next installment on functional programming (FP) techniques
  for XML.  But it suffices to note here that those FP tools are
  just as declarative as XSLT.  The limitations might be worth
  incurring and/or risking if XSLT was itself a simple
  programming language.  But it really is not--certainly not the
  way the configuration file examples given above are.  To work
  with XSLT, one still needs to learn a large number of tags and
  rules, and go through quite a bit of design and debugging
  process.  Basically, an XSLT project is a programming project,
  with all the complexity that entails.  Accepting limitations
  are not rewarded with gaining simplicity.
</p>
<p>  One obvious area of complexity in XSLT is its syntax.  Every
  XSLT document is a well-formed XML document (and more-or-less
  valid, but some namespace issues exist between XSLT versions).
  Many developers apparently feel that an advantage occurs by
  making XSLT "programs" instances of the same XML markup style
  that they operate upon.  The thought here is that the same
  validation and transformation tools used for primrary XML
  documents can in turn be used for XSLT stylesheets too.
</p>
<p>  In practice, I have never really encountered significant
  programmatic manipulation of XSLT stylesheets--generally XSLT,
  like programming language source files, are written and
  modified by human beings not by automated processes.  As such,
  the difficulty of an XML syntax simply gets in the way of
  writing and reading the stylesheets.  Moreover, every
  programming language already has at least one perfectly good
  "program validator"--it is called a compiler or interpreter.
  By writing an XML processing application in a "regular"
  programming language, one automatically gets the ability to
  validate the source code for syntactic correctness.  XSLT is
  not special in this advantage.
</p>
<p>  In terms of efficiency, XSLT has no huge virtue.  Most XSLT
  implementations seem to be built on top of a DOM parser.
  Therefore, all the overhead of DOM parsing applies to XSLT
  (i.e. in-memory image of the entire XML document).  Even if not
  DOM-based, and XSLT utility or library is almost required to
  work on an image of an entire XML file.  XSLT has no
  disadvantage over DOM here, nor over most of the FP techniques
  we will look at later; but XSLT lacks the potential for memory
  efficiency that SAX offers.  At any rate, the cumbersome
  aspects of writing XSLT are not balanced by any great speed of
  execution.
