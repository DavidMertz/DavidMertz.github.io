    Several modules and tools introduced in recent versions of
    Python have improved Python not so much as a language, but as
    a <em>tool</em>.  The modules discussed in this column make the job
    of Python developers substantially easier by improving the
    documentation and distribution of Python modules and
    packages.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  One year ago, if you were to ask an honest Python evangelist
  if Python was missing anything important that Perl, for
  example, had, she would have to fess up an affirmative answer.
  It wasn't that Python lacked a breadth of module and package
  support--both Python native and extension modules.  It
  certainly wasn't the clarity of expression or clean object
  orientation in which Python positively excels.  What Python was
  missing was what Perl developers describe as "social factors."
  But even here, the missing social factors were not an absence
  of an active, intelligent and supportive Python
  community--Python has abounded in that.  What the Python of one
  year ago sorely lacked was a sufficient programmatic
  infrastructure for the sharing of Python code.  Code sharing
  was ad hoc, decentralized, and just plain too much work in the
  general case.
</p>
<p>
  The first step in improving the social infrastructure of Python
  was probably Tim Middleton's creation of the Vaults of
  Parnassus (see Resources).  For the first time, Python
  developers had a single place to turn for (nearly) all
  contributed third-party modules, packages and tools.  The
  Vaults still have their quirks that make them possibly less
  advanced (but nicer looking) than the Comprehensive Perl
  Archive Network.  The Vaults merely point to actual resources
  rather than mirroring them; the Vaults are manually maintained
  by Middleton, and updates are sometimes slow to happen; and
  vex.net who generously hosts the Vaults has had intermittent
  outages.  But overall, the service provided by the Vaults of
  Parnassus has been an invaluable resource in building the
  architectural prerequisites of a strong Python community.
</p>
<p>
  With such a common site available, all the Python community
  needed was consistent and solid ways of installing all these
  available modules, packages and tools; and equally clear ways
  of figuring out just what they did.  To the rescue came several
  new standard modules in the standard Python distribution..
</p>
<h3><em><code>pydoc</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  Ka-Ping Yee has created a quite remarkable module by the name
  <em><code>pydoc</code></em> (for the "competition":  <em><code>pydoc</code></em> does everything that
  <code>perldoc</code> does, but better and prettier :-)).  As of Python
  2.1, <em><code>pydoc</code></em> (and its supporting <em><code>inspect</code></em>) is part of the
  standard library.  However, for users of Python 1.5.2, 1.6 or
  2.0, downloading and installing <em><code>pydoc</code></em> is extremely easy--do
  so right away (see Resources).
</p>
<p>
  By way of background for any Python beginners reading this,
  Python has long had some semi-formal documentation standards.
  These standards have not attempted to contrain developers
  unduly, but rather simply to seem like the "one obvious way to
  do it."  Fortunately, Python developers, as a rule, have always
  been far better documenters than typical developers in other
  languages.
</p>
<p>
  The main element of good Python documentation is the use of
  so-called "docstrings."  While a docstring is really just a
  variable called <code><cite>_doc_</cite></code>, there is a ubiquitous shortcut for
  creating them:  just put a bare (triple-)quoted string at the
  very beginning of a module, function <code>def</code>, class definition,
  or method <code>def</code>.  As well, there are several more-or-less
  standard module-level "magic" variable names that are often
  used.  Despite the informality of the documentation rules,
  almost all 3rd party and standard modules use the same
  patterns.  Let's look at a simplistic example that has most of
  the elements used:
</p>

        """</FONT>
        self.spam = spam
        self.eggs = eggs</PRE></div><p>
  The <em><code>pydoc</code></em> module takes advantage of Python documentation
  conventions, as well as having some savvy about Python imports,
  inheritance, and the like.  Moreover, <em><code>pydoc</code></em> has the absolute
  genius of allowing itself to be used in multiple modes of
  operation.  More on this shortly; for a few moments I'll look
  at the <code>manpage</code> style usage at an OS command-line.
</p>
<p>
  Let's say you had the above module <em><code>mymod</code></em> installed on your
  system, but weren't sure what it was for (not much in the
  example).  You might read the source, but even easier might be:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Getting 'manpage' style documentation</h4><pre>
% pydoc.py mymod
Python Library Documentation: module mymod

NAME

</pre></div><p>
  Depending on your specific platform and setup, the above sample
  will probably be presented in a text viewer that allows
  scrolling, searching, and so on, and with some highlighting of
  key words.  For something this simple, what you get is only
  slightly better than just reading the source, but consider
  something as as simple as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Examining the inheritance structure of a class</h4><pre>
% cat mymod2.py
from mymod import MyClass

class MyClass2(MyClass):
    """Child class"""
    def foo(self):
        pass

% pydoc.py mymod2.MyClass2
Python Library Documentation: class MyClass2 in mymod2

class MyClass2(mymod.MyClass)
 |  Child class
 |
 |  __init__(self, spam=1, eggs=2) from mymod.MyClass
 |
 |  foo(self)

</pre></div><p>
  In this quick report we can tell not only that <code>MyClass2</code> has
  the methods <code>__init__()</code> and <code>foo()</code> (and the arguments
  thereto), but also which methods are implemented locally, and
  which other methods come from ancestors (and where those
  ancestors live).
</p>
<p>
  Another nice <code>manpage</code> like feature is the <code>-k</code> option for
  searching modules for keywords.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Locating the right module for a task</h4><pre>
% pydoc.py -k uuencode
uu - Implementation of the UUencode and UUdecode functions.

% pydoc.py uu
Python Library Documentation: module uu

NAME
    uu - Implementation of the UUencode and UUdecode functions.
[...]

</pre></div><p>
  Besides its command-line usage, <em><code>pydoc</code></em> has four other "modes"
  that can present the same generated documentation.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Shell mode</strong> <em></em> Inside the Python interactive shell, you may
    import <em><code>pydoc</code></em>'s <code>help()</code> function, and get assistance on any
    object without leaving the interactive session.  You can also
    just type <code>help</code> by itself to get into an interactive "help
    interpreter."  For example:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      #------- Interactive shell with help enhancements -------#
      &gt;&gt;&gt; from pydoc import help
      &gt;&gt;&gt; import uu
      &gt;&gt;&gt; help(uu.test)
      Help on function test in module uu:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      test()
          uuencode/uudecode main program
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; help
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      Welcome to Python 2.0!  This is the online help utility.
      <em><code>...introductory message about help shell...</code></em>
      help&gt;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Webserver mode</strong> <em></em> Just use the <code>-p</code> option, and <em><code>pydoc</code></em>
    will launch itself as a simple webserver on LOCALHOST.  You
    can use any web browser to browse all the modules installed
    on the current system.  The homepage for this server is a
    list of modules, grouped by directory (and with attractive
    color blocks for browsers supporting that).  Moreover, every
    module whose documentation you view becomes generously
    littered with links to any modules, functions and methods it
    imports.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>HTML generator mode</strong> <em></em> The <code>-w</code> option can generate an HTML
    documentation page for anything <em><code>pydoc</code></em> can document.  Pretty
    much, these pages are the same thing you might browse in
    webserver mode, but the pages are static and available for
    archiving, transmission, etc.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>TK browser mode</strong> <em></em> The <code>-g</code> option will create a "graphical
    help browser," much along the lines of <code>xman</code> or <em><code>tkman</code></em>.
</blockquote>
<h3><em><code>distutils</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  As of Python 1.6, a package called <em><code>distutils</code></em> has become part of
  the standard Python library.  There are two aspects to what
  <em><code>distutils</code></em> does.  On the one side, <em><code>distutils</code></em> hopes to make
  installation of new modules, packages, and tools uniform and
  easy for end-users.  On the other side, <em><code>distutils</code></em> also hopes
  to make the creation of these easy-to-install distributions
  easy on their developers.  Let's look at both aspects briefly.
</p>
<p>
  In the very simplest case, a developer will have chosen to
  create an installer for your specific platform.  If this is the
  case, you really don't need to know that anything called
  <em><code>distutils</code></em> exists at all.  Currently, <em><code>distutils</code></em> is capable
  of creating RPMs for those Linux systems that support that
  format, and Windows EXE self-installers for Win32 systems.
  While these are big players, other platforms exist also and/or
  the developer might have had access to your platform (or the
  time or interest in making an installer).
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, short of the simplest case, the next best case is
  hardly any more difficult.  Assuming you get a <em><code>distutils</code></em>
  aware source distribution, you can count on a number of things
  (if nothing goes wrong, of course).  The distribution archive
  should be in a standard archive format--usually either <code>.zip</code> or
  <code>.tgz</code> / <code>.tar.gz</code> (in odd cases you might find <code>.tbz</code> or
  <code>tar.Z</code>, and hopefully <code>.sit</code> support will be added for MacOS
  soon).  Most of the time, Windows users use zip's and
  Linux/Unix users use tarballs.  But it is not hard to unpack
  most formats on most platforms.  Once you have unpacked the
  archive, you'll get a collection of files in a directory named
  in the same fashion as the archive was.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Unpacking a [distutils] archive</h4><pre>
E:\archive\devel&gt;unzip -q Distutils-1_0_2.zip
E:\archive\devel&gt;cd Distutils-1.0.2
E:\archive\devel\Distutils-1.0.2&gt;ls

The volume label in drive E is ARCHIVE.
The Volume Serial Number is E825:C814.

</pre></div><p>
  Most module distributions will have fewer files and directories
  than this one.  The only thing you really need is the file
  <code>setup.py</code>, which contains instructions for the install.
  Realistically though, one hopes that there are <em>some</em> other
  files in the directory so that <code>setup.py</code> has something to
  install.  From here, all you need to do is:
</p>
<blockquote>
    E:\archive\devel\Distutils-1.0.2&gt; python setup.py install
</blockquote>
<p>
  At least that <em>should</em> be all you need to do.  If something
  goes wrong, read the <code>README.txt</code> or <code>README</code> file which is
  likely to be included.  And after that, check out Greg Ward's
  "Installing Python Modules" (see Resources).
</p>
<p>
  But what is going on "under the hood?"  As you can guess from
  the name, <code>setup.py</code> is really just a plain Python script, so
  it can do <em>anything</em> when it runs.  But in almost all cases,
  <code>setup.py</code> will have a pretty stereotypical form.  It might
  look something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Minimal setup.py installation script</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC>#!/usr/bin/env python</FONT>

<FONT COLOR=#115511>"""Setup script for the sample #1 module distribution:
   single top-level pure Python module, named explicitly
   in 'py_modules'."""</FONT>

<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> distutils.core <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> setup

setup (<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Distribution meta-data</FONT>
       name = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"sample"</FONT>,
       version = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"1.0"</FONT>,
       description = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Distutils sample distribution #1"</FONT>,

       <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Description of modules and packages in the distribution</FONT>
       py_modules = [<FONT COLOR=#115511>'sample'</FONT>],
      )</PRE></div><p>
  The real work here is performed by the imported <em><code>distutils</code></em>,
  specifically by the <code>setup()</code> function.  Basically, <code>setup()</code>
  takes a bunch of named arguments, including a list of things to
  install (besides <code>py_modules</code>, there might be <code>packages</code> or
  <code>ext_modules</code> or some other things).
</p>
<p>
  The magic of <em><code>distutils</code></em> is that <em>creating</em> a module
  distribution uses the very same <code>setup.py</code> file as installing
  it does.  Once you--the module developer--have created a
  <code>setup.py</code> script (and maybe 'setup.cfg or other adjuncts) that
  specifies what needs to get installed, all you need to do to
  create the distribution is (one or more of the following):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% python setup.py sdist
% python setup.py bdist_wininst
% python setup.py bdist_rpm

</pre></div><p>
  Depending on which specific distribution you specify, you will
  create either a standard archive (tarball or zip file,
  depending on platform) or a full installer (as discussed above).
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  We are not quite there yet, but Python is getting to be not
  just one of the easiest to use programming <em>languages</em>, but
  also one of the easiest to use programming <em>communities</em>.  Some
  of these new tools still have one or two kinks to iron out
  still, but in a general way, everything one needs to make
  Python "transparent" to users has been put in place.

  Another new module that helps in assuring the quality and

  The latest <em><code>distutils</code></em> can be found at the below link.  For
  most user of Python 1.6+, it is easiest to stick with the

  Greg Ward's <cite>Installing Python Modules</cite> is a good introduction
  to the end-user of <em><code>distutils</code></em>.  If you download a current
  Python documentation set, you get a version of this document.
  But the current version of the document should probably be at:
