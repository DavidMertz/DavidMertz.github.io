    The first installment in this series on Twisted introduced
    asynchronous server programming.  While a web server is, in
    a sense, just another network service, Twisted provides a
    number of higher-level techniques for writing web services.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In a lot of ways, the low-level aspects of Twisted are the
  easiest to jump into. Even though aysynchronous, non-blocking
  styles are somewhat novel for developers accustomed to threading,
  a new protocol can follow the examples in the Twisted Matrix
  documentation.  The higher-level tools for web development are
  undergoing more rapid flux, and have more API details to learn.
  In fact, Twisted's web templating framework, -woven-, while
  becoming quite sophisticated, is unstable enough that I will
  only touch on it here.

  A note on the name of the Twisted library is worthwhile.
  "Twisted Matrix Laboratories" is the name a geographically
  diverse group of developers call themselves, with a certain
  levity.  The Python library for event-driven network
  programming is called just "Twisted"--my last column did not
  carefully distinguish the group from the product.


ENHANCING THE WEBLOG SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We looked earlier at a slightly-better-than-trivial server that
  used a custom protocol, with custom servers and clients, to
  remotely monitor hits to a web site. For this installment, let us
  enhance that functionality with a web-based interface. A certain
  URL can be used, in our scenario, to watch hits a web site
  receives.

  There is a very simple approach to a web-based web-log server
  that has nothing to do with Twisted -per se-. Suppose that you
  you simply let a web page like 'weblog.html' list some
  information about the latest few hits to a web site. In keeping
  with the prior examples, we will display the referrer and
  resource of a hit, but only when the request has a status code of
  '200' (and referrer is available). An example of such a page
  (that is not being updated for content) can be found at:

    http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/weblog.html

  What we need to do is two things: (1) Put a '<meta
  http-equiv=refresh ...>' tag in the HTML header to keep the
  display up-to-date; (2) Rewrite the 'weblog.html' file itself
  intermittently when new hits occur. The second task only requires
  a background process that is left running, e.g.:

      #---------- logmaker.py web-log refresher script ---------#
      from webloglib import log_fields, TOP, ROW, END, COLOR
      import webloglib as wll
      from urllib import unquote_plus as uqp
      import os, time
      LOG = open('../access-log')
      RECS = []
      PAGE = 'www/weblog.html'
      while 1:
          page = open(PAGE+'.tmp','w')
          RECS.extend(LOG.readlines())
          RECS = RECS[-35:]
          print >> page, TOP
          odd = 0
          for rec in RECS:
              hit = [field.strip('"') for field in log_fields(rec)]
              if hit[wll.status]=='200' and hit[wll.referrer]!='-':
                  resource = hit[wll.request].split()[1]
                  referrer = uqp(hit[wll.referrer]).replace('&amp;',' &')
                  print >> page, ROW % (COLOR[odd], referrer, resource)
                  odd = not odd
          print >> page, END
          page.close()
          os.rename(PAGE+'.tmp',PAGE)
          time.sleep(5)

  The precise HTML used is contained in the module [webloglib],
  along with some constants for log field positions.  You can
  download that module from the URL listed in the Resources
  section, if you wish.

  Notice here that you do not even need to use Twisted as a
  server--'Apache' or any other web server works fine.

CREATING A TWISTED WEB SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Running a Twisted web server is quite simple--perhaps even
  easier than launching other servers. The first step in running
  a Twisted web server is creating a '.tap' file, as we saw in
  the first installment. You -can- create a '.tap' file by
  defining an application in a script, including a call to
  'application.save()', and running the script.  But you can also
  create a '.tap' file using the tool 'mktap'.  In fact, for many
  common protocols, you can create a server '.tap' file without
  any special script at all.  For example:

      mktap web --path ~/twisted/www --port 8080

  This creates a fairly generic server that serves files out of
  the base directory '~/twisted/www' on port '8080'. To run the
  server, use the tool 'twistd' to launch the created 'web.tap'
  file:

      twistd -f web.tap

  For servers of types other than HTTP, you could also use other
  names in place of 'web': 'dns', 'conch', 'news', 'telnet',
  'im', 'manhole', and others.  Some of those name familiar
  servers, others are special to Twisted.  And more are added all
  the time.

  Any static HTML files that happen to live in the base directory
  are delivered by the server, much as with other servers. But in
  addition, you may serve dynamic pages that have the extension
  '.rpy'--in concept, these are like CGI scripts, but they avoid
  the forking overhead and interpreter startup time that slows down
  CGI. A Twisted dynamic script is arranged slightly differently
  than a CGI script, in the simplest case it can look something
  like:

      #-------------- www/dynamic.rpy Twisted page ------------#
      from twisted.web import resource
      page = '''<html><head><title>Dynamic Page</title></head>
      <body>
        <p>Dynamic Page served by Twisted Matrix</p>
      </body>
      </html>'''
      class Resource(resource.Resource):
          def render(self, request):
              return page
      resource = Resource()

  The file-level variable 'resource' is special--it needs to
  point to an instance of a 'twisted.web.resource.Resource'
  child, where its class defines a '.render()' method.  You can
  include as many dynamic pages as you like within the directory
  served, and each will be served automatically.

USING TWISTED TO UPDATE A STATIC PAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The timed callback technique presented in my first Twisted
  installment can be used to periodically update the 'weblog.html'
  file discussed above. That is, you can substitute a non-blocking
  'twisted.internet.reactor.callLater()' calls for the
  'time.sleep()' call in 'logmaker.py':

      #--------- tlogmaker.py web-log refresher script ---------#
      from webloglib import log_fields, TOP, ROW, END, COLOR
      import webloglib as wll
      from urllib import unquote_plus as uqp
      import os, twisted.internet
      LOG = open('../access-log')
      RECS = []
      PAGE = 'www/weblog.html'
      def update():
          global RECS
          page = open(PAGE+'.tmp','w')
          RECS.extend(LOG.readlines())
          RECS = RECS[-35:]
          print >> page, TOP
          odd = 0
          for rec in RECS:
              hit = [field.strip('"') for field in log_fields(rec)]
              if hit[wll.status]=='200' and hit[wll.referrer]!='-':
                  resource = hit[wll.request].split()[1]
                  referrer = uqp(hit[wll.referrer]).replace('&amp;',' &')
                  print >> page, ROW % (COLOR[odd], referrer, resource)
                  odd = not odd
          print >> page, END
          page.close()
          os.rename(PAGE+'.tmp',PAGE)
          twisted.internet.reactor.callLater(5, update)
      update()
      twisted.internet.reactor.run()

  There is not much difference between 'logmaker.py' and
  'tlogmaker.py'--both can be launched in the background and left
  running to update the page 'referesher.html'.  What would be
  more interesting would be to build 'tlogmaker.py' directory
  into a Twisted server, rather than simply have it run in a
  background process.  Easy enough, we just need two more lines
  at the end of the script:

      from twisted.web import static
      resource = static.File("~/twisted/www")

  The call to 'twisted.internet.reactor.run()' may also be
  removed.  With these changes, create a server using:

      mktap --resource-script=tlogmaker.py --port 8080
            --path ~/twisted/www

  And run the created 'web.tap' server using 'twistd', as before.
  Now the web server itself will refresh the page 'weblog.html'
  every five seconds, using its standard core dispath loop.

MAKING THE WEBLOG A DYNAMIC PAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Another approach to serving the web log is to use a dynamic
  page to generate the most recent hits each time they are
  requested.  However, it is a bad idea to read the entire
  'access-log' file each time such a request is received--a busy
  website is likely to have many thousands of records in a log
  file, reading those repeatedly is time-consuming.  A better
  approach is to let the Twisted server itself hold a file
  handle for the log file, and only read -new- records when
  needed.

  In a way, having the server maintain a file handle is just what
  'tlogmaker.py' does, but it stores the latest records in a file
  rather than in memory.  However, that approach forces us to
  write the whole server around this persistence function.  It is
  more elegant to let individual dynamic pages make their own
  persistence requests to the server.  This way, for example, you
  can add new stateful dynamic pages without stopping or altering
  the long-running (and generic) server.  The key to
  page-allocated persistence is Twisted's -registry-.  For
  example, here is a dynamic page that serves the weblog:

      #-------- www/weblog.rpy dynamic web-log page ------------#
      from twisted.web import resource, server
      from persist import Records
      from webloglib import log_fields, TOP, ROW, END, COLOR
      import webloglib as wll

      records = registry.getComponent(Records)
      if not records:
         records = Records()
         registry.setComponent(Records, records)

      class Resource(resource.Resource):
          def render(self, request):
              request.write(TOP)
              odd = 0
              for rec in records.getNew():
                  print rec
                  hit = [field.strip('"') for field in log_fields(rec)]
                  if hit[wll.status]=='200' and hit[wll.referrer]!='-':
                      resource = hit[wll.request].split()[1]
                      referrer = hit[wll.referrer].replace('&amp;',' &')
                      request.write(ROW % (COLOR[odd],referrer,resource))
                      odd = not odd
              request.write(END)
              request.finish()
              return server.NOT_DONE_YET
      resource = Resource()

  One thing that is initially confusing about the registry is that
  it is never imported by 'weblog.rpy'. An '.rpy' script is not
  quite the same as a plain '.py' script--the former runs -within-
  the Twisted environment, which provides automatic access to
  'register' among other things. The 'request' object is another
  thing that comes from the framework rather than the '.rpy'
  itself.

  Notice also the somewhat new style of returning the page
  contents. Rather than just return an HTML string, in the above,
  we cache several writes to the 'request' object, then finish them
  up with the call to 'request.finish()'. The odd looking return
  value 'server.NOT_DONE_YET' is a flag to the Twisted server to
  flush the page content out of the 'request' object. Another
  option is to add a Deferred object to the request, and serve the
  page when the callback to the Deferred is performed (for example,
  if the page cannot be generated until a database query
  completes).

CREATING PERSISTENT OBJECTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Notice the little conditional logic at the top of 'weblog.rpy'.
  The first time the dynamic page is served, no 'Records' object
  has yet been added to the registry. But after that first time,
  we want to keep using the same object for each call to
  'records.getNew()'. The call to 'registry.getComponent()'
  returns the registered object of the appropriate class if it can,
  otherwise it returns a false value to allow testing. Between
  calls, of course, the object is maintained in the address space
  of the Twisted server.

  A persistence class should best live in a module that the '.rpy'
  file imports. This way, every dynamic page can utilize
  persistence classes you write. Any sort of persistence you like
  can be contained in the instance attributes. However, some things
  like open files cannot be saved between shutdowns of the server
  (simple values, however, can be persisted between server runs,
  and are saved in a file like 'web-shutdown.tap'). The module
  [persist] that I use contains one very simple class, 'Counter',
  that is borrowed from the Twisted Matrix documentation, and
  another, 'Records', that I use for the web-log dynamic page:

      #-------- Persistence support module persist.py ----------#
      class Counter:
          def __init__(self):
              self.value = 0
          def increment(self):
              self.value += 1
          def getValue(self):
              return self.value
      class Records:
          def __init__(self, log_name='../access-log'):
              self.log = open(log_name)
              self.recs = self.log.readlines()
          def getNew(self):
              self.recs.extend(self.log.readlines())
              self.recs = self.recs[-35:]
              return self.recs

  You are perfectly free to put whatever methods you like in
  persistence classes--the registry simply holds instances in
  memory between different calls to dynamic pages.

FOR NEXT TIME
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In this installment, we have looked at the basics of Twisted web
  servers. A basic server--or even one with minor custom code--is
  easy to setup. But greater power is available in the
  [twisted.web.woven] module which provides a templating system for
  Twisted web servers.  In outline, woven provides a programming
  style similar to PHP, ColdFusion, JSP, but arguably with a more
  useful division between code and templates than those other
  systems offer (and of course, [twisted.web.woven] lets you
  program in Python).  If we can fit it in, we will look also
  address dynamic pages and web security.
