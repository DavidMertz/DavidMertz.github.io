<h1>Xml Matters #10</h1>
<h2>An Indexer for XML Documents</h2>

    As XML becomes popular as a document storage format,
    especially for prose-oriented documents, the task of locating
    contents within XML document collections becomes more
    difficult.  This column extends the generic full text indexer
    presented in David's <cite>Charming Python #15</cite> to include
    XML-specific search and indexing features.  Discussions of
    how indexing can take advantage of the hierarchical node
    structure of XML is addressed in the tool design and in the
    discussion.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  In a technical sense, XML is a simplification and
  specialization of SGML.  At a first approximation, XML
  documents should also be valid SGML documents.  SGML, in turn,
  has been used extensively for large-scale documents, in both
  corporate and government circles.  One is likely to come across
  multi-thousand page, multi-megabyte, documents for, e.g.
  product specifications, regulatory requirements, and computer
  system documentation in SGML formats.
</p>
<p>
  Culturally, however, XML has evolved from a different
  direction.  In one respect, XML is a successor for EDI; in
  another respect, a successor for HTML.  But having a different
  cultural history than SGML, XML is undergoing its own process
  of tool development.  And at the same time, as XML is becoming
  more popular, expect to see more and more of both (usally)
  informal HTML documents and (usually) formal SGML documents to
  migrate in the direction of XML formats--particularly using XML
  dialects like DocBook.
</p>
<p>
  One tool that XML has not yet grown within its own culture is
  one to effectively and efficiently locate content within large
  XML documents, or within large collections of XML documents.
  General file-search tools like <code>grep</code> on Unix, and other
  similar tools on other platforms, are perfectly able to read
  the plain text of XML documents (modulo possible Unicode
  issues), but a simple <code>grep</code> search (or even a complicated one)
  miss the <em>structure</em> of XML documents.
</p>
<p>
  If files contain thousands of pages of documentation, just
  determining that a given file contains a word, phrase, or
  regular expression only very loosely targets what you are
  likely to know when searching for content in them.  Just which
  of those agriculture reports, for example, was written by Ms.
  June Apple?  One imagines a coarse tool like <code>grep</code> would tend
  to find a lot of things that are not the ones of interest.
  Moreover, ad hoc tools like <code>grep</code>, while very efficient at
  what they do, need to check the entire contents of large files
  each time a search is performed.  For frequent searches,
  repeated full-file searching is inefficient.
</p>
<h3>Extending <em><code>indexer</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  In response to the need outlined above, I have created the
  public-domain utility <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em>.  This Python module can
  both be used as a runtime utility and also easily extended by
  custom applications that use its services.  <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em>, in
  turn, relies on the services of two earlier public-domain
  utilities I have written about in IBM developerWorks articles:
  <em><code>indexer</code></em> and <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> (see Resources).
</p>
<p>
  The "trick" <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em> uses is the same one XPATH uses.
  Rather than treat XML documents as simply <em>things</em> in the
  filesystem, we can pretend that the hierarchical nodes of an
  XML document themselves look much like a hierarchical
  filesystem.  For purposes of indexing, other than a need for a
  little syntax to distinguish an XPATH from a filesystem path,
  we can simply treat an XML node as if it were itself a text
  file.  Fortunately, <em><code>indexer</code></em> was designed with enough
  flexibility to use arbitrary identifiers in indexing texts.
  Let's look at some search results:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Indexed search against XML nodes</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer ibm
/articles/tutor/cryptology3.xml::/section[1]/panel[2]/body/text_column/p[1]
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr2.xml::/person[4]/contact_info/email/@address
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr2.xml::/person[2]/contact_info/email/@address
/tools/addr2.xml::/person[4]/contact_info/email/@address
/tools/addr2.xml::/person[2]/contact_info/email/@address

5 file matched wordlist: ['ibm']
Processed in 0.320 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)

</pre></div><p>
  As with XPATH, attribute values are preceded by an <code>@</code> mark,
  and sibling nodes are enumerated within square brackets.  The
  filesystem path to an XML document acts, in this context, like
  an XPATH axis--roughly as a namespace.  For comparison, let's
  peform a similar indexed search against a file database (some
  additional search terms are used to keep the result list
  reasonable):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Indexed search of email messages</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer ibm python xml indexer
D:\archive\mail\messages\tenco.cp15.2001-03-06.13+50+35
D:\archive\mail\messages\tenco.cp15.2001-03-01.07+57+26
D:\archive\mail\messages\tenco.cp15.2001-02-28.23+25+26

3 file matched wordlist: ['ibm', 'python', 'xml', 'indexer']
Processed in 2.530 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)

</pre></div><p>
  While the first search is against a fairly trivial amount of
  test data, the second search uses a "production" index against
  about 100MB of archived email messages (stored in the
  filesystem, one message per file).  Taking just a couple
  seconds to search 100MB of files (for multiple simultaneous
  word occurrences) is quite fast, methinks.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, while these searches utilize different index
  databases (because they were done during a testing stage of
  <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em>), there is no reason that a compound index of
  text files and XML nodes cannot be created.  In such a case, it
  is even possible (and probably often useful) to index each XML
  file <em>both</em> as a collection of nodes and as a plain file.
  After doing so, search results will show both types of
  identifier, with the filesystem identifier obviously occurring
  in every case that an XPATH in its namespace does.  For
  example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Indexed search of email messages</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer actresses
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr_break.xml
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr_break.xml::/person[3]/misc_info

2 file matched wordlist: ['actresses']
Processed in 0.070 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)


</pre></div><h3>Creating Indices</h3>
 <p>
  In the above examples, readers will have noticed that in the
  examples <code>indexer</code> was used to perform searches, with no
  mention of <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em>.  This is because the very same index
  search tool is used for searching index databases created by
  <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em> as for those create by <em><code>indexer</code></em>.  In fact
  <code>indexer</code> is simply a call to <code>python indexer.py ...</code> with the
  command-line arguments passed in an OS-appropriate manner.
  Creating or enhancing text-file indexes is also performed by
  <code>indexer</code>--run <code>indexer --help</code> or <code>indexer /?</code> to get a
  breakdown on the needed arguments and switches.  You can
  recurse across directories when you add files to an index, and
  also limited filename patterns in various ways.
</p>
<p>
  At least for now, XML-node index databases are created using
  the simpler <code>xml_indexer.py</code> script.  As of this writing, just
  a single XML document's nodes are added to an index database
  at a time, by specifying its name as a command-line argument.
  However, by the time you read this, the command-line syntax for
  <code>xml_indexer.py</code> will probably be enhanced to look more like
  that for <code>indexer.py</code>.  Take a look at the output of
  <code>python xml_indexer.py --help</code> before using it.
</p>
<h3>Specifying Xpaths</h3>
 <p>
  In order to give search results XPATH wildcard capabilities, a
  <code>-filter</code> option has been added to <em><code>indexer</code></em>.  XPATH functions,
  however, are not currently supported in search results.  As a
  transparent, and beneficial, side-effect, this same switch can
  be used for filename globbing--just in case you are only
  interested in matching files fulfilling some patterns.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, the <code>/filter</code> option works exactly as you might
  expect (adjust for different quoting syntax across shells).
  You can specify that you are only interested in XPATH results
  using the double colon in the filter.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Only return XPATH search results</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer "/filter=*::*" actresses
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr_break.xml::/person[3]/misc_info

1 file matched wordlist: ['actresses']
Processed in 0.050 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)
</pre></div><h3></h3>
 <div class="code-sample"><h4>Only return XML document as file</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer "/filter=*.xml" actresses
/temp/Benchmark/Data/addr_break.xml

1 file matched wordlist: ['actresses']
Processed in 0.050 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)

</pre></div><p>
  More complicated XPATH specifiers are possible by specifying
  the subelements and order required:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Show all the word matches in index</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer symmetric
/tutor/cryptology1.xml::/section[2]/panel[8]/title
/tutor/cryptology1.xml::/section[2]/panel[8]/body/text_column/code_listing

 <div class="code-sample"><h4>Limit matches to ones in a title element</h4><pre>
[D:\articles] indexer "-filter=*::/*/title" symmetric
/tutor/cryptology1.xml::/section[2]/panel[8]/title
/tutor/cryptology1.xml::/section[2]/panel[7]/title

2 file matched wordlist: ['symmetric']
Processed in 0.080 seconds (SlicedZPickleIndexer)


</pre></div><h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  It turned out that the design of <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em> was aided
  enormously by the object-oriented design principles that went
  into <em><code>indexer</code></em> before it.  With the overriding of just a few
  methods in the <code>GenericIndexer</code> class (actually, in its
  descendent <code>SlicedPickleIndexer</code>--but one could just as easily
  mix in any concrete Indexer class), the use of an entirely new
  set of identifiers and data source was possible.
</p>
<p>
  Readers who wish to use <em><code>xml_indexer</code></em> as part of their own
  larger Python projects should find its further specialization
  equally simple.  I look forward to seeing the uses readers are
  able to put these helpful base index classes to.

  In order to easily descend recursively through XML nodes, I
  utilized the high-level Pythonic interface provided by
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>.  However, it should be noted that until
  recently, this option would not have been practical.  Older
  versions of <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> used DOM to read XML files, which
  proves embarassingly slow for large XML documents (part of the
  blame is on the way <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> handles this DOM).  Costas
  Malamas has provided an alternative parsing method that uses
  the <code>expat</code> parser and stream-oriented techniques.  This new
  technique still has a few hickups with some complicated XML
  documents, but in most cases works fine, and multiple orders of
  magnitude faster.  You can find <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> at:
