<p><strong class="subhead">What Is Htmlpp?</strong></p>
 <p>  HTMLPP is a text "preprocessor" written in Perl.  A
  preprocessor is a great thing to use when you want to generate
  a site worth of consistent-looking pages.  Rather than having
  to copy-and-paste things like navigation bars, site-titles,
  color and background definitions, with a preprocessor you can
  give a simple name to a whole batch of HTML; and changing it in
  one place will change it everywhere.
</p>
<p>  What a preprocessor actually does is read a source file that
  consists of some literal text with some directives, and create
  output according to the directives.  HTMLPP directives can be
  variable insertions, or one of the "intrinsic functions", or
  even Perl program fragments.
</p>
<h3>HTMLPP versus PPWizard

</h3> <p>  For Webreview readers who happened to see my review of PPWizard
  (http://webreview.com/pace/print/2000/06/30/feature/index03.html),
  my description of HTMLPP will sound awfully familiar.  HTMLPP
  and PPWizard exist to fill nearly the same niche, and in many
  ways, what they both do is dictated by the niche.  You might be
  tempted to decide between the two tools based just on you
  familiarity with Perl (HTMLPP) versus REXX (PPWizard), but I
  find that there are much more important differences between the
  tools than this.  In using either tool, you will probably use
  the high-level macros more than you will the underlying
  scripting language; and either scripting language allows
  friendly ways of expressing program constructs.
</p>
<p>  In my PPWizard review, I contrasted a preprocessor with
  server-side includes and with server-side scripting.  Those
  remarks apply just as well to HTMLPP as they did to PPWizard,
  so I will not repeat them here.
</p>
<p>  What is more interesting to look at is the difference in design
  philosophy of HTMLPP and PPWizard.  One thing that stands out
  is that PPWizard is most facile at building up complex HTML
  documents from multiple templates and data sources.  HTMLPP, on
  the other hand, is much more focussed on breaking down complex
  source documents into simpler groups of HTML pages (such as
  chapters of a document).  Because of this differing focus, if
  your source is <strong>documents</strong> in a traditional book/journal/manual
  sense, HTMLPP is likely to serve you better.  For that sort of
  thing, HTMLPP syntax feels more natural, and less intrusive.
  In futher support of the document model, HTMLPP offers a basic degree of
  multilingual support with a language directive (and language
  template files), along with simple table-of-contents
  directives.  On the other hand, if you do not have a "source"
  in this documentary sense, but are building complex HTML "whole
  cloth", PPWizard is probably a better choice.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Intrinsic Functions</strong></p>
 <p>  HTMLPP can call any Perl code that can be wrapped in an <code>eval</code>
  call.  But most of the time it is easier to use one of the
  functions that HTMLPP provides for you.  You don't necessarily
  have to be a Perl programmer to use HTMLPP intrinsic functions;
  you are less likely to make a programming error; and the syntax
  flows a little more naturally.  Intrinsic functions include a
  number of functions for getting and calculating dates, some
  simple text transformation functions (like upper()), some
  functions to check on files, and quite usefully some functions
  to check image sizes.  The results of these functions will
  normally be written into resultant HTML pages.
</p>
<p>  While HTMLPP has some of the most useful built-in functions you
  might think of, PPWizard simply has a lot more functions in it.
  Partially this is probably because PPWizard seems to be more
  actively maintained, but part is also because of PPWizards
  greater focus on complex conditional processing.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Guru Mode</strong></p>
 <p>  In keeping with its focus on source documents, HTMLPP has a
  nice trick that PPWizard lacks (except in very rudimentary
  form).  In the "guru mode", HTMLPP can process source files
  with no apparent markup at all.  Guru mode looks for some
  features of text that look good as plain ASCII, and converts
  them to what it thinks is proper HTML.  For example, headers
  (H1, H2, H3, respectively) should look like:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>Chapter Header
**************

Section Header
==============

Subsection Header
-----------------

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Some other formatting conventions allow you to indicate
  bullets, numbered lists, tables, images, and a few other
  things.  As an unobtrusize way to prepare documents, these few
  "invisible" markup conventions are quite easy to learn and use.
  On this line, you also might find useful a utility I wrote that
  serves a similar purpose, called Txt2Html; find it at,
  &lt<a href="http://gnosis.cx/cgi/txt2html.cgi&gt;.">http://gnosis.cx/cgi/txt2html.cgi&gt;.</a>  Txt2Html doesn't deal
  with quite as many formatting features as HTMLPP does, but it
  does a number of other things HTMLPP does not (and it is also
  free).
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Overall</strong></p>
 <p>  HTMLPP is a very quick way to get started with preprocessing,
  and all the site-development benefits that provides.  Guru mode
  is good mojo; and even the full markup feels very light and
  comfortable to work with.  For more powerful processing,
  PPWizard is a good step up, but either tool can be made to do
  whatever you want with a little work.  After using tools like
  these, I can hardly imagine going back to trying to maintain
  consistent HTML pages through endless cutting-and-pasting.  A
  preprocessor is a great way to save yourself some work.
