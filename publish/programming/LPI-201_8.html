<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)
</p>
<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Troubleshooting", the eighth of eight tutorials designed
  to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In large part this tutorial
  reiterates material already covered in more detail in earlier
  tutorials, but with an eye to "what to do when things go wrong?"
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About troubleshooting
</h3>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, troubleshooting a Linux system that is not working--or
  more especially, is not <strong>entirely</strong> working--is probably the most
  frustrating parts of system administration.  Linux is not special in
  this regard, the same can be said of any operating system or other
  complex software system.  It is relatively straightforward, most of
  the time, to add new hardware or software, tweak the behavior of
  installed software, or script and schedule routine operations.  But
  when a running system suddenly doesn't, a system administrator is
  presented with a dizzying collection of things that <strong>might</strong> be wrong.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial cannot solve many real world problems.  That takes a
  good understanding of Linux overall, combined with even more patience
  and elbow grease.  But we will point to tools that are helpful in the
</p>

</pre></div><p>
  remind readers of some of the best places to look for sources of
  trouble.
</p>
<h3>Creating Recovery Disks</h3>
 <h3>Before you recover
</h3>
 <p>
  When, in course of system events, a Linux installation gets so messed
  up that it just cannot boot normally, a good first course of action is
  to attempt to "boot single-user" to fix the problem.  Single user mode
  (runlevel 1) allows you to access and modify many problems without
  worrying about permission issues or files being locked by other users
  and processes.  Moreover, single user mode runs with a minimum of
  services, daemons and tasks that might confound--or even be the cause
  of--your underlying problem.
</p>
<p>
  In some cases, however, even files needed for single user mode such as
  <code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/etc/fstab</code>, <code>/etc/inittab</code>, <code>/sbin/init</code>,
  <code>/dev/console</code>, etc. can become corrupted, and the system will not
  boot, even into single-user mode. In times like this, a recovery disk
  (a bootable disk which contains the essentials needed to repair a
  broken partition, sometimes called a <code>repair disk</code>) can be used to get
  the system back on its feet.
</p>
<h3>Recovery CDs
</h3>
 <p>
  Nowadays, standalone CD (or DVD) distributions such as Knoppix can be
  used as "Cadillac" recovery disks, sporting a vast array of drivers,
  debugging tools, and even a web browser. Even if you have special
  needs such as unusual drivers (e.g. kernel modules) or recovery
  software, you are usually best off downloading a Linux Live-CD like
  Knoppix, and customizing the contents of the ISO image before burning
  a recovery disk. See the tutorial for Topic 203 for information on
  loop mounting an ISO image. You may obtain and read about Knoppix at
 <a href="http://www.knoppix.org/.">http://www.knoppix.org/.</a>
</p>
<h3>Recovery Floppies
</h3>
 <p>
  For very old systems without bootable CD-ROMs, floppies containing
  only the bare essentials have to be used for recovery. Niceties like
  <code>emacs</code> and <code>vim</code> are typically too bulky to fit on a single recovery
  floppy, so an experienced system administrator should be prepaired to
  use a striped down editor like <code>ed</code> to fix corrupted configuration
  files.
</p>
<p>
  To create custom boot floppies, reader should read the Linux
  Documentation Project's "Linux-Bootdisk HOWTO." In many cases,
  however, Linux distributions will offer to create a recovery diskettes
  at installation time, or later using included tools. Be sure to create
  and store recover disks <strong>before</strong> you really need them!
</p>
<h3>Identifying Boot Stages</h3>
 <h3>About booting
</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial on Topic 202 contains much more extensive information
  about Linux boot sequences. We will review the stages in quick summary
  for this tutorial
</p>
<p>
  The first stage of bootup has changed little since IBM compatible PC's
  with harddisks where first introduced. The BIOS reads the first sector
  of the boot disk into memory and runs it. This 512 byte Master Boot
  Record (MBR), which also stores the fdisk label, turns around and
  loads the "OS loader" (either GRUB or LILO) from the "active"
  partition.
</p>
<h3>Booting the kernel
</h3>
 <p>
  Once the system BIOS (on an x86 system, other architectures vary
  slightly) runs the MBR, several steps happen for the Linux kernel to
  load.  If boot does not succeed, determining where it fails is the
  first step in figuring out what needs to be fixed.
</p>
<p>
  * Load Boot Loader (LILO/Grub)
</p>
<p>
  * Boot loader starts and hands off control to kernel
</p>
<p>
  * Kernel: Load base kernel and other essential kernel modules.
</p>
<p>
  * Hardware initializiation and setup
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em> Kernel starts
    </em> Initialize kernel infrastructure (VM, scheduler, etc)
    <em> Device Drivers Probe and Attach
    </em> Root filesystem mounted
</blockquote>
<h3>Booting the userland
</h3>
 <p>
  Assuming a base kernel, kernel modules, and root filesystem start
  successfully (or at least successfully enough not to freeze
  completely), the system initialization process starts:
</p>
<p>
  * daemon initialization and setup
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em> /sbin/init started as process 1.
    </em> /sbin/init reads /etc/inittab
    <em> /etc/rc&lt;n&gt;.d/S* scripts are run by /etc/init.d/rc
    </em> disks fsck'ed
    <em> network interfaces configured
    </em> daemons started
    - getty(s) started on console and serial ports
</blockquote>
<h3>Troubleshooting Lilo And Grub</h3>
 <h3>Looking for the boot loader
</h3>
 <p>
  When Grub starts up it flashes "GRUB loading, please wait..." on the
  screen and then jumps into its boot menu. LILO usually displays a
  <code>LILO:</code> prompt (but some versions jump directly to a menu). If you do
  not reach a LILO or GRUB screen, it is probably time for a separate
  recovery disk. Generally, you will know you have this problem with
  some kind of BIOS message about not finding a boot sector, or maybe
  even not finding a harddisk at all.
</p>
<p>
  If your system cannot locate a usable boot sector, it is possible that
  your LILO or GRUB installation became corrupted. Sometimes other
  operating systems step on boot sectors (or overzealous "virus
  protection programs" on Windows), and occasionally other problems
  arise. A recovery disk will let you reinstall LILO or GRUB. Typically
  you will want to <code>chroot</code> to your old root filesystem to utilize your
  prior LILO or GRUB configuration files.
</p>
<p>
  In the hardisk-not-found case, hardware failure is likely (and you
  will hope you made a backup); often in the no-boot-sector case too.
  See the tutorial on Topic 202 for more information on LILO and GRUB.
</p>
<h3>Configuring LILO and GRUB
</h3>
 <p>
  LILO is configured with the file <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code>, or by another
  configuration file specified at the command line.  To reinstall LILO,
  first make sure your <code>lilo.conf</code> file really matches your current
  system configuration (the right partition and disk number information
  especially; this can become mixed up if you swap harddisk and/or
  change partitions).  Once you have verified your configuration, simply
  run <code>/sbin/lilo</code> as root (or in single user mode).
</p>
<p>
  Configuring and reinstalling GRUB is essentially the same process as
  for LILO.   GRUB's configuration file is <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code>, but it
  is read each time the system boots.  Likewise, the GRUB shell live at
  <code>/boot/grub/</code>, but you can choose which harddisk the basic GRUB MBR
  lives at with the <code>groot=</code> option in <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code>.  To
  install GRUB to an MBR, run a command like <code>grub-install /dev/hda</code>,
  which will check the currently mounted <code>/boot/</code> for its configuration.
</p>
<h3>General Troubleshooting</h3>
 <h3>The Linux filesystem structure
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux distributions vary a bit in where they put files.  The Linux
  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is making progress in furthering
  standardization of this.  A few standard directories are already well
  standardized, and are particularly important to look at for startup
  and runtime problems:
</p>
<p>
  * /proc/ - This is the virtual filesystem where information on
</p>
<blockquote>
    processes and system status.  All the guts of a running system live
    here, in a sense.  See Topic 201 for more information.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * /var/log/ - Log files live here.  If something goes wrong, changes
</p>
<blockquote>
    are good that helpful information is in some log file here.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * / - Generally the root of the filesystem under Linux simply contains
</p>
<blockquote>
    other nested directories.  On some systems bootup files like
    <code>vmlinuz</code> and <code>initrd.img</code> might be here rather than in <code>/boot/</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * /boot/ - Files directly used in the kernel boot process.
</p>
<p>
  * /lib/modules/ - Kernel modules live nested under this directory, in
</p>
<blockquote>
    subdirectories named for the current kernel version (if you boot
    multiple kernel versions, multiple directories should exist).  For
    example:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      % ls /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/
      arch  crypto  drivers  fs  lib  net  security  sound
</blockquote>
<h3>Finding bootup messages
</h3>
 <p>
  During actual system boot, messages can scroll by quickly, and you may
  not have time to identify problems or unexpected initialization
  activities.  Some information of interest is likely to be logged with
  <code>syslog</code>, but the basic kernel and kernel module messages can be
  examined with the tool <code>dmesg</code>.
</p>
<h3>Hardware/system identification tools
</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial for Topic 203 (Hardware) contains more information on
  hardware identification.  Generally, you should keep in mind these
  system tools:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> lspci: List all PCI devices
  </strong> lsmod: List loaded kernel modules
  <strong> lsusb: List USB devices
  </strong> lspnp: List Plug-and-Play devices
  * lshw: List hardware
</p>
<p>
  Slightly farther from hardware, but still useful:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> lsof: List open files
  </strong> insmod: Load kernel module
  <strong> rmmod: Remove kernel module
  </strong> modprobe: Higher level insmod/rmmod/lsmod wrapper
  <strong> uname: Print system information (kernel version, etc)
  </strong> strace: Trace system calls
</p>
<p>
  When you get desperate in trying to use binaries, whether libraries or
  applications, the tool <code>strings</code> can really rescue you (but expect to
  work at it).  Crucial information like hardcoded paths are sometimes
  buried in binaries, and with a good measure of trial-and-error, you
  can find them by looking for the <code>strings</code> within binaries.
</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting System Resources And Environment</h3>
 <h3>The initialization
</h3>
 <p>
  As Topic 202 addresses in more detail, the startup of Linux, after the
  kernel loads, is controlled by the <code>init</code> process.  The main
  controlling configuration for <code>init</code> is <code>/etc/inittab</code>.  The
  <code>/etc/inittab</code>  contains details on what steps to peform at each
  runlevel.  But perhaps the most crucial thing it does is actually set
  the runlevel for later actions.  If your system is having troubles
  booting, a setting a different runlevel may help the process.  The key
  line is something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># The default runlevel. (in /etc/inittab)
id:2:initdefault:

</pre></div><h3>Resource scripts
</h3>
 <p>
  The rc scripts run at boot time, shutdown time, and whenever the
  system changes runlevels and are responsible for starting and stoping
  the most system daemons. In most (i.e. modern) Linux distributions,
  the rc scripts live in the directory <code>/etc/init.d/</code> and are linked to
  the directories <code>/etc/rc&lt;N&gt;.d/</code> (for N=runlevel) where they are named
  <code>S*</code> for startup scripts and <code>K*</code> for shutdown scripts. The system
  never runs the scripts from <code>/etc/init.d</code> directly, but looks for them
  in <code>/etc/rc&lt;N&gt;.d/[SK]*</code>.
</p>
<h3>The system shell
</h3>
 <p>
  Rarely, but conceivably, a system administrator may wish to change the
  system wide shell startup script <code>/etc/profile</code>. Such a change affects
  every interactive shell (except for <code>/bin/tcsh</code> users or other
  non-'/bin/sh' compatible shells). Corrupting this file can easily lead
  to a situation where no one can login, and a recovery disk may be
  needed to rectify the situation. The normal method of changing shell
  behavior on an individual basis is by modifying
  <code>/home/$USER/.bash_profile</code> and <code>/home/$USER/.bashrc</code>.
</p>
<h3>Configure kernel parameters
</h3>
 <p>
  The <code>sysctl</code> system (see the manpage for <code>sysctl</code>) was taken from BSD
  Unix and is be used to tune some system resources. Run <code>sysctl -a</code> to
  see what variables can be controlled by <code>sysctl</code> and what they are set
  to. The <code>sysctl</code> utility is most useful to tuning networking
  parameters as well as some kernel parameters. Use the file
  <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> set <code>sysctl</code> parameters at boot time.
</p>
<h3>Dynamic libraries
</h3>
 <p>
  On most systems, dynamic libraries are constantly being added,
  updated, replaced and removed. Since almost every program on the
  system needs to find and load dynamic libraries, the names version
  numbers and locations of most dynamic libraries are cached by the
  <code>ldconfig</code> program. Normally only the dynamic libraries in the system
  directories <code>/lib/</code> and <code>/usr/lib/</code> are cached. To add more
  directories to the system wide default search path, add the directory
  names (such as <code>/usr/X11R6/lib</code>) to the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> and run
  <code>ldconfig</code> as root.
</p>
<h3>System logging
</h3>
 <p>
  Topic 211 discusses <code>syslog</code> in detail.  The key file to keep in mind
  if you have problems (and especially if you want to make sure you can
  analyze them later), is <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code>.  By changing the contents
  of this configuration, you have fine-tuned control over what events
  are logged, and where they are logged--including potentially via mail
  or remote machines.  If problems occur, make sure the subsystems where
  you think they arise log information in a manner you can readily
  examine forensically.
</p>
<h3>Periodic events
</h3>
 <p>
  On almost every Linux system, the <code>cron</code> daemon is running.  See Topic
  213 for more details on <code>cron</code> and <code>crontab</code>.  In general a source of
  potential problems to keep in mind is scripts that are run
  intermittently.  It is possible that what you believe to be a kernel
  or application issue results from unrelated scripts that are run
  behind the scenes by <code>cron</code>.
</p>
<p>
  An extreme measure is to kill <code>cron</code> altogether.  You can find its
  process nubmer with <code>ps ax | grep cron</code>, and <code>kill</code> can terminate it.
  A less drastic measure is to edit <code>/etc/crontab</code> to run a more
  conservative collection of tasks; also be sure to contrain the user
  tasks that are scheduled by editing <code>/etc/cron.allow</code> and
  <code>/etc/cron.deny</code>.  Even though users usually should not have enough
  permissions to cause system-wide problems, a good first step is to
  temporarily disable user <code>crontab</code> configurations, and see if that
  resolves problems.
