    This column continues the discussion of DocBook begun in <cite>XML
    Matters #3</cite>.  In this column we will look at some DocBook tags
    in greater detail, and also look at the actual composition of
    DocBook documents.  In the next column, we will examine ways
    to transform DocBook documents to other formats using XLST
    (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)..

<h3>What Is Xml? What Is Docbook?</h3>
 <p>
  XML is a simplified dialect of the Standard Generalized Markup
  Language (SGML).  Many readers will be most familiar with SGML
  via one particular document type, HTML.  XML documents are
  similar to HTML in being composed of text interspersed with and
  structured by markup tags in angle-brackets.  But XML
  encompasses many systems of tags that allow XML documents to be
  used for many purposes:  magazine articles and user
  documentation, files of structured data (like CSV or EDI
  files), messages for interprocess communication between
  programs, architectural diagrams (like CAD formats), and many
  other purposes.  A set of tags can be created to capture any
  sort of structured information one might want to represent,
  which is why XML is growing in popularity as a common standard
  for representing diverse information.
</p>
<p>
  DocBook is an SGML dialect developed by O'Reilly and HaL
  Computer Systems in 1991.  It is currently maintained by the
  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
  Standards (OASIS).  The purpose of DocBook is to describe the
  content of articles, books, technical manuals, and other prose
  documents.  DocBook has a focus on technical writing styles,
  but is general enough to describe everything that goes into
  most styles of prose writing.  An XML variant of the DocBook
  DTD is also available (and is the one that will be discussed in
  this article, inasmuch as small details differ).
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  DocBook is a rather complicated DTD with hundreds of elements.
  Few people will be familiar with all the elements of DocBook;
  but fortunately, there is really no need to know all of DocBook
  in order to work with it productively.  The basic elements are
  arranged in a logical way, and most elements follow the similar
  patterns for nesting of child elements.
</p>
<p>
  The key to working with DocBook is having a good reference
  handy while you are working.  I am personally partial to using
  a written text (which now means O'Reilly's excellent text, see
  Resources), but the identical material is also available online
  (see Resources).  There are two general approaches to creating
  DocBook content (I have played with both in the process of
  working on these columns): use a specialized XML editor, or use
  a generic text editor plus an external validator.  The main
  thing is that DocBook is detailed enough that you will need
  some automation in assuring conformance to the DTD; it is easy
  to make small typos.  You can, of course work for stretches and
  validate only occassionally (fixing minor glitches should not
  take long).
</p>
<p>
  If you decide to use a specialized XML editor, you will
  probably be presented with some assistance in entering elements
  and attributes.  Many of these programs provide context
  sensitive prompts for available (sub-)tags, or at least lists
  of tags that exist in the current (DocBook) DTD.  On the down
  side though, specialized editors are generally less flexible in
  other ways than good general purpose text editors.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the quality of tools available for working with
  XML is still disappointing (at least to me).  I have tested a
  fairly large number of XML validation and transformation tools,
  and almost all of them fail in some respects when trying to
  work with DocBook.  Specifically, I have yet to locate a wholly
  accurate command-line XML validator (reader suggestions are
  greatly welcomed).  What I have settled for as good-enough is
  using XML Spy under Win32 (see Resources for my review of this
  product), and Xeena under other (Java-supporting) platforms.
  Both of these do a good job of validation, although with more
  overhead than should really be necessary.  Hopefully, these
  matters will improve over time.
</p>
<h3>Elements</h3>
 <p>
  The first thing to do in preparing an XML DocBook document is
  to prepare its declaration.  We already saw a couple examples
  of this in the previous column, but without explanation of what
  was going on.  Let us look at a document template, and see what
  is going on with it:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE chapter PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
                  "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd" [
   &lt;!ENTITY Zizek "&amp;Zcaron;i&amp;zcaron;ek"&gt;
   &lt;!ENTITY Mocnik "Mo&amp;ccaron;nik"&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="chapter.xsl"?&gt;
&lt;chapter&gt;
   &lt;!-- The actual chapter contents are here --&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  The very first thing that occurs is the <code>&lt;?xml&gt;</code> declaration <em></em>
  this is just there to show that the document is XML.  The next
  thing we include is the document type declaration (that is, the
  <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> tag).  It is worth looking in some detail at what
  makes up the document type declaration.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing to notice in the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> tag is that it
  includes immediately the name of the root element that will be
  used in this specific document.  It is an important decision
  what type of root element to use <em></em> basically it says what
  purpose this document will serve, at least in broad terms.  The
  choice of root element generally determines the rough size of
  the document in question.  At the broadest scale, a declaration
  might be for a <code>set</code>, which includes two or more <code>book's.  Use
  this if what is intended is a whole reference collection, or
  the like (notice that we will not necessarily put everything in
  the same <em>file</em> though, we might use inclusions, as sketched in
  the previous column).  More likely, you will be creating a
  'book</code>, which is a collection of <code>part's or 'chapter's
  (plus some other bits at the same conceptual level as
  chapters/parts).  Or even more modestly, you might be creating
  a 'chapter</code> or an <code>article</code>.  That is what we are working on, a
  chapter.  In practice, a <code>chapter</code> or <code>article</code> is the smallest
  conceptual part used for a DocBook document.
</p>
<p>
  Continuing with the "attributes" of the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>
  declaration, we next see the PUBLIC identifier and the system
  identifier.  The part that comes after the word PUBLIC is an
  SGML feature, and you do not really need to use it in XML
  documents.  But if you <em>do</em> include it, be sure to spell it in
  exactly the way indicated in the actual DTD.  The actual DTD is
  indicated in the system identifier as a URL.  That is where all
  the actual DocBook definitions live (go ahead and download the
  URL, if you'd like to look at it; it references a number of
  other files in the same domain).  Spell this right also, or
  else your validating programs won't be able to find the DTD.
</p>
<p>
  Inside the square brackets in the '&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag is the
  "internal subset." This is an odd name, but all it amounts to
  is a way to declare some special features of your specific
  document.  In this case, we create a couple aliases for names
  that are hard to type on a US keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  After the document type declaration tag, we have a processing
  instruction in our example.  This part is not really necessary,
  and we will not go into detail about XSLT until the next
  column.  But the idea here is very similar to that with
  cascading style sheets (CSS) for HTML documents.  We added a
  reference to an XSL document that contains some rules for how
  we plan on transforming the DocBook document.  A processing
  instruction like this is quite optional, even for a
  transformation tool (much as with CSS).  Depending on the tool
  used, you can generally specify a transformation using whatever
  XSLT you want.  Adding the processing instruction is just a
  polite suggestion about one way to do it.
</p>
<p>
  The final bit is the root element mentioned.  We already
  effectively promised to use the <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> tag in the
  declaration, so we better follow our promise, and put it in.
  Everything the makes up the blood-and-guts of the chapter goes
  inside this root element.
</p>
<h3>Writing A Chapter</h3>
 <p>
  A <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> has a similar structure to an <code>&lt;appendix&gt;</code> or a
  <code>&lt;preface&gt;</code>.  An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is mostly the same structure also
  (the main difference is that the front-matter of an article is
  generally enclosed in an <code>&lt;artheader&gt;</code> element).  Things like
  chapters, articles, prefaces, bibliographies, and so on, are
  all kinds of "components" of documents.  That is to say, a
  component is something that addresses the same topic in a
  moderate specficity.  As with writing in general, judgement
  calls are necessary to decide just how close together ideas
  are.  But the words used for elements is a good for their
  English meanings.
</p>
<p>
  A component, in turn, has some front-matter, followed by some
  sections and/or block elements.  <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is usually required
  as front-matter for components, and also for sections.  Most
  other front-matter is optional, but might include author
  information, abstracts, graphics, or other information that has
  more to do with <em>describing</em> a component than really
  <em>constituting</em> the component.  Let's look at an example a
  valid, but hightly abridged, chapter (assume declarations as
  discussed):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;chapter&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Hegemony, and Other Passing Fads&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;epigraph&gt;
    &lt;attribution&gt;
      Gould, 1987b, quoting Gunnar Myrdal, &lt;citetitle&gt;An
      American Dilemma&lt;/citetitle&gt; (1944)
    &lt;/attribution&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;
      But there must be still other countless errors of the
      same sort that no living man can yet detect, because
      of the fog within which our type of Western culture
      envelops us.  Cultural influences have set up the
      assumptions about the mind, the body, and the
      universe with which we begin; pose the questions we
      ask; influence the facts we seek; determine the
      interpretations we give these facts; and direct our
      reaction to these interpretations and
      conclusions.
    &lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/epigraph&gt;

  &lt;sect1&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Day-Care Devil Worshipers&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- para's, sect2's, epigraph's, and other block elements --&gt;
  &lt;/sect1&gt;
  &lt;sect1&gt;
    &lt;!-- more blocks --&gt;
  &lt;/sect1&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  For a moderately large component, you will probably want to
  divide it into sections (as above).  But for a short component,
  you have the option of launching directly into block elements.
</p>
<p>
  Let us clarify what these things mean.  A block element is
  basically either a paragraph, or something at the same
  conceptual/hierarchical level as a paragraph (such as a list,
  and equation, an illustration, and so on).  The only thing
  "smaller" than a block element is an inline element.  Most
  usually, a block element will be set apart from other blocks
  with vertical whitespace, framing boxes, or the like; an inline
  element will be continuous with the words around it, but might
  be marked by a different font, color, hyperlink, or the like.
  As an example, in the above chapter, the epigraph is much like
  a short section.  It contains two blocks: the attribution, and
  the epigraph <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> (a different epigraph might be multiple
  paragraphs).  This atttibution contains a <code>&lt;citetitle&gt;</code>, but
  that citation will likely be rendered inline when printed,
  perhaps by italics or underlining.  Or maybe it will be a
  hotlink to the bibliography if rendered to HTML.
</p>
<p>
  Sections are bigger than blocks, and are in fact just a list of
  blocks.  How big they are is for authorial and editorial
  judgement.  But there are two main strategies for making
  sections.  You can either use the <code>&lt;sect1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;sect2&gt;</code>...
  <code>&lt;sect5&gt;</code> hierarchy, or you can use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element
  nested recursively.  For my own purpose--writing
  philosophical prose--I felt that explicitly numbered section
  levels was better.  I had a distinct sense of how important
  each type of section <em>must</em> be, and the numbering matched that
  well.  However, for something like a technical reference, you
  are more likely to consider that your material might be nested
  in different places and different depths appropriately.  In
  that case, the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element works better (and can nest
  to more than five levels).  There are some other specialized
  block types, but the above are the most general ones.
</p>
<h3>Until Next Time</h3>
 <p>
  The elements and structure outlined here is enough to get
  started on creating your own DocBook documents.  Take a look at
  those I created (see Resources) for some more details, or also
  check out the more extensive tag documentation in the
  Resources.  In the next column we will get around to
  transforming our DocBook source document into some other
  formats, and introduce extensible stylesheet language
  transformations (useful outside DocBook also).
