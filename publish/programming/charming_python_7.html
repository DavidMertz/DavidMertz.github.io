    One of the great advantages of Python over most other
    programming languages is the extreme runtime dynamism it is
    capable of.  As a consequence of having the handy <code>reload()</code>
    function, we can write programs that run persistently, but
    that load components that have been modified during the run
    of the process.  Pretty handy for services where continuous
    uptime is critical.  This column illustrates runtime program
    modification by means of some enhancements to the Txt2Html
    front-end discussed in an earlier column.  Specifically,
    our sample program will do a background check for new
    versions of the Txt2Html conversion library on the Internet,
    and download and reload any new version as needed without
    manual user intervention.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  Let us paint a scenario for this column:  Suppose you want to
  run a process on your local machine, but part of your program
  logic lives somewhere else.  Specifically, let us assume that
  this program logic is updated from time-to-time, and when you
  run your process, you would like to use the most current
  program logic.  There are a number of approaches to addressing
  the requirement just described; this column will walk a reader
  through several of them.
</p>
<p>
  As this column has progressed, I have discussed ongoing
  enhancements to my public-domain utility <code>Txt2Html</code>.  This
  utility converts "smart ASCII" text files to HTML.  Previous
  columns discussed the web-proxy version of the utility and a
  <code>curses</code> interface for the utility.  It also happens that from
  time-to-time I notice that some ASCII markup could be converted
  in a more useful way, or I fix a bug in handling a particular
  markup construct.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, these columns are written in ASCII, and converted
  during the editorial process to the HTML format you are
  probably reading.  Prior to sending a draft article off for
  publication, I run something like the following process:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Command-line HTMLization of articles</h4><pre>
txt2html charming_python_7.txt &gt; charming_python_7.html

</pre></div><p>
  If I wanted, I could specify some flags to modify the
  operation; but either way, I just rely on the fact that the
  most current version of the coverter is on my local drive and
  path.  If I were working on a different machine, or for readers
  who might want want to use the utility, the process is more
  cumbersome:  check my website, compare version numbers and
  filedates (sometimes I make a change too small to number),
  download the current version, copy current version to the right
  directory, run the command-line converter.
</p>
<p>
  There are several manual and moderately time consuming steps
  involved in the above.  It ought to be easier, and it can be.
</p>
<h3>Command-line Web Access</h3>
 <p>
  Most people think of the web as a way interactively to browse
  pages in a GUI environment.  Doing that is nice, of course.
  But there is also a lot of power in a command-line.  Systems
  with the text-mode web-browser <code>lynx</code> can largely treat the
  entire WWW as just another set of files for command-line tools
  to work with.  For example, some commands I find useful are:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Command-line web browsing with lynx</h4><pre>
lynx -dump http://gnosis.cx/publish/.
lynx -dump http://ibm.com/developer/. &gt; ibm_developer.txt
lynx -dump http://gnosis.cx/publish | wc | sed "s/( *[0-9]* *\)\([0-9]*\)\(.*\)/\2/g"

</pre></div><p>
  The first of these says "Display David Mertz' homepage to the
  console" (as ASCII text).  The second says, "Save an ASCII
  version of IBM's current developerWorks homepage to a file."
  The third example says "Display the number of words in David's
  homepage" (Don't worry about the specifics, it just shows
  command-line tools being combined with pipes).
</p>
<p>
  One thing about <code>lynx</code> is that (with the <code>-dump</code> option) it
  does almost exactly the opposite thing as <code>Txt2Html</code>:  the
  former converts HTML to text, and latter converts in the other
  direction.  But there is no reason not to be able to use
  <code>Txt2Html</code> in the same fashion as <code>lynx</code>.  Doing so can be
  accomplished with a short Python script:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'fetch_txt2html.py' command-line converter</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> sys
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> urllib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> urlopen, urlencode
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> len(sys.argv) == 2:
  cgi = <FONT COLOR=#115511>'http://gnosis.cx/cgi-bin/txt2html.cgi'</FONT>
  opts = urlencode({<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>:sys.argv[1], <FONT COLOR=#115511>'proxy'</FONT>:<FONT COLOR=#115511>'NONE'</FONT>})
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> urlopen(cgi, opts).read()
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Please specify URL for Txt2Html conversion"</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  To run this script, just do something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>python fetch_txt2html.py http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/charming_python_7.txt

</pre></div><p>
  This does not provide you with all the switches of local
  <code>Txt2Html</code> process, but it would be simple to add those if
  needed.  You can pipe and redirect the output just as you would
  with any command-line tool.  However, in the above version,
  you can only process data files that can be reached by URL, not
  local files.
</p>
<p>
  Actually, <code>fetch_txt2html.py</code> does something <code>lynx</code> does not
  (and neither does <code>Txt2Html</code> by itself):  it not only fetches
  the data source from a URL, it also gets the <strong>program logic</strong>
  remotely.  If you use <code>fetch_txt2html.py</code> there is no need to
  even <em>have</em> <code>Txt2Html</code> on your local machine; the processing is
  remotely invoked (with the latest version), and the results are
  sent back to you exactly as if you had run a local process.
  Neat, huh?  The local version of <code>Txt2Html</code> can access remote
  URLs just as with local files, but it cannot make sure it keeps
  itself up to date... yet!
</p>
<h3>Dynamic Initialization</h3>
 <p>
  Using <code>fetch_txt2html.py</code> assures that the latest program logic
  is always used in conversions.  Another thing this approach
  does, however, is move the processor (and memory) requirements
  onto the gnosis.cx webserver.  The load imposed by this
  particular process is not particularly high, but it is easy to
  imagine other types of processes where processing on the client
  is more efficient and desirable.
</p>
<p>
  The way <code>Txt2Html</code> is organized--like the way most programs are
  organized--is with a couple core flow-control functions
  assisted by a variety of utility functions.  In particular, the
  utility functions are the ones that I update fairly frequenty;
  the core functions (<code>main()</code> and a few others) will only be
  touched in the event of a major rewrite.  In short, what could
  helpfully be updated at each program run is the utility
  functions.  Most of the time, in fact, most of the functions
  will be fine in the main <code>Txt2Html</code> module <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em>.
</p>
<p>
  To reflect this organization, I have pulled out <em>copies</em> of all
  the text-manipulation utility functions into a support module
  called <em><code>d2h_textfuncs</code></em>.  The same functions still exist in the
  primary module, but the support module might contain more
  up-to-date versions of functions.  The <em><code>d2h_textfuncs</code></em> module
  is mostly a skeleton right now, but it might be filled in over
  time.  Most functions are merely commented headers, real
  updated program logic can be filled in as needed.  The support
  module looks like the below (abridged):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'d2h_textfuncs.py' dyanamic Txt2Html updates</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#115511>"""Hot-pluggable replacement functions for Txt2Html"""</FONT>

    txt = r.sub(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'\\1&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;\\2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;\\3'</FONT>,txt)
    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># *strongly emphasize* words</FONT>

    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> txt
<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># ... [more text transformation functions] ...</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  In order to utilize the support module in its latest-and-
  greatest incarnation, a few steps of preparation are necessary.
  First, download the main <code>Txt2Html</code> module to your local system
  (this is a one-time step).  Second, create a Python script on
  your local system that reads:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'dyn_txt2html.py' command-line converter</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> dmTxt2Html <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> *     <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Import the body of 'Txt2Html' code</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> urllib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> urlopen
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> sys

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Check for updated functions (fail gracefully if not fetchable)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>:
    updates = urlopen(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'http://gnosis.cx/download/t2h_textfuncs.py'</FONT>).read()
    fh = open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'t2h_textfuncs.py'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'w'</FONT>)
    fh.write(updates)
    fh.close()
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT>:
    sys.stderr.write(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'Cannot currently download Txt2Html updates'</FONT>)

<FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Import the updated functions (if available)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>:
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> t2h_textfuncs <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> *
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT>:
    sys.stderr.write(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'Cannot import the updated Txt2Html functions'</FONT>)

<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> len(sys.argv) == 2:
    cfg_dict = ParseArgs(sys.argv[1:])
    main(cfg_dict)
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Please specify URL (and options) for Txt2Html conversion"</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  A few comments are warranted concerning the <code>dyn_txt2html.py</code>
  script.  Notice that when the <code>from t2h_textfuncs import *</code>
  statement is executed, all the functions (like
  <code>Typographify()</code>) that were defined previously in <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em>
  are replaced by the <em><code>t2h_textfuncs</code></em> version of the same-named
  functions.  Of coure, where functions in <em><code>t2h_textfuncs</code></em> are
  only commented-out placeholders, no replacement occurs.
</p>
<p>
  One minor matter is that different systems handle
  writes to STDERR differently.  Under Unix-like systems, you can
  redirect STDERR when you run the script; however, under my
  current OS/2 shell, and under Windows/DOS, the STDERR messages
  will be appended to the console output.  You might want to
  either write the above errors/warning to a log file, or simply
  get in the habit of directing the STDOUT to a file (where it is
  probably more useful anyway.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Command-line session of 'dyn_txt2html'</h4><pre>
G:\txt2html&gt; python dyn_txt2html.py test.txt &gt; test.html
Cannot currently download Txt2Html updates

</pre></div><p>
  The error goes to console, the converted output to a file.
</p>
<p>
  A more interesting matter is why <code>dyn_txt2html.py</code> does not
  just download the whole <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> module instead of the
  support module only.  There are a few things going on here.
  The <em><code>t2h_textfuncs</code></em> support module is significantly smaller
  than the main <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> module, especially since most of the
  functions are stubbed/commented out.  On a modem connection
  this could be significantly faster.  But download size is not
  the main thing.
</p>
<p>
  For <code>Txt2Html</code> it probably does not matter if users
  auto-download the whole latest module.  But what about a system
  where the program logic is <strong>distributed</strong> <em></em> and especially
  where the responsibility for maintenance is distributed?  You
  might have Alice, Bob and Charlie be responsible for modules
  <em><code>Funcs_A</code></em>, <em><code>Funcs_B</code></em> and <em><code>Funcs_C</code></em>, respectively.  Each of them
  make periodic (and independent) changes to the functions under
  their control, and upload the latest-and-greatest to their own
  website (such as http://alice.com/Funcs_A.py).  In this
  scenario it is not feasable to have all three programmers make
  changes to the same main module.  But a script similar to
  <code>dyn_txt2html.py</code> can straightforwardly be extended to try
  importing <em><code>Funcs_A</code></em>, <em><code>Funcs_B</code></em> and <em><code>Funcs_C</code></em> all at startup
  (and fallback to <em><code>MainProg</code></em> version if these resources cannot
  be obtained).
</p>
<h3>A Long-running Dynamic Process</h3>
 <p>
  The tools we have looked at so far get their dynamic program
  logic by downloading updated resources at initialization.  This
  makes a lot of sense for command-line or batch processes, but
  what about long-running applications.  Such long-running
  applications are most likely to be server processes that
  respond to client requests continuously.  In our case, however,
  we will use the <code>curses_txt2html.py</code> script developed for a
  previous column to illustrate Python's <code>reload()</code> function.
  The program <code>curses_txt2html</code> is a wrapper for a local copy
  of <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em>.  Without trying to address <code>curses</code> programming
  a second time herein, it is enough to mention that
  <code>curses_txt2html</code> provides a set of interactive menus to
  configure and run multiple, sequential <code>Txt2Html</code> conversions.
</p>
<p>
  <code>curses_txt2html</code> could potentially be left running in the
  background all the time, and we would like it to be able to
  utilize up-to-date program logic when we switch to its session,
  and run a conversion.  For this specific simple example, it
  admittedly would not be difficult to close and relaunch the
  application, and no particular disadvantages would be incurred.
  But it is easy to imagine other processes that genuinely do
  depend on being left running all the time, perhaps ones that
  are stateful as to action performed in a session.
</p>
<p>
  For this column, a new File/Update submenu was added.  When
  activated, it simply calls a new function called
  <code>update_txt2html()</code>.  Aside from the <em><code>curses</code></em> calls that relate
  to providing some confirmation of what occurred, we have mostly
  already seen these steps in other examples in this column:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'curses_txt2html.py' dynamic update function</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="update_txt2html"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> update_txt2html</B></FONT></A>():
    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Check for updated functions (fail gracefully if not fetchable)</FONT>
    s = curses.newwin(6, 60, 4, 5)
    s.box()
    s.addstr(1, 2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"* PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE *"</FONT>, curses.A_BOLD)
    s.addstr(3, 2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"...downloading..."</FONT>)
    s.refresh()
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>:
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> urllib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> urlopen
        updates = urlopen(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'http://gnosis.cx/download/dmTxt2Html.py'</FONT>).read()
        fh = open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'dmTxt2Html.py'</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>'w'</FONT>)
        fh.write(updates)
        fh.close()
        s.addstr(3, 2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Module [dmTxt2Html] downloaded to current directory"</FONT>)
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT>:
        s.addstr(3, 2,  <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Download of updated [dmTxt2Html] module failed!"</FONT>)
    reload(dmTxt2Html)
    s.addstr(4, 2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Module [dmTxt2Html] reloaded from current directory  "</FONT>)
    s.refresh()
    c = s.getch()
    s.erase()</PRE></div><p>
  There are two significant differences between <code>dyn_txthtml.py</code>
  and our <code>update_txt2html()</code> function.  One is that we go ahead
  and import the main <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> module rather than just the
  support functions.  This is largely just to simplify the
  import.  The issue here is that we use an <code>import dmTxt2Html</code>
  to access the module instead of a <code>from dmTxt2Html import *</code>.
  In many ways this is a safer procedure, but a consequence is
  that it is more difficult to (accidentally or deliberately)
  overwrite functions in <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em>.  If we wanted to attach
  functions from <em><code>d2h_textfuncs</code></em> we would have to do a <code>dir()</code> on
  the imported support module, and attach members to the
  "dmTxt2Html" namespace in attribute fashion.  Doing this style
  of overwriting is left as an exercise for readers.
</p>
<p>
  The most significant difference introduced by the
  <code>update_txt2html()</code> function is the use of Python's built-in
  <code>reload()</code> function.  Just performing a brand new
  <code>import dmTxt2Html</code> will <strong>not</strong> overwrite the functions
  previously imported.  Watch out for this!  A lot of beginners
  assume that reimporting a module will update the version in
  memory.  It won't.  Instead, the way to update the in-memory
  image of the functions in a module is to <code>reload()</code> the module.
</p>
<p>
  There is another small trick performed above.  The download
  location of an updated <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> module is the local working
  directory, which may or may not be the directory where
  <em><code>dmTxt2Html</code></em> was originally loaded from.  In fact, if it is in
  the Python library directory, you probably will not be working
  there (and probably don't have permissions to it as a user).
  But the <code>reload()</code> call tries loading from the current
  directory first, then from the rest of Python's path.  So
  whether or not the download succeeds, the <code>reload()</code> should be
  a safe operation (it may or may not load anything new though).
