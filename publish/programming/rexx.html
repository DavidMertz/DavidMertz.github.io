    It is easy to get lost in the world of "little languages"--quite a
    few have been written to scratch some itch of a company, individual
    or project.  Rexx is one of these languages, with a long history of
    use on IBM OS's, and good current implementations for Linux and
    other Free Software operating systsems.  Moreover, David argues that
    Rexx occupies a useful ecological niche between the relative
    crudeness of shell scripting and the cumbersome formality of full
    systems languages.  Many Linux programmers and systems
    administrators would benefit from adding a Rexx implementation to
    their collection of go-to tools.

<h3>About Rexx</h3>
 <p>
  The Rexx programming language was first created in 1979, as a very
  high level scripting language that had a particularly strong facility
  for text processing tasks. Since Rexx's inception, IBM has included
  versions of Rexx with most of its operating systems--all the way from
  its mainframes, to its mid-level systems, to end user OS's like OS/2
  and PC-DOS. Other OS makers, such as Amiga, have also integrated Rexx
  as an always-available system scripting language. A number of ISVs,
  moreover, have created Rexx environments for many platforms. Somewhat
  late in the game, ANSI officially adopted a standard for Rexx in 1996.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays (especially on Linux or BSD-derived OS's), most of those
  older implementations of Rexx are primarily interesting as historical
  footnotes. However, two currently maintained implementations of Rexx
  remain available across a wide range of platforms, including Linux,
  MacOSX and Windows: Regina and NetRexx. Regina is a native executable,
  available as Free Software source code, or pre-compiled to a large
  number of platforms--install it pretty much as you would any other
  programming language interpreter.  NetRexx is an interesting hybrid.
  Much like Jython or Jacl, NetRexx compiles Rexx source code into Java
  bytecodes, and (optionally) runs the resulting <code>.class</code> file within
  a JVM.
</p>
<p>
  In capabilities and programming level, Rexx can be compared most
  closely to <code>bash</code> plus the GNU text utilities (throwing in <code>grep</code> and
  <code>sed</code> for good measure); or maybe to <code>awk</code> or Perl. Certainly Rexx has
  more of a quick-and-dirty feel to it than do, e.g., Python, Ruby, or
  Java. The verbosity--or rather, conciseness--of Rexx is similar to
  that of Perl, Python, Ruby or TCL. And Rexx is certainly
  Turing-complete, enables modules and structured programming, and has
  libraries for tasks such as GUI interfaces, network programming,
  database access. But its most natural target is in automation of
  system scripting and text processing tasks. As with shell scripting,
  Rexx allows very natural and transparent control of external
  application; but compared to <code>bash</code> (or <code>tcsh</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.), Rexx
  contains a much richer collection of built-in control structures and
  (text processing) functions.
</p>
<p>
  Stylistically, the IBM/mainframe roots of Rexx show in its case
  insensitive commands; and to a lesser degree in the relative sparcity
  of punctuation it uses (prefering keywords to symbols). I tend to find
  that these qualities aid readability; but this is mostly a matter of
  individual taste.
</p>
<h3>A Start At Streams And Stacks</h3>
 <p>
  As a simple conceit, let me present a number of versions of a very
  simple utility that lists files and numbers them. One feature that
  Rexx has in common with shell scripting is that it has a relatively
  impovershed collection of functions for working with the underlying
  operating system--mostly limited to the the ability to open, read, and
  modify files.  For most anything else, you rely on external utilities
  to perform the job at hand.  The utility <code>numbered-1.rexx</code> simply
  processes STDIN:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>numbered-1.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
DO i=1 UNTIL lines()==0
  PARSE LINEIN line
  IF line\="" THEN
    SAY i || ") " || line
END

</pre></div><p>
  The ubiquitous instruction <code>PARSE</code> can read from various sources. In
  this case, it puts the next line of STDIN into the variable <code>line</code>.
  We also check if a line is blank, and skip showing and numbering it
  if so. For example, combined with <code>ls</code> we can get:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>piping command to numbered-1</h4><pre>
$ ls | ./numbered-1.rexx
1) ls-1.rexx
2) ls-2.rexx
3) ls-3.rexx
4) ls-4.rexx
5) ls-5.rexx
6) ls-6.rexx
7) numbered-1.rexx
8) numbered-2.rexx

</pre></div><p>
  You can equally pipe any other command in.
</p>
<p>
  A concept at the core of Rexx is juggling multiple stacks/streams. In
  <code>bash</code>-like fashion, anything in Rexx that is not recognized as an
  internal instruction or function is assumed to be an external utility.
  There is no special function or syntax for calling an external
  command.  Taking advantage of the Regina utility, <code>rxqueue</code> that puts
  output onto the Rexx stack, we can write a "numbered ls" utility as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-1.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
"ls | rxqueue"
DO i=1 WHILE queued() \= 0
  PARSE PULL line
  SAY i || ") " || line
END

</pre></div><p>
  Some instructions in Rexx may explicitly specify a stack to operate
  on; but other instructions operate within an <em>environment</em> which you
  configure with the <code>ADDRESS</code> instruction.  STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR,
  files, and in-memory data stacks are all handled in a uniform and
  elegant fashion.  Above we used the external <code>rxqueue</code> utility, but we
  can equally well redirect output of utilities right within Rexx.  For
  example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-2.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM ls WITH OUTPUT FIFO '' ERROR NORMAL
DO i=1 WHILE queued() \= 0
  PARSE PULL line; SAY i || ") " || line; END

</pre></div><p>
  It might appear that the <code>ADDRESS</code> command is grabbing the output of
  just the <code>ls</code> utility; but it is actually changing the general
  execution environment for later external calls, e.g. this behaves
  identically:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-5.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM WITH OUTPUT FIFO '' ERROR NORMAL
ls
DO i=1 WHILE queued()\=0; PARSE PULL ln; SAY i||") "||ln; END

</pre></div><p>
  Any subsequent external commands, if they are run in the default
  <code>SYSTEM</code> environment, will direct their output to the default
  FIFO.(first-in-first-out). You could also output to a LIFO instead
  (either named or default)--the difference being that a FIFO adds to
  the "bottom" of the stack, and a LIFO to the "top." The instructions
  <code>PUSH</code> and <code>QUEUE</code> correspond to LIFO and FIFO operations on the
  stack. The instruction <code>PULL</code> or <code>PARSE PULL</code> take a string off the
  top of the stack.
</p>
<p>
  Another useful stack to look at is that of the command-line arguments
  to a Rexx script.  For example, we might want to execute an arbitrary
  command in our numbering utility, not always <code>ls</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>numbered-1.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
PARSE ARG cmd
ADDRESS SYSTEM cmd WITH OUTPUT FIFO ''
DO i=1 WHILE queued()\=0; PARSE PULL ln; SAY i||") "||ln; END

</pre></div><p>
  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>passing command to numbered-1</h4><pre>
$ ./numbered-2.rexx ps -a -x
1)   PID  TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
2)     1  ??  Ss     0:00.00 /sbin/init
3)     2  ??  Ss     0:00.19 /sbin/mach_init
4)    51  ??  Ss     0:01.95 kextd
[...]

</pre></div><p>
  <code>PARSE PULL</code> can be used to pull lines from user input. Following the
  example of the execution of the argument <code>cmd</code>, you could write a
  shell or interactive environment in Rexx (perhaps running either
  external utilities or built-in commands, much like <code>bash</code>).
</p>
<h3>Stem Variables And Associative Arrays</h3>
 <p>
  In Rexx--somewhat like in TCL--to a large extent <em>everything is a
  string</em>. Having stacks and streams composed of lines gives you a
  simple list or array of strings. But mostly, strings simply act like
  other datatypes <em>as needed</em>. For example, a string that contains a
  suitable representation of a number (digits, decimal, an exponent "e",
  etc.) can be used in arithmetic operations.  For processing reports,
  log files, and the like, this is exactly the behavior you want.
</p>
<p>
  Rexx, however, does have one additional standard datatype: associative
  arrays. In Rexx they go under the name "stem variables," but the
  concept is very similar that of dictionaries in many other languages.
  The syntax for stem variables will be oddly familiar to users of OOP
  languages like Java, Python, or Ruby: a dot separates "objects" and
  their "attributes."  This is not really object-orientation, but the
  syntax does (accidentally) highlight the degree to which an object
  resembles a particularly robust dictionary; there <em>are</em> OOP extensions
  to Rexx out there, but this article will not address them.
</p>
<p>
  Not every string is valid Rexx symbol--which restricts the keys in the
  dictionary--but Rexx is pretty liberal about its symbol names,
  compared to most languages. E.g.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using stem variables in Rexx</h4><pre>
$ cat stems.rexx
#!/usr/bin/rexx
foo.X_!1.bar = 1
foo.X_!1.23 = 2
foo.fop.fip = 3
foo.fop = 4
SAY foo.X_!1.bar # foo.X_!1.23 # foo.fop.fip # foo.fop # foo.fop.NOPE
$ ./stems.rexx
1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # FOO.FOP.NOPE

</pre></div><p>
  A couple features stand out in the example. We set a value for both a
  stem and its compound (e.g. <code>foo.fop</code> and <code>foo.fop.fip</code>). Also notice
  that the undefined symbol <code>foo.fop.nope</code> simply stands for its own
  spelling, absent an assignment to the contrary. This lets us skip
  quotes in most situations. Case of names is normalized to upper case
  in most Rexx contexts.
</p>
<p>
  One useful trick is to set a value for the dotted stem, which then
  acts as a default value for compound names based on the stem.  For the
  next example, we also make use of the capability to <code>ADDRESS</code> the
  sequential numbered symbols of a compound name as an output
  environment:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-3.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
ls. = UNDEF
ADDRESS SYSTEM ls WITH OUTPUT STEM ls.
DO i=1
    IF ls.i == UNDEF THEN LEAVE
    SAY i || ") " || ls.i
END

</pre></div><p>
  As soon as the loop gets to some compound variable name that was not
  populated by the output of the external <code>ls</code> utility, we detect the
  default value of "UNDEF" and leave the loop (if the output might
  contain that string, a false collision could occur, however).
</p>
<p>
  Rexx also has an error handling system that lets you <code>SIGNAL</code>
  conditions, and handle them appropriately.  Instead of checking for a
  default compound value, you can also catch the access to an undefined
  variable.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-6.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM ls WITH OUTPUT STEM ls.
SIGNAL ON NOVALUE NAME quit
DO i=1
    SAY i || ") " || ls.i
END
quit:

</pre></div><p>
  Just to round our <code>ls</code> variants out, here is one more that uses a file
  for its I/O:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ls-4.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM ls WITH OUTPUT STREAM files
DO i=1
    line = linein(files)
    IF line = "" THEN LEAVE
    SAY i || ") " || line
END
rm files

</pre></div><p>
  Since the output stream is a regular file, it is probably good to
  remove it at the end.
</p>
<h3>Text Processing Functions</h3>
 <p>
  The brief examples above will give readers a bit of the feel of Rexx
  as a programming language.  You can also, of course, define your own
  procedures and functions--in separate module files, if you wish--and
  call them either with the <code>CALL</code> instruction or using parenthesized
  arguments, as with some of the examples that use standard functions.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the greatest strength in Rexx as a text processing language is
  its useful collection of built-in string manipulation functions.
  Somewhere over half of all the standard Rexx functions are for working
  with strings, with a chunk of others thrown in for quite readable
  manipulation of bit vectors.  Moreover, even bit vectors are often
  manipulated (or read in) as strings of ones and zeros:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>bits.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
SAY b2c('01100001') b2c('01100010')         /* --&gt; a b */
SAY bitor(b2c('01100001'), b2c('01100010')) /* --&gt; c   */
SAY bitor('a','b')                          /* --&gt; c   */
EXIT
/* Function in ARexx, but not ANSI Rexx */
b2c: PROCEDURE
  ARG bits
  return x2c(b2x(bits))

</pre></div><p>
  A nice feature of Rexx's text handling functions is the naturalness of
  treating lines as being composed of whitespace separated <em>words</em>. For
  textual reports and log files, easily ignoring extraneous whitespace
  is quite useful--'awk' does something similar, but Python's
  <code>string.split()</code> quickly gets more "busy" in describing the same
  operations. In fact, "arrays" is Rexx just amount to whitespace
  separated strings. The <code>PULL</code> instruction will pull out variables from
  a general template pattern for a line, which at a minimal case allows
  word division:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>pushpull.rexx</h4><pre>
#!/usr/bin/rexx
PUSH "a b c d e f"
PULL x y " C " z   /* pull x and y before the C, remainder into z */
SAY x # y # z    /* --&gt; A # B # D E F */

</pre></div><p>
  Further dividing strings that may or may not have been pulled with a
  template is elegant. Functions like <code>wordpos()</code>, <code>word()</code>,
  <code>wordindex()</code> or <code>words()</code>, <code>subword()</code> let you refer to the "words"
  in a string as if they made up a list, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Working with words in a string</h4><pre>
seuss = "The cat in the hat came back"
thehat = wordpos('the hat', seuss)
SAY "'came'" is wordlength(seuss, thehat+2) letters long
/* --&gt; 'came' IS 4 LETTERS LONG */

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, you also get a rich collection of character-oriented
  functions as well.  It is equally easy to work with character
  positions using functions like <code>reverse()</code>, <code>right()</code>, <code>justify()</code>,
  <code>center()</code>, <code>pos()</code>, or <code>substr()</code> (and others).
</p>
<p>
  Another batch of the built-in functions let you work with dates and
  numbers in a flexible, report-oriented, way. That is, numbers can be
  read and written in a variety of formats, with arbitrary
  (configurable) precision. Dates, similarly, can be read, written and
  converted among many formats with standard function calls (e.g.
  day-of-week, days-in-century, European versus US dates, etc.). The
  flexibility with dates and numbers is probably less often necessary in
  writing system scripts and processing log files than it is in working
  with semi-structured output reports from database applications. But
  when you need it, it is much more robust to have well-tested built-in
  functions than to write your own ad-hoc converters and formatters.
</p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
 <p>
  Coming more out of an IBM "big-iron" environment than from Unix
  systems, Rexx is little-known to many Linux programmers and systems
  administrators.  But there remains an important Linux niche where
  Rexx is a better scripting solution than either the "too-light" <code>bash</code>
  or <code>ksh</code> shells, or the "too-heavy" interpreted programming languages
  like Python, Perl, Ruby, TCL, or maybe Scheme.  For quick and easily
  readable scripts that perform text manipulation on the inputs and
  outputs of external processes, Rexx is hard to beat, and not hard to
  learn or install.
