    This column continues an earlier installment's introduction
    to functional programming (FP) in Python.  A number of
    intermediate or advanced FP concepts are demonstrated in
    here.  Readers of this column will benefit from an
    introduction to different paradigms of program
    problem-solving.


WHAT IS PYTHON?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.


WADING INTO FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The previous _Charming Python_ column on functional programming
  introduced some basic concepts of FP.  With the basics in mind,
  this column will delve a little bit deeper into this quite rich
  conceptual realm.  For much of our delving, Bryn Keller's
  "Xoltar Toolkit" will provide valuable assistance.  Keller has
  collected many of the strengths of FP into a nice little module
  of pure Python implementations of the techniques.  In addition
  to the module [functional], Xoltar Toolkit includes the [lazy]
  module which supports structures that evaluate "only when
  needed."  Many traditionally functional languages also have
  lazy evaluation, so between these components, the Xoltar
  Toolkit lets you do much of what you might find in a functional
  language like Haskell.


BINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Attentive readers will remember a limitation I pointed out to
  the functional techniques described in the earlier column.
  Specifically, nothing in Python prevents the rebinding of names
  that are used to denote functional expressions.  In FP, names
  are generally understood to be simply abbreviations of longer
  expressions, but the promise is implicit that "the same
  expression will always evaluate to the same result."  If
  denotational names get rebound, the promise is broken.  For
  example, let's say that we define some shorthand expressions
  that we'd like to use in our functional program, such as:

      #---- Python FP session w/ rebinding causing mischief ---#
      >>> car = lambda lst: lst[0]
      >>> cdr = lambda lst: lst[1:]
      >>> sum2 = lambda lst: car(lst)+car(cdr(lst))
      >>> sum2(range(10))
      1
      >>> car = lambda lst: lst[2]
      >>> sum2(range(10))
      5

  Unfortunately, the very same expression 'sum2(range(10))'
  evaluates to two different things at two points in our program,
  even though this expression itself does not use any mutable
  variables in its arguments.

  [functional], fortunately, provides a class called 'Bindings'
  (proposed to Keller by your author) that prevents such
  rebindings (at least accidentally, Python does not try to
  prevent a determined programmer who wants to break things).
  While use of 'Bindings' requires a little extra syntax, it
  makes accidents hard to commit.  In his examples within the
  [functional] module, Keller names a 'Bindings' instance 'let'
  (I presume after the 'let' keyword in ML-family languages).
  For example, we might do:

      #------- Python FP session with guarded rebinding -------#
      >>> from functional import *
      >>> let = Bindings()
      >>> let.car = lambda lst: lst[0]
      >>> let.car = lambda lst: lst[2]
      Traceback (innermost last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
        File "d:\tools\functional.py", line 976, in __setattr__
          raise BindingError, "Binding '%s' cannot be modified." % name
      functional.BindingError:  Binding 'car' cannot be modified.
      >>> let.car(range(10))
      0

  Obviously, a real program would have to do something about
  catching these 'BindingError's, but the fact they are raised
  avoids a class of problems.

  Along with 'Bindings', [functional] provides a 'namespace'
  function to pull off a namespace (really, a dictionary) from a
  'Bindings' instance.  This comes in handy if you want to
  compute an expression within a (immutable) namespace defined in
  a 'Bindings'.  'eval()' is the Python function that allows
  evaluation within a namespace.  An example should clarify:

      #----- Python FP session using immutable namespaces -----#
      >>> let = Bindings()      # "Real world" function names
      >>> let.r10 = range(10)
      >>> let.car = lambda lst: lst[0]
      >>> let.cdr = lambda lst: lst[1:]
      >>> eval('car(r10)+car(cdr(r10))', namespace(let))
      1
      >>> inv = Bindings()      # "Inverted list" function names
      >>> inv.r10 = let.r10
      >>> inv.car = lambda lst: lst[-1]
      >>> inv.cdr = lambda lst: lst[:-1]
      >>> eval('car(r10)+car(cdr(r10))', namespace(inv))
      17


CLOSURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  One very interesting concept in FP is a -closure-.  In fact,
  closures have proved sufficiently interesting to many
  developers that even generally non-functional languages like
  Perl and Ruby include closures as a feature.  Moreover, Python
  2.1 currently appears destined to add lexical scoping, which
  turns out to get one 99% of the way to closures.

  So what -is- a closure, anyway?  Steve Majewski has recently
  provided a nice characterization of the concept on the Python
  newsgroup:

    An object is a piece of data with procedures attached to it...
    A closure is a procedure with a piece of data attached to it.

  That is, a closure is something like FP's Jekyll to OOP's Hyde
  (or perhaps the roles are the other way around).  A closure,
  like an object instance, is a way of carrying around a bundle
  of data and functionality, wrapped up together.

  Let's step back just a bit to see what problem both objects and
  closures solve, and also to see how the problem can be solved
  without either.  What a function returns is usually determined
  by a certain context around its calculation.  The most
  common--and perhaps the most obvious--way of specifying this
  context is to pass some arguments to the function that tell it
  what values it should operate on.  But sometimes also, there is
  a natural distinction between "background" and "foreground"
  arguments--between what the function is doing this particular
  time, and the way the function is "configured" for multiple
  potential calls.

  There are a number of ways to handle background, while
  focussing on foreground.  One way is to simply "bite the
  bullet" and pass every argument a function needs at every
  invocation.  This often amounts to passing a number of values
  (or a structure with multiple slots) up and down a call chain,
  in the possiblity the values will be needed somewhere in the
  chain.  A trivial example might look like:

      #--------- Python session showing cargo variable --------#
      >>> def a(n):
      ...     add7 = b(n)
      ...     return add7
      ...
      >>> def b(n):
      ...     i = 7
      ...     j = c(i,n)
      ...     return j
      ...
      >>> def c(i,n):
      ...     return i+n
      ...
      >>> a(10)     # Pass cargo value for use downstream
      17

  In the cargo example, within 'b()', 'n' has no purpose other
  than being available to pass on to 'c()'.  Another option is to
  use global variables:

      #--------- Python session showing global variable -------#
      >>> N = 10
      >>> def addN(i):
      ...     global N
      ...     return i+N
      ...
      >>> addN(7)   # Add global N to argument
      17
      >>> N = 20
      >>> addN(6)   # Add global N to argument
      26

  The global 'N' is simply available whenever you want to call
  'addN()', but there is no need to pass the global background
  "context" explicitly.  A somwhat more Pythonic technique is to
  "freeze" a variable into a function using a default argument at
  definition time:

      #-------- Python session showing frozen variable --------#
      >>> N = 10
      >>> def addN(i, n=N):
      ...     return i+n
      ...
      >>> addN(5)   # Add 10
      15
      >>> N = 20
      >>> addN(6)   # Add 10 (current N doesn't matter)
      16

  Our frozen variable is essentially a closure.  Some data is
  "attached" to the 'addN()' function.  For a complete closure,
  all the data present when 'addN()' was defined would be
  available at invocation.  However, in this example (and many
  more robust ones), it is simple to make -enough- available with
  default arguments.  Variables that are never used by 'addN()'
  thereby make no difference to its calculation.

  Let's look next at an OOP approach to a slightly more realistic
  problem.  The time of year has prompted my thoughts about those
  "interview" style tax program that collect various bits of
  data--not necessarily in a particular order--then eventually
  use them all for a caculation.  Let's create a simplistic
  version of this:

      #----- Python-style tax calculation class/instance ------#
      class TaxCalc:
          def taxdue(self):
              return (self.income-self.deduct)*self.rate
      taxclass = TaxCalc()
      taxclass.income = 50000
      taxclass.rate = 0.30
      taxclass.deduct = 10000
      print "Pythonic OOP taxes due =", taxclass.taxdue()

  In our 'TaxCalc' class (or rather, in its instance), we can
  collect some data--in whatever order we like--and once we have
  all the elements needed, we can call a method of this object to
  perform a calculation on the bundle of data.  Everything stays
  together within the instance, and further, a different instance
  can carry a different bundle of data.  The possibility of
  creating multiple instances, differing only in their data is
  something that was not possible in the "global variable" or
  "frozen variable" approaches.  The "cargo" approach can handle
  this, but for the expanded example, we can see it might become
  necessary to start passing around numerous values.  While we
  are here, it is interesting to note how a message-passing OOP
  style might approach this (Smalltalk or Self are similar to
  this, and so are several OOP xBase variants I have used):

      #------- Smalltalk-style (Python) tax calculation -------#
      class TaxCalc:
          def taxdue(self):
              return (self.income-self.deduct)*self.rate
          def setIncome(self,income):
              self.income = income
              return self
          def setDeduct(self,deduct):
              self.deduct = deduct
              return self
          def setRate(self,rate):
              self.rate = rate
              return self
      print "Smalltalk-style taxes due =", \
            TaxCalc().setIncome(50000).setRate(0.30).setDeduct(10000).taxdue()

  Returning 'self' with each "setter" allows us to treat the
  "current" thing as a result of every method application.  This
  will have some interesting similarities to the FP closure
  approach.

  With the Xoltar toolkit, we can create full closures that have
  our desired property of combining data with a function, and
  also allowing multiple closures (nee objects) to contain
  different bundles:

      #------- Python Functional-Style tax calculations -------#
      from functional import *

      taxdue        = lambda: (income-deduct)*rate
      incomeClosure = lambda income,taxdue: closure(taxdue)
      deductClosure = lambda deduct,taxdue: closure(taxdue)
      rateClosure   = lambda rate,taxdue: closure(taxdue)

      taxFP = taxdue
      taxFP = incomeClosure(50000,taxFP)
      taxFP = rateClosure(0.30,taxFP)
      taxFP = deductClosure(10000,taxFP)
      print "Functional taxes due =",taxFP()

      print "Lisp-style taxes due =", \
            incomeClosure(50000,
                rateClosure(0.30,
                    deductClosure(10000, taxdue)))()

  Each closure function we have defined takes any values defined
  within the function scope, and binds those values into the
  global scope of the function object.  However, what appears as
  the function's global scope is not necessarily the same as the
  true module global scope, nor identical to a different closure's
  "global" scope.  The closure simply "carries the data" with it.

  In our example, we utilize a few particular functions to put
  specific bindings within a closure's scope (income, deduct,
  rate).  It would be simple enough to modify the design to put
  any arbitrary binding into scope.  We also--just for the fun of
  it--use two slightly different functional styles in the
  example.  The first successively binds additional values into
  closure scope; by allowing 'taxFP' to be mutable, these "add to
  closure" lines can appear in any order.  However, if we were to
  use immutable names like 'tax_with_Income', we would have to
  arrange the binding lines in a specific order, and pass the
  earlier bindings to the next ones.  In any case, once
  everything necessary is bound into closure scope, we can call
  the "seeded" function.

  The second style looks a bit more like Lisp, to my eyes (the
  parentheses mostly).  Beyond the aesthetic, two interesting
  things happen in the second style.  The first is that name
  binding is avoided altogether.  This second style is a single
  expression, with no statements used (see this column's
  predecessor for a discussion of why this matters).

  The other interesting thing about the "Lisp-style" use of the
  closures is how much it resembles the "Smalltalk-style"
  message-passing methods given above.  Both essentially
  accumulate values along the way to calling the 'taxdue()'
  function/method (both will raise errors in these crude versions
  if the right data is not available).  The "Smalltalk-style"
  passes an object between each step, while the "Lisp-style"
  passes a continuation.  But deep down, functional and
  object-oriented programming amount to much the same thing.


TAIL RECURSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In this installment, we have knocked off a bit more of the
  domain of functional programming.  What remains is less (and
  provably simpler?) than what did before (the title of the
  section is a minor joke; unfortunately, its concept is not
  explained herein).  An excellent way to continue with a number
  of FP concepts is by reading the [functional] module's source.
  The module is very well commented, and provides examples of
  most of its functions/classes.  Not covered in this column are
  a number of simplifying meta-functions that make the
  combinations and interaction of other functions simpler to
  handle.  These are definitely worth checking out for a Python
  programmer seeking to continue the exploration of functional
  paradigms.


RESOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Bryn Keller's "xoltar toolkit" which includes the module
  [functional] adds a large number of useful FP extensions to
  Python.  Since the [functional] module is itself written
  entirely in Python, what it does was already possible in Python
  itself.  But Keller has figured out a very nicely integrated
  set of extensions, with a lot of power in compact definitions.
  The toolkit can be found at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/xoltar-toolkit

  Peter Norvig has written an interesting article, _Python for
  Lisp Programmers_.  While the focus there is somewhat the
  reverse of my column, it provides very good general comparisons
  between Python and Lisp:

    http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html

  A good starting point for functional programming is the
  _Frequently Asked Questions for comp.lang.functional_ :

    http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh//faq.html#functional-languages

  The author has found it much easier to get a grasp of
  functional programming via the language Haskell than in
  Lisp/Scheme (even though the latter is probably more widely
  used, if only in Emacs).  Other Python programmers might
  similarly have an easier time without quite so many parentheses
  and prefix (Polish) operators.

    http://www.haskell.org/

  An excellent introductory book is:

    Haskell:  The Craft of Functional Programming (2nd Edition),
    Simon Thompson, Addison-Wesley (1999).
