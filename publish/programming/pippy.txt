    Pippy is a port of (a subset of) Python to the PalmOS.  With
    Pippy, Python programmers can create custom applications to
    run on Palm devices, as well as use Pippy as an interactive
    environment directly on the Palm.  David evaluates the
    stengths and limitations of Pippy as a means of implementing
    Palm applications.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Let me introduce Pippy in the style of a good news/bad news
  joke.  The good news about Pippy is that it allows a Python
  programmer to write and run programs right on the Palm.
  Moreover, with version 0.7, Pippy has gotten faster, more
  stable, and easier to use.  The bad news is that, so far, Pippy
  is still fairly "bleeding edge" software; and a lot of the
  things one would want in a development environment are only
  planned for later versions, not available today.  Still, Pippy
  gives you enough to play with now, and even to do some useful
  things without too much effort.


INSTALLING PIPPY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The first thing to do when installing Pippy is download its
  executables and/or source archives.  The source archive is
  available as a tarball, called 'pippy-0.7-src.tar.gz', while
  the executable-only distribution is called 'pippy_0_7.zip' (or
  the same name with a '.tar.gz', '.sit' or 'hqx' extension,
  depending on your platform).  The easiest thing is probably to
  stick with the executable distribution, for most users.  Let's
  look at that first.

  Within a Pippy executable archive, you'll find a relative
  directory called './pippy_0_7'.  Inside this directory are five
  files.  Read the 'README'--as always--and check out the
  'LICENSE' and 'NEWS' files for the expected topics.  But the
  main thing that will interest you is the files 'pippy.prc' and
  'pylib.prc'.  These are the ones that you want to upload to
  your PalmOS device.

  The way you'll upload these to your handheld will vary
  depending on the desktop OS that you are running.  However,
  users who have ever installed any additional applications to
  their PalmOS handheld will be familiar with the procedure.
  Under Windows and MacOS environments, you will usually use the
  "Palm Desktop" and its "Install" button.  Under Linux or other
  Unix-like platforms or OS/2, you will probably use the
  'pilot-link' utilities--specifically the 'pilot-xfer' program.
  This might look something like:

      #----- Transfering Pippy and PythonLib to the Palm ------#
      $ pilot-xfer /dev/cua1 -i pippy.prc
      $ pilot-xfer /dev/cua1 -i pylib.prc

  Once both the PRCs are on you PalmOS handheld, all you'll need
  to do is run 'Pippy' (I like to move it to a "Programming"
  Applications category, but this is a small convenience).

  Compiling Pippy is a lot more work than is just downloading the
  executables.  There are two programming environments under
  which you might build Pippy.  One involves getting PRC-Tools
  set up on your machine, and also Python 1.5.2 (exactly that
  version).  Installing PRC-Tools itself is a complex game of
  chasing down library and compiler dependencies, and finding
  exactly the right version of everything.  All the details of
  doing that are not covered in this article.

  For Win32 and MacOS environments, you might have an easier
  route to compiling Pippy.  First you'll need to shell out some
  money for CodeWarrior.  Next you'll need to download and
  successfully install the free tools Cygwin, PilRC, and Python
  1.5.2 (a higher version of Python might work).  While possibly
  less work than the PRC-Tools route, this route to compiling
  Pippy yourself is also not pain-free unless you happen to
  already have a system with all the prerequisites.

  If you do manage to build Pippy from source, you'll have the
  option of compiling in your own Python extension modules, and
  you will be able to import them by default. For this article,
  we'll just assume you are using the distributed executable
  version of Pippy.  Fortunately, as of version 0.7, running
  custom code in the precompiled environment is a lot easier.


WORKING WITH PIPPY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pippy is an interactive environment, similar to the Python
  interactive shell, but owing even more to another PalmOS
  language/environment called LispMe (see Resources).  For now,
  Pippy is -just- this interactive environment, not a way of
  creating standalone applications (unless you want to delve
  deeper into the source than I was able to go).  That makes a
  good start though.  Let's see what it looks like:

  {A PalmOS handheld running Pippy:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/pippy1.gif}

  Using Pippy is simply a matter of entering Python commands.
  The picture illustrates this, but you can also create larger
  scale constructs like function definitions and classes.

  One thing to watch out for in the interactive environment is
  that you need to 'eval' each statement suite as soon as you
  write it.  This can get a bit confusing, unfortunately, since
  some statements can get ignored in the interactive environment.
  For example, if you enter the below statements then press
  'eval', you would almost certainly expect to see "4" printed:

  {A Pippy session with multiple statements at once:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/pippy_multi_eval.gif}

      #---- Pippy session with multiple statements at once ----#
      x = 3
      x = 4
      print x

  What happens instead is that nothing gets printed, and 'x' is
  left equal to 3.  Hopefully, this behavior will be improved for
  later versions.


USING STORED PROGRAMS WITH PIPPY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fortunately, there is a much more practical and useful way to
  work with Pippy than simply entering statements into the
  interactive environment.  That way is using the "Memo Pad"
  application to store Python programs you wish to run later.
  All there is to this is just creating a Memo Pad category
  called "Python" (case is important), then storing Python
  programs as memos therein.  The one rule you'll need to follow
  is that each memo should start with a pound sign followed by
  the name of the Python script/module being implemented.  For
  example, the below is a simple program I wrote (entirely on the
  Palm, without touching a desktop computer):

      #----- A simple Python program written on the Palm ------#
      #go2.py
      def go(data):
          from string import split
          add=lambda i,j: i+j
          lines=split(data,'\012')
          rows=[]
          for line in lines:
              fs=split(line)
              for i in range(len(fs)):
                  fs[i]=int(fs[i])
              if fs: rows.append(fs)
          print 'Records:',len(rows)
          print '-----------------',
          i=1
          for row in rows:
              print '\nROW',i,
              cnt=len(row)
              print ' -count:',cnt,
              tot=reduce(add,row)
              print ' -tot:',tot,
              avg=tot/cnt
              print ' -avg:',avg,
              i=i+1

  You may notice that I have used somewhat short variable names,
  and done a few other things to keep code lines short.  I find
  it distracting when lines wrap on the Palm screen, since it
  makes it difficult to see which lines are wrapped for display,
  and which for program structure.  But basically, this is a
  perfectly normal (albeit simple and boring) Python program.
  Let's look at an interactive session that uses this program.

      #----- Pippy Interactive Session using Memo imports -----#
      Python 1.5.2+ (#1, Jun 11 2001, 15:41:50)  [GCC 2.95.2-kgpd 19991024 (release)]
      Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam

      import memoimp; memoimp.install()

      from go2 import go
      from data import data
      go(data)
      Records: 4
      -----------------
      ROW 1  -count: 5  -tot: 288  -avg: 57
      ROW 2  -count: 4  -tot: 193  -avg: 48
      ROW 3  -count: 7  -tot: 64  -avg: 9
      ROW 4  -count: 4  -tot: 398  -avg: 99
      from data2 import data
      go(data)
      Records: 2
      -----------------
      ROW 1  -count: 4  -tot: 173  -avg: 43
      ROW 2  -count: 8  -tot: 45  -avg: 5

  Notice the first line in particular.  Before you can import
  from the Memo Pad, you need to import the [memoimp] module, and
  run its '.install()' method.  I think the developers should
  make this the default for later versions, but in the meanwhile,
  it is handy to keep the first line in the clipboard (and in a
  memo to copy it there easily).

  For completeness, let's take a look at what one of these "data"
  modules might look like:

  {A Memo Pad data file module:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/pippy_data_file.gif}

  It is easy enough to imagine that this little memo could be
  used to collect some sort of field data for which a handheld
  was ideal: count bird distributions for ornithological
  research; count widgets on each of the warehouse shelves; etc.
  One could easily enough add some more structure and formatting
  to the data, and parse out that structure accordingly.  The
  example just produces some simplistic statistical data.


THAT's WHY THEY CALL IT A BETA
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Like I wrote at the beginning, Pippy is still living at the
  bleeding edge.  The stability is actually great, it is the
  features that are missing.  Even some pretty basic ones.  All
  things will come with time.

  The first thing an astute reader will have noticed is that my
  sample application went through some slightly odd contortions
  to get its input data.  Why not just set up an 'input()' or
  'raw_input()' loop, and collect the data there--maybe
  processing it with each entry.  The problem is, the PalmOS has
  no concept of a file; in particular, it has no concept of
  STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR.  The 'print' statment doesn't really
  go to STDOUT, but rather to the special console.  But the
  interactive input just isn't there at all.

  One developer has suggested to me that it was -possible- to
  call custom forms from Pippy, where these forms were themselves
  created by other development systems.  But using forms this way
  would be rather roundabout, and is not documented yet in any
  case.  Look for something better in future versions--maybe a
  simulation of STDIN and STDERR and/or some tools to easily
  produce Pippy-specific Palm GUI forms.  For now, however, Pippy
  is most useful for batch processing (reminding me of my
  early--and quite pleasant in retrospect--experiences with
  IBM 360 punchcard queus).

  Beyond interactive input, a number of modules and capabilities
  are still in the planning stages.  The most important of these
  is probably *floating point numbers*!  Unfortunately, this
  rather important basic type is still on the drawing board.  I
  would guess the reason has something to do with the
  floating-point architecture of the Dragonball processor.  But
  this is just a guess, I could be wrong.

  Of significant, but not quite as critical, importance are
  various missing modules.  [re] isn't there, which would be a
  nice one.  [os] is also missing, but there might actually be
  some good reasons for that one.  Some other modules that are
  pretty standard are also gone.

  Moreover, there are some additional goals for Pippy by its
  developers.  Updating Pippy to the newest Python versions would
  be nice--especially to include list comprehensions for
  conciseness.  As well, Pippy developers want to include
  Christian Tismer's Stackless Python patches to Pippy.  This
  should improve performance quite a bit for the PalmOS hardware
  (and would be just plain cool).


CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The last portion of this writeup pointed to some fairly stark
  limitations of Pippy 0.7.  One might read that as a criticism,
  but that is not at all the author's intent.  I find Pippy to be
  one of the most exciting Python projects I have looked at.
  While Pippy is certainly not yet complete, it is proceeding in
  exactly the right way.  The intermediate versions (like 0.7)
  are stable, and are improving in speed.  Things are left
  out--but they -are- called betas--but what gets in there is
  well thought out and well implemented.  This is the Python
  philosophy in action:  first get it right, then add the
  bells-and-whistles.  Still... maybe it is not too much to wish
  for a few bells in the near future.

  PRC-Tools is the Linux (and other OS's) way of building C/C++
  PalmOS applications.  It consists of a bunch of related free
  software tools, that let you target the Palm's 68k (Dragonball)
  CPU and hardware environment. If you want to take a try at
  installing PRC-Tools, its home is at:

  _Metrowerks CodeWarrior for Palm OS Platform_ is an excellent
  IDE and compiler for PalmOS development, at least if you use a
  Win32 or MacOS machine.  CodeWarrior is pretty much the
  "standard" development tool for PalmOS, being the tool that
  Palm Computing uses to develop the OS, for example.  If you'd
  like to obtain a copy, take a look below.  CodeWarrior is a
  commercial product, and you will probably have to pay money to
  get it (the amount depends on the license details):

  Another language available for the PalmOS provided an
  inspiration for Pippy's interactive interface.  You can read
