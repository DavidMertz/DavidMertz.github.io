WHY PYTHON?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For anyone out there who doesn't know, Python is a freely
  available, very-high-level, interpreted language developed by
  Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear syntax with powerful
  (but optional) object-oriented semantics.  Python has a lot of
  the same strengths as other script languages used for
  web-programming:  good text processing tools; dictionaries
  (hash-tables) and other versitile types; a broad range of
  modules (libraries) relating to web-programming.  Compared to
  Perl, most people find Python code easier to read and maintain.
  Compared to VBScript or ColdFusion, Python packs much more
  powerful basic constructs.  Compared to PHP, TCL, REXX (or C
  for that matter), it is a lot easier to make nicely modular and
  object-oriented code in Python.  Compared to JSP, Python is
  concise, dynamic, and loosely-typed (in short, a lot quicker to
  develop).  Compared to Bash...

  OK, you figured me out.  I am a Pythonista, a convert to all
  things Pythonic.  I have had the opportunity to do a bit of
  programming in a lot of languages, and have found Python my
  favorite among them for most purposes.  Of course, there are
  many more languages I've never yet managed "Hello World!" in,
  so who knows.  But let me avoid proselytizing, and pass on a
  few hints for getting started with CGI programming in Python.

  Before I start, let me mention that CGI has sometimes gotten a
  bad reputation.  This reputation is mostly ill-deserved.
  Plain CGI indeed has some overhead to it (in the need to 'fork'
  processes mostly).  But you can't beat old-fashion CGI for
  rapid development and server portability.  If speed turns into
  a real issue (good enough should be good enough, however), a
  number of solutions are available to speed things up:
  Python/ASP, fastcgi, mod_python, JPython servlets, Medusa,
  Zope.  Or write your own by using the module [CGIHTTPServer].
  Links to these solutions, and other helpful third-party tools,
  are given at bottom of this article.  Most of the advice here
  about plain CGI will apply if one of the speedup solutions are
  used, but you'll need to see the respective documentation for
  details.


USING THE [cgi] MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Python's [cgi] module--in the standard distribution--is usually
  the place to start in writing CGI programs in Python.  The main
  use of the [cgi] module is to extract the values passed to a
  CGI program from an HTML form.  Most typically, one interacts
  with CGI applications by means of an HTML form.  One fills out
  some values in the form that specify details of the action to
  be performed, then call on the CGI to perform its action using
  your specifications.

  You may include many input fields within an HTML form, and the
  fields can be of a number of different types (text, checkboxes,
  picklists, radio buttons, etc.).  Chuck Musciano wrote a nice
  series of articles for Webreview.com explaining all the form
  elements, beginning with:

    http://webreview.com/pub/98/10/09/tag/index.html.

  Your Python script should begin with 'import cgi' to make
  sorting out its calling form easy.  One thing this module does
  is hide any details of the difference between "get" and "post"
  methods from the CGI script.  By the time the call is made,
  this is not a detail the CGI creator needs to worry about.  The
  main thing done by the CGI module is to treat all the fields in
  the calling HTML form in a dictionary-like fashion.  What you
  get is not *quite* a Python dictionary, but it is close enough
  to be easy to work with.  Let's play around with it:

      #----- Example of working with Python [cgi] module -----#
      import cgi
      form = cgi.FieldStorage()   # FieldStorage object to
                                  # hold the form data

      # check whether a field called "username" was used...
      # it might be used multiple times (so sep w/ commas)
      if form.has_key('username'):
          username = form["username"]
          usernames = ""
          if type(username) is type([]):
              # Multiple username fields specified
              for item in username:
                  if usernames:
                      # Next item -- insert comma
                      usernames = usernames + "," + item.value
                  else:
                      # First item -- don't insert comma
                      usernames = item.value
          else:
              # Single username field specified
              usernames = username.value

      # just for the fun of it let's create an HTML list
      # of all the fields on the calling form
      field_list = '<ul>\n'
      for field in form.keys():
          field_list = field_list + '<li>%s</li>\n' % field
      field_list = field_list + '</ul>\n'

  We'll have to do something more to present a useful page to the
  user, but we've made a good start by working with the
  submitting form.


GETTING THE OUTPUT RIGHT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Past parsing the query form that called your Python CGI, the
  next thing you need to do is send something back to the client
  browser.  Judging from questions on the comp.lang.python
  newsgroup, the most common mistake made by beginners is
  forgetting to include a blank line between the HTTP header(s)
  and the HTML document (or forgetting the header altogether).
  Be sure to put something like the following in your Python CGI:

      #----------- Writing HTTP header in Python -------------#
      print 'Content-type: text/html\n\n'

  Of course, if you want to send back something other than an
  HTML page, the header should indicate that.  But be sure to
  have a header in any case.  For example, a dynamically
  generated image (using Python's [pil] module, for example)
  might start with:

      #----------- Writing HTTP header in Python -------------#
      print 'Content-type: image/jpeg\n\n'

  Once the header is there (and it might include other header
  lines, such as setting cookies), we need to compose an HTML
  page.  It is perfectly acceptable to use a bunch of 'print'
  statements in a row to output the whole page, like:

      #------- Step-by-step HTML creation in Python ----------#
      print '<html><head>'
      print '<title>My Page</title>'
      print '</head><body>'
      print '<h1>Powers of two</h1>\n<ol>'
      for n in range(1,11):
        print '<li>'+str(2**n)+'</li>'
      print '</ol></body></html>'

  A technique that is often more readable and easier to work with
  is to use Python's 'sprintf()' style string formatting on a
  page template of the whole HTML page (usally as the last thing
  in the script, after the variables have been computed).  You
  can do this with tuples like (and using Python's nifty
  triple-quoting for multiple line expressions):

      #------- Formatting sprintf()-style in Python ----------#
      print """<html><head>
      <title>%s</title>
      </head><body>
      <h1>Famous irrational numbers</h1>
      <dl><dt>Pi</dt>
          <dd>%2.3f</dd>
          <dt>Square-root of 2</dt>
          <dd>%2.3f</dd></dl>
      </body></html>""" % ("Another Page", 3.1415, 1.4142)

  Python has an even better trick up its sleeve, however.  In
  addition to using positional '%' expressions in a string, you
  can use named expression that are pulled from a dictionary:

      #------- Dictionary sprintf()-style in Python ----------#
      mydict = {"title":"Formatted from Dict",
                "pi": 3.1415, "e": 2.7182,
                "sqrt3": 1.73205, "sqrt2": 1.4142}
      template = """<html><head>
      <title>%(title)s</title>
      </head><body>
      <h1>Famous irrational numbers</h1>
      <dl><dt>Pi</dt>
          <dd>%(pi)2.3f</dd>
          <dt>Square-root of 2</dt>
          <dd>%(sqrt2)2.3f</dd></dl>
      </body></html>"""
      print template % mydict


TRICKS FOR DEBUGGING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As easy as Python makes writing a CGI script, there is always
  the possibility some mistakes will creep into the code.
  Fortunately, it is not hard to design a Python CGI program in
  such a way as to catch a helpful traceback.  Depending on what
  your needs are, you might either want to log errors to server
  storage, or display them in the client browser.

  The simplest case is coaxing a CGI to display errors in the
  client browser (if displaying the desired page fails).  The
  first thing to know for this is that Python errors and
  tracebacks are sent to STDERR, while web-servers normally pick
  up the output of STDOUT.  It might seem like we have a
  problem... until we notice the redefining STDERR is simple in
  Python.  Here's what a script might look like:

      #---------- Debugging CGI script in Python -------------#
      import sys
      sys.stderr = sys.stdout

      def main():
          import cgi
          # ...do the actual work of the CGI...
          # perhaps ending with:
          print template % script_dictionary

      print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"
      main()

  This approach is not bad for quick debugging.  Unfortunately,
  though, the traceback (if one occurs) gets displayed as HTML,
  which means that you need to go to "View Source" in a browser
  to see the original linebreaks in the traceback.  With a few
  more lines, we can add a little extra sophistication.

      #------- Debugging/logging CGI script in Python --------#
      import sys, traceback
      print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"
      try:               # use explicit exception handling
          import my_cgi  # main CGI functionality in 'my_cgi.py'
          my_cgi.main()
      except:
          import time
          errtime = '--- '+ time.ctime(time.time()) +' ---\n'
          errlog = open('cgi_errlog', 'a')
          errlog.write(errtime)
          traceback.print_exc(None, errlog)
          print "<html><head><title>CGI Error Encountered!</title></head>"
          print "<body><p>Sorry, a problem was encountered running MyCGI</p>"
          print "<p>Please check the error log on the server for details</p>"
          print "</body></html>"

  The second approach is quite generic as a wrapper for any real
  CGI functionality we might write.  Just 'import' a different
  CGI module as needed; and maybe make the error messages more
  detailed or friendlier.


OTHER HANDY (THIRD-PARTY) MODULES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Once a web programmer has gotten started with writing Python
  CGI's, she's likely to find the need to use some more Python
  capabilities.  Third party modules and tools for most anything
  are available, usually for free.  The best place to start in
  looking for Python tools is the Vaults of Parnassus:

    http://www.vex.net/parnassus/

  For general tutorials and references, or to download Python
  itself, take a look at the Python home:

    http://www.python.org

  In the first section, I mentioned some options for speeding up
  CGI's using various server-enhancement techniques.  Most of
  those can be found on the Vaults.  But a few deserve special
  links.

  JPython is an implementation of the Python language in 100%
  Pure Java.  JPython compiles Python source code into Java
  bytecodes, and most handily, allows you to call any Java class
  from right in your JPython source code (using friendly Python
  syntax and semantics).  The rub here is that you can write Java
  servlets in Python!:

    http://www.jpython.org

  Zope may be Python's "Killer App."  Zope is a free
  web-application development system written in Python (with
  little bits of C for time-critical parts).  It handles
  persistence, versioning, security, and just about everything
  else.  And best of all, you can script it in its native Python:

    http://www.zope.org

  You can also find a number of excellent articles on Zope here
  at Webreview.com.  Take a look at:

WRAPPING UP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our five minutes should help get you started on Python CGI.
  Play with what we have gone over, put up a few CGI's on a
  web-site you have access to, get a feel for what is going on.
  Make some mistakes even, there is no better way to learn.
  After you are comfortable with the basics, I am sure you'll
  want to move on to some of the really fancy things you can do
  with Python and CGI's.  Maybe you'll want to generate information
  from an SQL database (check out the database modules).  Maybe
  you'll want to dynamically generate images (check out [pil]).
  Whatever direction you want to go, there is plenty of room to
  grow, and the learning curve is an easy one to master.
