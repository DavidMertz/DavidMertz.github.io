    An interesting side project of the Python Enterprise Application Kit
    (PEAK) is the <code>setuptools</code> framework. Using <code>setuptools</code> replaces
    the standard library <code>disutils</code> as well as adding versioned package
    and dependency management to Python. Perl users will be familiar
    with CPAN, and Ruby users with Gems: The tool <code>ez_setup</code> that
    bootstraps <code>setuptools</code> and the expanded <code>easy_install</code> that comes
    with it act in conjunction with "Cheeseshot" (the Python Package
    Index, also called "PyPI") to achieve the same thing. Moreover,
    <code>setuptools</code> lets you package your libraries in a single-file
    archive called an "egg"--which is a lot like a Java jar, just for
    Python.
</blockquote>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
 <p>
  The <code>setuptools</code> module does a really good job of "getting out of the
  way". For example, if you download a package that was built using
  <code>setuptools</code> rather than <code>disutils</code>, installation should work just as
  you are used to: the usual dance of <code>python setup.py install</code>. In
  order to accomplish this, a package bundled using <code>setuptools</code>
  includes the small bootstrap module <code>ez_setup.py</code> in the archive. The
  only caveat here is that <code>ez_setup.py</code> tries to download and install
  the necessary <code>setuptool</code> package in the background--which depends, of
  course, on having a networked machine. If <code>setuptools</code> is already
  installed on the local machine, this background step is not necessary;
  but if it needs to be installed manually, that loses much of the
  transparency.  Still, most systems nowadays have an internet
  connection; and taking a few special steps for non-networked machines
  is not necessarily unduly burdensome.
</p>
<p>
  The real benefits of <code>setuptools</code> is not in doing roughly what
  <code>distutils</code> does, even though it <em>does</em> enhance the capabilities of
  <code>distutils</code> and simplify what goes into a <code>setup.py</code> script.  The
  greatest gain is <code>setuptools</code> enhancement of package management
  capabilities.  In a rather transparent way, you can find, download and
  install dependencies; you can switch between multiple versions of a
  package, all of which are installed on the same system; you can
  declare requirements for specific versions of packages; and you can
  update to the latest versions of packages you use with a simple
  command.  The most impressive part of all this is perhaps that fact
  that you can even utilize packages whose developers have done nothing
  whatsoever to consider <code>setuptools</code> compatibility.  Let's take a look.
</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
 <p>
  The utility <code>ez_setup.py</code> is a simple script that will bootstraps the
  rest of <code>setuptools</code>.  Slightly confusingly, the <code>easy_install</code> script
  that comes with the full <code>setuptools</code> package does the same thing as
  <code>ez_setup.py</code>.  The former assumes <code>setuptools</code> is already installed,
  however, so skips the behind-the-scenes installation.  Both versions
  accept the same arguments and switches.
</p>
<p>
  The first step in the process is simply downloading the small script
  <code>ez_setup.py</code>, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Downloading the bootstrap script</h4><pre>
% wget -q http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

</pre></div><p>
  From there, you may run the script without any arguments to install
  the rest of <code>setuptools</code> (if you do not do this as a separate step, it
  will stil get done the first time you install some other package).
  You should see something similar to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Bootstrapping setuptools</h4><pre>

</pre></div><p>
  All done.  That's all you need to do to make sure <code>setuptools</code> is
  installed on your system.
</p>
<h3>Installing Packages</h3>
 <p>
  For many Python packages, all you need to do so install them is pass
  their name as a parameter to <code>ez_setup.py</code> or <code>easy_install</code>.  Now
  that we have bootstrap loaded <code>setuptools</code>, we might as well use the
  internally simpler <code>easy_install</code> (though it makes little difference
  which you choose to use in practice).
</p>
<p>
  For example, let us say you want to install the package SQLObject.
  This can be as simple as the following.  Notice in the below messages
  that SQLObject turned out to depend on a package FormEncode; luckily,
  it is all taken care of for us:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Installing a typical package</h4><pre>

</pre></div><p>
  As you can see from the messages, <code>easy_install</code> looks for metadata
  information about the package at the <code>www.python.org/pypi</code> site, then
  finds the location for the actual download (in this case the <code>egg</code>
  archive lives right at <code>cheeseshop.python.org</code>; more on eggs soon).
</p>
<p>
  You can do more than just install the latest version of a package, as
  is default.  If you like, you can give <code>easy_install</code> specific version
  requirements.  Let us try to install a post-beta version of SQLObject:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Installing a minimum version of a package </h4><pre>
% easy_install 'SQLObject&gt;=1.0'
Searching for SQLObject&gt;=1.0
Reading http://www.python.org/pypi/SQLObject/
Reading http://sqlobject.org
No local packages or download links found for SQLObject&gt;=1.0
error: Could not find suitable distribution for É
  ÉRequirement.parse('SQLObject&gt;=1.0')

</pre></div><p>
  At least at the time this article was written, SQLObject only exists
  up to version 0.7.0, so there is nothing to install.
</p>
<h3>Installing "naive" Packages</h3>
 <p>
  The package SQLObject is already "setuptools aware"; but what if we
  want to install a package whose author has not given thought to
  <code>setuptools</code>? For example, before this article, I never used
  <code>setuptools</code> with my "Gnosis Utilities". Still, let us try installing
  the package, knowing only the HTTP (or FTP, SVN, CVS) location where
  it lives (<code>setuptools</code> knows all these protocols).  My download
  website has archives of the various Gnosis Utilities versions, named
  in a usual versioning fashion:

  Happily for us, <code>easy_install</code> figured everything out for us.  It
  looked in the given download directory, identified the highest
  available version number, unpackaged the archive, and repackaged it as
  an "egg" that was installed.  Importing <code>gnosis</code> now works fine in an
  script.  But suppose I now I need to test a script against a specific
  earlier version of Gnosis Utilities? Easy enough:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Installing a particular version of a "naive" package</h4><pre>

</pre></div><p>
  There are actually two versions of Gnosis Utilities installed now,
  with 1.2.0 the active version.  Switching the active version back to
  1.2.1 is also easy:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Changing the "active" version system-wide</h4><pre>

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, this only makes one version active at a time.  But an
  individual script can choose the version it wants to use it it likes
  by putting two lines at the top of your script, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using a package version within a script</h4><pre>
from pkg_resources import require
require("Gnosis_Utils==1.2.0")

</pre></div><p>
  With this stated requirement, <code>setuptools</code> will add the specific
  version (or the latest available, if the greater-than comparison is
  specified) when an <code>import</code> statement is run.
</p>
<h3>Making A Package More Aware Of Setuptools</h3>
 <p>
  We would like to let users install Gnosis Utilities without even
  knowing it's download directory. This <em>almost</em> works simply because
  Gnosis Utilities has an information listing at the Python Cheeseshop.
  Unfortunately, not having considered <code>setuptools</code>, I had created a
  slight "impedence mismatch" in my entry for Gnosis Utilities at
  &lt<a href="http://www.python.org/pypi/Gnosis%20Utilities/1.2.1&gt;.">http://www.python.org/pypi/Gnosis%20Utilities/1.2.1&gt;.</a> Specifically,
  the archives are named on a pattern like <code>Gnosis_Utils-N.N.N.tar.gz</code>
  (also archived as <code>.zip</code> and <code>.tar.bz2</code>, and the last few versions as
  win32.exe installers, all of which <code>setuptools</code> is equally happy
  with). But the project name on Cheeseshop is spelled slightly
  differently as "Gnosis Utilities". Oh well, a quick administrative
  version change at Cheeseshop created
  &lt<a href="http://www.python.org/pypi/Gnosis_Utils/1.2.1-a&gt;">http://www.python.org/pypi/Gnosis_Utils/1.2.1-a&gt;</a> as a post-release
  version. Nothing was changed in the distribution archives themselves,
  just a little bit of metadata at Cheeseshop. With the slight tweak, we
  might use an even simpler install (note that for testing purposes I
  ran an intervening <code>easy_install -m</code> to remove the installed package).
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Easy addition of setuptools awareness</h4><pre>
% easy_install Gnosis_Utils

Best match: Gnosis-Utils 1.2.1
Downloading [...]

</pre></div><p>
  I omit the completion of the process, since it is identical to what we
  have seen.  The only change is that <code>easy_install</code> looks on Cheeseshop
  (i.e. <code>www.python.org/pypi/</code>) for metadata about a package matching
  the name specified, and uses that to look for an actual download
  location.  In this case, the listed <code>.ANNOUNCE</code> file does not contain
  anything helpful, but <code>easy_install</code> is happy to keep looking at the
  other listed URL as well, which proves to be a download directory.
</p>
<h3>All About Eggs</h3>
 <p>
  An egg is a bundle that contains all the package data.  In the ideal
  case, an egg is a zip-compressed file with all the necessary package
  files.  But in some cases, <code>setuptools</code> decides (or is told by
  switches) that a package should not be zip-compressed.  In those
  cases, an egg is simply an uncompressed subdirectory instead, but with
  the same contents.  The single file version is handy for transporting,
  and saves a little bit of disk-space, but an egg directory is
  functionally and organizationally identical.  Java users who have
  worked with jars will find eggs very familiar.
</p>
<p>
  You may use an egg simply by pointing <code>PYTHONPATH</code> or <code>sys.path</code> at
  it, then importing as you normally would, thanks to the import hook
  changes in recent versions of Python (you need 2.3.5+ or 2.4). If you
  wish to take this approach, you do not need to bother with
  <code>setuptools</code> or <code>ez_setup.py</code> at all. For example, I put an egg for
  the PyYAML package in a working directory that I used for this
  article. I can utilize the package as easily as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Eggs on the PYTHONPATH</h4><pre>
% export PYTHONPATH=~/work/dW/PyYAML-3.01-py2.4.egg
% python -c 'import yaml; print yaml.dump({"foo":"bar",1:[2,3]})'
1: [2, 3]
foo: bar

</pre></div><p>
  However, this sort of manipulation of the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> (or of
  <code>sys.path</code> within a script or Python shell session) is a bit fragile.
  Discovery of eggs is probably best handled within some newish magic
  <code>.pth</code> files.  Any <code>.pth</code> files found in <code>site-packages/</code> or on the
  <code>PYTHONPATH</code> are parsed for additional imports to perform, in a very
  similar manner to the way directories in those locations that might
  contain packages are examined.  If you handle package management with
  <code>setuptools</code>, a file called <code>easy-install.pth</code> is modified when
  packages are installed, upgraded, removed, etc.  But you may call your
  <code>.pth</code> files whatever you like (as long as they have the extension).
  For example, here is my <code>easy-install.pth</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Pth files as configuration of Egg locations</h4><pre>
% cat /sw/lib/python2.4/site-packages/easy-install.pth
import sys; sys.__plen = len(sys.path)
setuptools-0.6b1-py2.4.egg
SQLObject-0.7.0-py2.4.egg
FormEncode-0.5.1-py2.4.egg
Gnosis_Utils-1.2.1-py2.4.egg
import sys; new=sys.path[sys.__plen:]; del sys.path[sys.__plen:];É
  Ép=getattr(sys,'__egginsert',0); sys.path[p:p]=new;É
  Ésys.__egginsert = p+len(new)

</pre></div><p>
  The format is a bit peculiar: it is almost, but not quite, a Python
  script.  Suffice it to say that you may add additional listed eggs in
  there; or better yet, <code>easy_install</code> will do it for you when it runs.
  You may also create as many other <code>.pth</code> files as you like under
  <code>site-packages/</code> and each may simply list the eggs to make available.
</p>
<h3>Enhancing Setup Scripts</h3>
 <p>
  The magic I showed off above of installing a <code>setuptools</code> naive
  package actually only sort-of worked in the example I showed you. That
  is, the package Gnosis_Utils got installed, but not quite completely.
  All the general functionality works, but a variety of supporting files
  were omitted when the egg was automatically generated--mostly
  documentation files with a <code>.txt</code> extension and test files with <code>.xml</code>
  extensions (but also some miscellaneous <code>README</code>, <code>.rnc</code>, <code>.rng</code>,
  <code>.xsl</code>, and whatnot scattered around the subpackages).  As it happens,
  all of these supporting files are "nice-to-have" more than they are
  strictly required.  Still, we would like to include all the supporting
  files.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>setup.py</code> script for Gnosis_Utils is quite complex, actually. As
  well as list basic metadata, in 467 lines of code, it performs a whole
  bunch of testing for Python version capabilities and bugs; works
  around glitches in old versions of <code>disutils</code>; falls back to skipping
  installation of non-supported parts (e.g. if <code>pyexpat</code> is not included
  in your Python distribution); handles OS line-ending convention
  conversion; creates multiple archive/installer types; and rebuilds the
  <code>MANIFEST</code> file in response to these tests.  Doing all this work is
  mostly thanks to the package co-maintainer, Frank McIngvale; and it
  lets Gnosis_Utils successfully install as far back as Python 1.5.1, if
  necessary (with reduced capabilities in earlier versions). The quick
  moral here is that what I am about to show you does not do as much as
  the complex <code>distutils</code> script: it simply assumes a "normal" looking
  and recent version of Python is installed. That said, it is still
  impressive just how easy <code>setuptools</code> can make an installation script.
</p>
<p>
  As a first try, let us create a <code>setup.py</code> script borrowing from the
  <code>setuptools</code> manual, and try creating an egg using it:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>A setuptools 'setup.py' script</h4><PRE>% cat setup.py
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> setuptools <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"Gnosis_Utils"</FONT>,
    version = <FONT COLOR=#115511>"1.2.2"</FONT>,
    packages = find_packages(),
)
% python setup.py -q bdist_egg
zip_safe flag <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>not</B></FONT> set; analyzing archive contents...
gnosis.__init__: module references __file__
gnosis.doc.__init__: module references __file__
gnosis.magic.__init__: module references __file__
gnosis.xml.objectify.doc.__init__: module references __file__
gnosis.xml.pickle.doc.__init__: module references __file__
gnosis.xml.pickle.test.test_zdump: module references __file__</PRE></div><p>
  This little effort works; or it sort-of works.  We really do create an
  egg with these few lines, but the egg has the same shortcoming as the
  version <code>easy_install</code> created: it lacks the support files that are
  not named <code>.py</code>.  So let us try only slightly harder:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Adding the missing package_data</h4><pre>
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = "Gnosis_Utils",
    version = "1.2.2",
    package_data = {'':['*.*']},
    packages = find_packages(),
)

</pre></div><p>
  It turns out that is all we need to do.  Of course, in practice you
  will often want to fine tune this a bit.  For example, more
  realistically, this might list, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>package_data = {'doc':['*.txt'], 'xml':['*.xml', 'relax/*.rnc']}

</pre></div><p>
  Which would mean to include the <code>.txt</code> files under the <code>doc/</code>
  subpackage, all the <code>.xml</code> files under the <code>xml/</code> subpackage, and all
  the <code>.rnc</code> files under the <code>xml/relax/</code> subpackage.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  I really only scratched the surface of the customization you can
  perform with <code>setuptools</code> aware distributions. For example, once you
  have a distribution (either the preferred egg format, or another
  archive type), you may automatically upload the archive and metadata
  to Cheeseshop with a single command.  Obviously, a complete
  <code>setup.py</code> script should contain the same detailed metadata that your
  old <code>distutils</code> scripts contained--I skipped that just for ease of
  presentation, but the argument names are compatible with <code>distutils</code>.
  It takes a little while to become fully comfortable with <code>setuptools</code>
  large set of capabilities, but it really makes both maintaining your
  own packages and installing outside packages much easier than the
  <code>distutils</code> baseline.  And if all you care about is installing
  packages, pretty much everything you need to know is contained in this
  introduction; the complexity only comes with describing your own
  packages, and that complexity is still less than required to "grok"
  <code>distutils</code>.
