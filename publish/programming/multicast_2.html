    The first installment of this series provided a general
    introduction to multicasting, and touched on some protocols
    and topologies.  We expand on topologies in this installment,
    and look at the "last mile" problem.

<h3>Routing Multicast Traffic With Dvmrp</h3>
 <p>
  When an application joins an IP multicast group G, the host OS
  issues an Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) membership
  report on the local network.  From this point it becomes the
  local routers' responsibility to locate multicast traffic for
  group G, and forward it to the local network.  How does the
  Internet assure the right traffic gets forwarded to interested
  routers?
</p>
<p>
  The first attempt to route multicast was the Distance-Vector
  Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP).  DVMRP is commonly
  implemented by "mrouted" on Unix-like operating systems.  In
  DVMRP's "flood-and-prune" model, a router maintains a list of
  interesting multicast groups for each network the router
  connect to.  When a new source S sends traffic to a group G, it
  first "floods" the entire network to establish a source based
  tree.  Then, starting with the leaves of the tree, routers that
  have no interested networks send prune messages back toward the
  root of the tree.  When things work optimally, it costs just a
  single packet from each source to each group to setup an
  optimal distribution tree.
</p>
<p>
  If your network has only a few dozen routers, and only a few
  dozen multicast groups active at any given time, DVMRP is a
  reasonable solution.  And if your network hardware doesnt
  implement DVMRP, you can setup a tunnel and run mrouted on a
  Linux or BSD machine.
</p>
<p>
  The global Internet, however, outgrew the DVMRP backbone many
  years ago.  The requirement that every router maintain state
  for every sender simply does not scale.  In addition, DVMRP
  shares some basic limitations with its unicast sibling <code>RIP</code>:
  rather than distribute actual network topology information,
  these protocols propagate digested information about which
  network addresses or multicast groups should be sent in which
  general direction.  Rita Perlman called this "routing on
  rumor."  DVMRP and RIP give rise to a host of well-known
  network pathologies, including very slow convergence time after
  network change.
</p>
<h3>Better Scaling Models</h3>
 <p>
  In 1997, Tony Ballardie proposed what is to-date the most
  elegant multicast routing solution.  Core Based Trees (CBT)
  creates a bidirectional tree for each multicast group, and
  distribute the roots of these trees throughout the Internet.
  Routers need only keep state information for groups that are of
  local interest; traffic for unknown groups is simply directed
  toward the the groups' <code>core</code>.  CBT centralizes the problem of
  multicast routing in a distributed directory of core locations.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, CBT came out at the same time as Protocol
  Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).  Despite its
  shortcomings PIM has become the de facto standard for Internet
  multicast because PIM is the solution Cisco implemented.
</p>
<p>
  PIM has both source based trees (traffic flows directly from
  source to listeners) and shared trees (traffic is directed
  through intermediary Rendezvous Points (RPs)).  Like DVMRP, RPs
  have to keep information about every multicast sender on the
  entire Internet.  Fortunately, the other PIM routers can forget
  this information.  A PIM router requests a multicast group by
  sending a message to the local RP.  This sets up a shared tree
  to the RP, and multicast traffic will start to flow.
</p>
<p>
  For single-homed networks with a single uplink, PIM was a great
  improvement over DVMRP.  By the late 1990s, however,
  flood-and-prune created a maelstrom of traffic that could not
  be effectively pruned.  PIM produces very little traffic unless
  a multicast group is actually requested.
</p>
<p>
  PIM-SM has a flood-and-prune sibling, PIM-Dense Mode (PIM-DM).
  PIM-DM has been largely eclipsed by Multicast Source
  Distribution Protocol (MSDP) which allows PIM rendezvous points
  to more efficiently share information about known senders.  But
  MSDP is a temporary hack to hold the Any Source Multicast
  backbone together long enough for Border Gateway Multicast
  Protocol (BGMP) to be developed, debugged, and deployed.
  Maybe--some network developers think that BGMP is too complex
  to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, PIM-SM works quite well for Single Source
  Multicast (SSM) since the source is known routers can build a
  source based tree, and bypass the Rendezvous Points all
  together.
</p>
<h3>Multicasting To The "last Mile" With Igmp Proxy</h3>
 <p>
  Most core routers on the Internet today support multicast, and
  many ISPs run multicast traffic across the backbone.
  Unfortunately, getting multicast all the way to end users is
  not so simple.  Most customer equipment (e.g.  DSL and cable
  modems) cannot handle PIM, so their only option is IGMP proxy.
  Unfortunately, IGMP proxy can wreak havok with upstream
  connections.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose you start up a multicast video conference on your LAN,
  with no participants outside your local network.  If you ran a
  full multicast routing protocol on your Internet gateway, it
  would tell your ISP about the multicast session.  With no
  participants (group members) on the Internet at large, the
  distribution tree is pruned to your local network.  Your link
  to the Internet stays free of unnecessary traffic.  Should
  someone else on the Internet join, the multicast traffic will
  then flow over your Internet connection.
</p>
<p>
  With IGMP proxy, however, there is no mechanism to inform your
  router that no one else on the Internet is interested in your
  multicast.  Consequently, your Internet connection becomes
  swamped with potentially unnecessary traffic.
</p>
<p>
  It may seem like a bad idea to allow just anyone to join your
  video conference.  But that is the way the Internet is supposed
  to work; physical location should not matter.  If the
  conference is private, the proper approach is encryption; even
  though anyone can join, they won't be able to make sense of the
  data without the decryption key.
</p>
<h3>A Better Last Mile Protocol</h3>
 <p>
  Multimedia is currently the primary application for multicast.
  The bandwidth requirements for multimedia limit its market to
  high speed DSL, cable modem, and traditional leased line
  customers.  Moreover, many business customers associate
  multimedia with non-productive entertainment.  As a result,
  many ISPs have back-burnered multicast.  Those Internet users
  who want to experiment with multicast have been forced to use
  specialized (usually higher priced) ISPs, or construct Rube
  Goldberg-esque tunnels with people and institutions that
  support MBone access.
</p>
<p>
  Automatic Multicast Tunnels (AMT) is a recent instantiation of
  an idea Tony Ballardie proposed to the IETF in 2000.  AMT
  allows any host or network to receive both Any Source and
  Single Source multicast through a User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  tunnel, even from behind a firewall.
</p>
<p>
  On the client end is an "AMT gateway," i.e. a router or a
  single Intel PC host.  Once the gateway has located an "AMT
  relay" (which may be a PC rather than a traditional router), it
  periodically sends IGMP message, in much the same way it would
  to request native multicast traffic from a local router.  The
  IGMP messages are encapsulated in UDP, so they create
  connection state on any packet filtering firewalls they pass
  through.  The mechanism is wonderfully simple and allows anyone
  on the Internet to create a dynamic tunnel to download
  multicast data streams.  AMT may also allow end users to send
  Single Source multicast data, once some details are worked out.
</p>
<p>
  An ingenious aspect of AMT is the way in which AMT gateways
  locate an AMT relay.  "Anycast" is a mechanism wherein a sender
  transmits data to the single nearest member of a group of
  network nodes.  Each node, announces to the local routing
  protocol that it is a gateway to the special anycast address A;
  normal unicast dynamic routing takes care of the rest.  Packets
  destined for address A will naturally find their way to the
  nearest node in the anycast group.  This mechanism is a simple
  way to distribute load among a group of machines providing a
  service, such as DNS.
</p>
<p>
  AMT gateways and hosts only use anycast as a means to discover
  the "real" address of the nearest anycast relay point.  This
  mechanism helps spread the load among all the AMT relays on the
  Internet.
</p>
<p>
  Using AMT, an ISP can deploy a single AMT relay to provide
  service to all its customers.  Before that relay becomes
  overloaded--or if the tunnel traffic it generates causes an
  undue load on certain links in the network--the ISP can deploy
  additional AMT relays, both to distribute the server load and
  to lessen the network load.  Since the AMT relays fetch data
  using native multicast, only their outgoing tunnel traffic that
  taxes the network.
</p>
<h3>Whither Multicast?</h3>
 <p>
  AMT allows otherwise unicast-only Internet users to receive
  multicast data streams; AMT may prove exactly what is necessary
  to generate enough demand for multicast that multicast becomes
  a standard component of Internet service.
</p>
<p>
  In the final installment, we will introduce the concept of
  "reliable multicast" and discuss multicast applications in some
  more detail.
