    Python 2.2 will introduce a new construct, accompanied by a 
    new keyword.  The construct is <em>generators</em>, the keyword is 
    <code>yield</code>. Generators make possible several new, powerful, and 
    expressive programming idioms, but are also a little bit hard 
    to get one's mind around at first glance.  This article 
    provides a gentle introduction to generators--and also to the 
    related introduction of iterators.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3> 
 <p> 
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted 
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear 
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics. 
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you 
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability 
  between platforms. 
</p> 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
 <p> 
  Welcome to the world of exotic flow control.  With Python 2.2, 
  programmers will get some new options for how to make programs 
  tick that were not available--or at least not as convenient--in 
  earlier Python versions. 
</p> 
<p> 
  While what Python 2.2 gives us is not quite as mind-melting as 
  the full continuations and microthreads that are possible in 
  Stackless Python, generators and iterators do something a bit 
  different from traditional functions and classes. 
</p> 
<p> 
  Let us consider iterators first, since they are simpler to 
  understand. Basically, and iterator is just an object that has 
  a <code>.next()</code> method.  Well, that is not quite true; but it is 
  close.  Actually, most iterator contexts want an object that 
  will generate an iterator when the new <code>iter()</code> builtin 
  function is applied to it.  All one needs to do to have a user 
  defined class (that has the requisite <code>.next()</code> method) return 
  an iterator is to have a <code>__iter__()</code> method return <code>self</code>. 
  The examples will make this all clear.  An iterator's <code>.next()</code> 
  method might decide to raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception if the 
  iteration has a logical termination. 
</p> 
<p> 
  A generator is a little more complicated and general.  But the 
  most typical use of generators will be for defining iterators; 
  so some of the subtlety is not always worth worrying about.  A 
  generator is a function that remembers the point in the 
  function body where it last returned.  Calling a generator 
  function a second (or n'th) time jumps into the middle of the 
  function, with all local variables intact from the last 
  invocation. 
</p> 
<p> 
  In some ways, a generator is like the closures which were 
  discussed in the installments of this column discussing 
  functional programming.  Like a closure, a generator 
  "remembers" the state of its data.  But a generator goes a bit 
  further than a closure inasmuch as a generator also "remembers" 
  its position within flow-control constructs (which in 
  imperative programming is something more than just data 
  values).  Continuations are still move general since they let 
  one jump arbitrarily between execution frames, rather than 
  returning always to the immediate caller's context (as a 
  generator does). 
</p> 
<p> 
  Fortunately, using a generator is much less work than 
  is understanding all the conceptual issues of program flow and 
  state.  In fact, after very little practice, generators seem as 
  obvious as ordinary functions. 
</p> 
<h3>Taking A Random Walk</h3> 
 <p> 
  For purpose of this explanation, let me pose a fairly simple 
  problem that we can solve in several ways--both new and old. 

  Suppose we want a stream of positive random numbers less than 
  one that obey a backward-looking constraint.  Specifically, we 
  want each successive number to be at least 0.4 more or less 
  than the last one.  Moreover, the stream itself is not 
  infinite, but rather ends after a random number of steps.  For 
  the examples, we will simply end the stream when a number less 
  than 0.1 is produced.  The constraints described are a bit like 
  one might find in a "random walk" algorithm, with the end 
  condition resembling a "statisficing" or "local minimum" 
  result--but certainly the requirements are simpler than most 
  real world ones. 
</p> 
<p> 
  In Python 2.1 or earlier, we have a few approaches to solving 
  our problem.  One approach is to simply produce and return a 
  list of numbers in the stream.  This might look like: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>RandomWalk_List.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> random 
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="randomwalk_list"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> randomwalk_list</B></FONT></A>(): 
    last, rand = 1, random.random() <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># init candidate elements</FONT> 
    nums = []                       <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># empty list</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> rand &gt; 0.1:               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># threshhold terminator</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> abs(last-rand) &gt;= 0.4:   <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># accept the number</FONT> 
            last = rand 
            nums.append(rand)       <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># add latest candidate to nums</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>: 
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'*'</FONT>,              <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># display the rejection</FONT> 
        rand = random.random()      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># new candidate</FONT> 
    nums.append(rand)               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># add the final small element</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> nums</PRE></div><p> 
  Utilizing this function is as simple as: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Iterate over Random Walk List</h4><pre> 
for num in randomwalk_list(): 
    print num, 
 
</pre></div><p> 
  There are a few notable limitations to the above approach.  The 
  specific example is exceedingly unlikely to produce huge lists; 
  but just by making the threshhold terminator more stringent, we 
  could create arbitrarily large streams (of random exact size, 
  but of anticipatable order-of-magnitude).  At a certain point, 
  memory and performance issues can make this approach 
  undesirable and unnecessary.  This same concern got <code>xrange()</code> 
  and <code>xreadlines()</code> added to Python in earlier versions.  More 
  significantly, many streams depend on external events, and yet 
  should be processed as each element is available.  For example, 
  a stream might listen to a port, or wait for user inputs. 
  Trying to create a complete list out of the stream is simply 
  not an option in these cases. 
</p> 
<p> 
  One trick available in Python 2.1 and earlier is to use a 
  "static" function-local variable to remember things about the 
  last invocation of a function.  Obviously, global variables 
  could do the same job, but they cause the familiar problems 
  with pollution of the global namespace, and allow mistakes due 
  to non-locality.  You might be surprised here if you are 
  unfamiliar with the trick--Python does not have an "official" 
  static scoping declaration.  However, if named parameters are 
  given mutable default values, the parameters can act as 
  persistent memories of previous invocations.  Lists, 
  specifically, are handy mutable objects that can conveniently 
  even hold multiple values. 
</p> 
<p> 
  Using a "static" approach, we can write a function like: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>RandomWalk_Static.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> random 
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="randomwalk_static"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> randomwalk_static</B></FONT></A>(last=[1]):    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># init the "static" var(s)</FONT> 
    rand = random.random()          <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># init a candidate value</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> last[0] &lt; 0.1:               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># threshhold terminator</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> None                 <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># end-of-stream flag</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> abs(last[0]-rand) &lt; 0.4:  <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># look for usable candidate</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'*'</FONT>,                  <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># display the rejection</FONT> 
        rand = random.random()      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># new candidate</FONT> 
    last[0] = rand                  <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># update the "static" var</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> rand</PRE></div><p> 
  This function is quite memory-friendly.  All it needs to 
  remember is one previous value, and all it returns is a single 
  number (not a big list of them).  And a function similar to 
  this could return successive values that depended (partly or 
  wholly) on external events.  On the down side, utilizing this 
  function is somewhat less concise, and considerably less 
  elegant: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Iterate over Static Random Walk</h4><pre> 
num = randomwalk_static() 
while num is not None: 
    print num, 
    num = randomwalk_static() 
 
 
</pre></div><h3>New Ways Of Walking</h3> 
 <p> 
  "Under the hood", Python 2.2 sequences are all iterators.  The 
  familiar Python idiom <code>for elem in lst:</code> now actually asks 
  <code>lst</code> to produce an iterator.  The <code>for</code> loop then repeatedly 
  calls the <code>.next()</code> method of this iterator until it encounters 
  a <code>StopIteration</code> exception.  Luckily, Python programmers do 
  not need to know what is happening here, since all the familiar 
  builtin types produce their iterators automatically.  In fact, 
  now dictionaries have the methods <code>.iterkeys()</code>, <code>.iteritems()</code> 
  and <code>.itervalues()</code> to produce iterators; the first is what 
  gets used in the new idiom <code>for key in dct:</code>.  Likewise, the 
  new idiom <code>for line in file:</code> is supported via an iterator that 
  calls <code>.readline()</code>. 
</p> 
<p> 
  But given what <em>is</em> actually happening within the Python 
  interpreter, it becomes obvious to use custom classes that 
  produce their own iterators rather than exclusively use the 
  iterators of builtin types.  A custom class that enables both 
  the direct usage of <code>randomwalk_list()</code> and the 
  element-at-a-time parsimony of <code>randomwalk_static</code> is 
  straightforward: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>RandomWalk_Iter.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> random 
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>class</B></FONT><A NAME="randomwalk_iter"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> randomwalk_iter</B></FONT></A>:

        self.last = 1               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># init the prior value</FONT> 
        self.rand = random.random() <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># init a candidate value</FONT> 
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="__iter__"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> __iter__</B></FONT></A>(self):

    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="next"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> next</B></FONT></A>(self): 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> self.rand &lt; 0.1:         <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># threshhold terminator</FONT> 
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>raise</B></FONT> StopIteration     <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># end of iteration</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:                       <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># look for usable candidate</FONT> 
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> abs(self.last-self.rand) &lt; 0.4: 
                <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'*'</FONT>,          <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># display the rejection</FONT> 
                self.rand = random.random() <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># new candidate</FONT> 
            self.last = self.rand   <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># update prior value</FONT> 
            <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> self.rand</PRE></div><p> 
  Use of this custom iterator looks exactly the same as for a 
  true list generated by a function: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Iterate with Random Walk Class</h4><pre> 
for num in randomwalk_iter(): 
    print num, 
 
</pre></div><p> 
  In fact, even the idiom <code>if elem in iterator</code> is supported, 
  which lazily only tries as many elements of the iterator as are 
  needed to determine the truth value (if it winds up false, it 
  needs to try all the elements, of course). 
</p> 
<h3>Leaving A Trail Of Crumbs</h3> 
 <p> 
  The above approaches are fine for the problem at hand.  But 
  none of them scale very well to the case where a routine 
  creates a large number of local variables along the way, and 
  winds its way into a nest of loops and conditionals.  If an 
  iterator class, or a function with static (or global) variables 
  depends on multiple data states, two problems come up.  One is 
  the mundane matter of creating multiple instance attributes or 
  static list elements to hold each of the data values.  The far 
  more important problem is figuring out how to get back to 
  exactly the relevant part of the flow logic that corresponds to 
  the data states.  It is awfully easy to forget about the 
  interaction and codependence of different data. 
</p> 
<p> 
  Generators simply bypass the whole problem.  A generator 
  "returns" with the new keyword <code>yield</code>, but "remembers" the 
  exact point of execution where it returned.  Next time the 
  generator is called, it picks up where it left before--both in 
  terms of function flow and in terms of variable values. 
</p> 
<p> 
  One does not directly <em>write</em> a generator in Python 2.2+. 
  Instead, one writes a function that, when called, returns a 
  generator.  This might seem odd, but "function factories" are a 
  familiar feature of Python, and "generator factories" are an 
  obvious conceptual extension of this.  What makes a function a 
  generator factory in Python 2.2+ is the presence of one or more 
  <code>yield</code> statements somewhere in its body.  If <code>yield</code> occurs, 
  <code>return</code> must only occur without any accompanying return value. 
  A better choice, however, is to arrange the function bodies so 
  that execution just "falls off the end" after all the <code>yield's 
  are accomplished.  But if a 'return</code> is encountered, it causes 
  the produced generator to raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception 
  rather than yield further values. 
</p> 
<p> 
  In my own opinion, the choice of syntax for generator factories 
  was somewhat poorly chosen.  A <code>yield</code> statment can occur well 
  into the body of a function, and one might be unable to 
  determine that a function is destined to act as a generator 
  factory anywhere within the first N lines of a function.  The 
  same thing could, of course, be true of a function factory--but 
  being a function factory doesn't change the actual <strong>syntax</strong> of 
  a function body (and a function body is allowed to sometimes 
  return a plain value; albeit probably not out of good design). 
  To my mind, a new keyword--such as <code>generator</code> in place of 
  <code>def</code> would have been a better choice. 
</p> 
<p> 
  Quibbles over syntax aside, generators have the good manners to 
  automatically act as iterators when called on to do so. 
  Nothing like the <code>.__iter__()</code> method of classes is needed 
  here.  Every <code>yield</code> encountered becomes a return value for 
  generator's <code>.next()</code> method.  Let's look at the simplest 
  generator to make things clear: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Simplest Possible Python 2.2 Generator</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> __future__ <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> generators

  Let us put a generator to work in our sample problem: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>RandomWalk_Generator.py</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> __future__ <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> generators   <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># only needed for Python 2.2</FONT>

    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> rand &gt; 0.1:               <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># threshhold terminator</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'*'</FONT>,                  <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># display the rejection</FONT> 
        <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> abs(last-rand) &gt;= 0.4:   <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># accept the number</FONT> 
            last = rand             <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># update prior value</FONT> 
            yield rand              <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># return AT THIS POINT</FONT> 
        rand = random.random()      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># new candidate</FONT> 
    yield rand                      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># return the final small element</PRE></FONT></div><p> 
  The simplicity of this definition is quite appealing.  One can 
  utilize the generator either manually, or as an iterator.  In 
  the manual case, the generator can be passed around a program, 
  and called wherever and whenever needed (which is quite 
  flexible).  A simple example of the manual case is: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Manual use of Random Walk Generator</h4><pre> 
gen = randomwalk_generator() 
try: 
    while 1: print gen.next(), 
except StopIteration: 
    pass 
 
</pre></div><p> 
  Most frequently, however, one is likely to use a generator as 
  an iterator, which is even more concise (and again looks just 
  like an old-fashioned sequence): 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Random Walk Generator as Interator</h4><pre> 
for num in randomwalk_generator(): 
    print_short(num) 
 
 
</pre></div><h3>Yielding</h3> 
 <p> 
  It will take a little while for Python programmers to become 
  familiar with the ins-and-outs of generators.  The added power 
  of such a simple construct is surprising at first; and even 
  quite accomplished programmers (like the Python developers 
  themselves) will continue to discover subtle new techniques 
  using generators for some time, I predict. 
</p> 
<p> 
  To close, let me present one more generator example that comes 
  from the <code>test_generators.py</code> module distributed with Python 
  2.2.  Suppose you have a tree object, and want to search its 
  leaves in left-to-right order.  Using tradition 
  state-monitoring variables getting a class or function just 
  right is difficult.  Using generators makes it almost laughably 
  easy: 
</p> 
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # A recursive generator that generates Tree leaves in in-order. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def inorder(t): 
...     if t: 
...         for x in inorder(t.left): 
...             yield x 
...         yield t.label 
...         for x in inorder(t.right): 
...             yield x
