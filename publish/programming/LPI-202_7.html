    Welcome to "Network Troubleshooting", the final part of seven
    tutorials on Linux networking. The material in this tutorial
    revisits what you learned in earlier tutorials of the LPI 202
    series. All the basic tools were covered earlier, but this tutorial
    looks at many of them again, with a particular eye towards fixing
    problems using those tools.

<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  </strong> Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  <strong> Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  </strong> Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  <strong> Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  </strong> Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)
</p>
<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Network Troubleshooting", the final part of seven
  tutorials on Linux networking. The material in this tutorial revisits
  what you learned in earlier tutorials of the LPI 202 series. All the
  basic tools were covered earlier, but this tutorial looks at many of
  them again, with a particular eye towards fixing problems using those
  tools.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About network troubleshooting
</h3>
 <p>
  To troubleshooting a network configuration, you should be aware of
  several tools discussed in these tutorials, and also with several
  configuration files that affect network status and behavior.  A
  summary of the main tools and configuration files you should
  familiarize yourself with is contained in this tutorial.  Perhaps
  somewhat arbitrarily, the tools discussed in this troubleshooting
  tutorial are divided according to whether a given tool applies more to
  configuration of a network in the first place or to diagnosis of
  network problems.  Of course, in practice, those elements are rarely
  entirely separate.
</p>
<h3>Resources
</h3>
 <p>
  For the subjects addressed in this tutorial, possibly the best
  resource for further information is the rest of this tutorial series
  as a whole.  Nearly all the topics addressed here are detailed further
  in preceding tutorials.
</p>
<p>
  For thoroughly in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
 <a href="http://www.tldp.org/.">http://www.tldp.org/.</a>  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's <cite>TCP/IP Network
  Administration</cite>, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).
</p>
<p>
  Quite a few people have written step-by-step guides to fixing a broken
  Linux network.  One that looks good is "Simple Network Troubleshooting"
  at:<a href="http://www.siliconvalleyccie.com/linux-hn/network-trouble.htm.">http://www.siliconvalleyccie.com/linux-hn/network-trouble.htm.</a>
  Debian's similar quick guide is "How To Set Up A Linux Network" at:
 <a href="http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm.">http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm.</a>  Since tutorials come and go,
  and are updated on different schedules as distributions and commands
  change, simply using an internet search engine to find currently
  available sources is a good idea.
</p>
<h3>Network Configuration Tools</h3>
 <h3>'ifconfig'</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial on Topic 205 (Network Configuration) discusses <code>ifconfig</code>
  in greater detail.  This utility will both report on the current
  status of network interfaces, and will let you modify the
  configuration of those interaces.  In most cases, if <em>something</em> is
  wrong with a network--as in, a particular machine does not appear to
  access the network at all--running <code>ifconfig</code> with no options is
  usually the first step you should take.  If this fails to report
  active interfaces, you can be pretty sure that the local machine
  itself has a configuration problem.  "Active" in this case means, at
  minimum, that it shows an IP address assigned; and in most cases, you
  will expect to see a number of packets in the RX and TX lines, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>eth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C0:9F:21:2F:25
        inet addr:192.168.216.90  Bcast:66.98.217.255  Mask:255.255.254.0
        UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
        RX packets:6193735 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
        TX packets:6982479 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

</pre></div><p>
  Attempting to activate an interface with, e.g. <code>ifconfig eth0 up ...</code>
  is a good first step to try to see if an interface <em>can</em> be activated
  (filling in additional options in the line, in many cases).
</p>
<h3>'route'</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial on Topic 205 (Network Configuration) discusses <code>route</code>
  in greater detail.  There is to much to cover in detail in this
  debugging discussion, but this utility lets you both view and modify
  the routing tables currently in effect for a local machine and a local
  network.  Using <code>route</code> you may add and delete routes, set netmasks
  and gateways, and perform various other tweaking.  For the most part,
  calls to <code>route</code> should be performed in initialization scripts, but in
  attempting to diagnose and fix problems, experimenting with routing
  options can help (successes then to be copied to appropriate
  initialization scripts for later use).
</p>
<h3>'hostname'</h3>
 <p>
  This utility also has aliases <code>domainname</code>, <code>nodename</code>,
  <code>dnsdomainname</code>, <code>nisdomainname</code> and <code>ypdomainname</code> to utilize
  different aspects of the utility.  You may get at all these
  capabilities with switches to <code>hostname</code> itself.
</p>
<p>
  <code>hostname</code> is used to either set or display the current host, domain
  or node name of the system. These names are used by many of the
  networking programs to identify the machine. The domain name is also
  used by NIS/YP.
</p>
<h3>'dmesg'</h3>
 <p>
  The utility <code>dmesg</code> allows you to examine kernel log messages, and
  works in cooperation with <code>syslogd</code>.  Any kernel process, including
  those related to networking are best accessed using the <code>dmesg</code>
  utility, often filtered using other tools such as <code>grep</code>, as well as
  switches to <code>dmesg</code>.
</p>
<h3>Manually setting ARP
</h3>
 <p>
  You almost never need or want to mess with automatically discovered
  ARP records.  However, in debugging situations, you may want to
  manually configure the ARP cache.  The utility <code>arp</code> lets you do this.
  The key options in the <code>arp</code> utility <code>-d</code> for delete, <code>-s</code> for set,
  and <code>-f</code> for set-from-file (default file is <code>/etc/ethers</code>).
</p>
<p>
  For example, suppose that communication with a specific IP address on
  the local network is erratic or unreliable. One possible cause of this
  situation is if multiple machines are incorrectly configured to use
  the same IP address. When an ARP request is broadcast over the
  ethernet network, it is indeterminate which machine will respond first
  with an ARP reply. The end result might be the data packets will at
  one time be delivered to one machine, and at a later time to a
  different machine.
</p>
<p>
  Using <code>arp -n</code> to debug the actual IP assignment is a first step.  If
  you can determine that the IP address at issue does not map to the
  correct ethernet device, that is a strong clue about what is going on.
  But beyond that somewhat random detection, you can force the right ARP
  mapping using the <code>arp -s</code> (or <code>-f</code>) option.  Set an IP to map to the
  actual ethernet device it should; manually configured mapping will not
  expire unless specifically set to do so using the <code>temp</code> flag.  If a
  manual ARP mapping fixes the data loss problem, this is a strong sign
  the problem is over-assigned IP addresses.
</p>
<h3>Network Diagnostic Tools</h3>
 <h3>'netstat'</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial on Topic 205 (Network Configuration) discusses <code>netstat</code>
  in greater detail. This utility will display a variety of information
  on network connections, routing tables, interface statitics,
  masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.  Among other
  things, <code>netstat</code> will provide fairly detailed statistics on packets
  that have been handled in various ways.
</p>
<p>
  The manpage for <code>netstat</code> provides information on the wide range of
  swtiches and options available.  This utility is a good general
  purpose tool for digging into details of the status of networking on
  the local machine.
</p>
<h3>'ping'</h3>
 <p>
  A good starting point in finding out if you can connect to a given
  host from the current machine (by either IP number or symbolic name),
  is the utility <code>ping</code>.  As well as establishing that a route exists at
  all--including the resolution of names via DNS or other means, if a
  symbolic name is used, <code>ping</code> gives you information on round-trip
  times that may be informative of network congestion or routing delays.
  Sometimes <code>ping</code> will indicate a percentage of dropped packets, but in
  practical use, you almost always see either 100% or 0% of packets lost
  by <code>ping</code> requests.
</p>
<h3>'traceroute'</h3>
 <p>
  The utility <code>traceroute</code> is a bit like a <code>ping</code> "on steroids".  Rather
  than simply report the fact that a route exists to a given host,
  <code>traceroute</code> will report complete details on all the hops taken along
  the way, including the timing of each router.  Routes may change over
  time, either because of dynamic changes in the internet, or because of
  routing changes you have implemented locally.  At a given moment
  though, <code>traceroute</code> shows you an actual followed path, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ traceroute google.com
traceroute: Warning: google.com has multiple addresses; using 64.233.187.99
traceroute to google.com (64.233.187.99), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets

 9  64.233.187.99 (64.233.187.99)  14.816 ms  14.913 ms  14.775 ms

</pre></div><h3>'host', <code>nslookup</code> And 'dig'</h3>
 <p>
  All three of the utilities <code>host</code>, <code>nslookup</code> and <code>dig</code> are used for
  querying DNS entries, and largely overlap in capabilities. Generally,
  <code>nslookup</code> enhanced <code>host</code>, and <code>dig</code> in turn enhanced <code>nslookup</code>,
  though none of the three are exactly backward or forward compatible
  with each other. All the tools rely on the same underlying kernel
  facilities, so reported results shoudl be consistent in all cases
  (except where level of detail differs). For example, each of the three
  is used to query "google.com"
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ host google.com
google.com has address 64.233.187.99
google.com has address 64.233.167.99
google.com has address 72.14.207.99

$ nslookup google.com

</pre></div><h3>Network Configuration Files</h3>
 <h3>'/etc/network/<code> And </code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/'</h3>
 <p>
  The directory <code>/etc/network/</code> contains a variety of information about
  the current network, on some Linux distributions, especially in the
  file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. Various utilities, especially <code>ifup</code>
  and <code>ifdown</code> (or <code>iwup</code> and <code>iwdown</code> for wireless interfaces) are
  contained in <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/</code> on some distributions
  (but the same scripts may live elsewhere instead on your
  distribution).
</p>
<h3>'/var/log/syslog' And '/var/log/messages'</h3>
 <p>
  Messages logged by the kernel or the <code>syslogd</code> facility are stored in
  the log files <code>/var/log/syslog</code> and <code>/var/log/messages</code>.  The tutorial
  for LPI Exam 201, Topic 211 (System Maintenance) discusses system
  logging in greater detail.  The utility <code>dmesg</code> is generally used to
  examine logs.
</p>
<h3>'/etc/resolv.conf'</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorial Topic 207 (Domain Name System) discusses
  <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> in greater detail.  Generally, this file simply
  contains the information needed to find domain name servers.  It may
  be configured either manually or via dynamic means such as RIP, DHCP
  or NIS.
</p>
<h3>'/etc/hosts'</h3>
 <p>
  The file <code>/etc/hosts</code> is usually the first place a Linux system looks
  to attempt to resolve a symbolic hostname.  Adding entries can either
  bypass DNS lookup (or sometimes YP or NIS facilities), or can be used
  to name hosts that are not available on DNS, often because they are
  strictly names on the local network.
</p>
<p>
  For example,
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ cat /etc/hosts
# Set some local addresses
127.0.0.1         localhost
255.255.255.255   broadcasthost
192.168.2.1       artemis.gnosis.lan
192.168.2.2       bacchus.gnosis.lan
# Set undesirable site patterns to loopback
127.0.0.1       *.doubleclick.com
127.0.0.1       *.advertising.com
127.0.0.1       *.valueclick.com

</pre></div><h3>'/etc/hostname' And '/etc/HOSTNAME'</h3>
 <p>
  The file <code>/etc/HOSTNAME</code> (on some systems without the capitalization)
  is sometimes used for the symbolic name of the localhost, as known on
  the network.  However, use of this file varies between distributions,
  and generally <code>/etc/hosts</code> is used exclusively on modern
  distributions.
</p>
<h3>'/etc/hosts.allow' And '/etc/hosts.deny'</h3>
 <p>
  The tutorials on Topic 209 (File Sharing Servers) and Topic 212
  (System Security) discusses the files <code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> and
  <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> in greater detail. These configuration files are
  used for positive and negative access lists by a variety of network
  tools.  Read the manpages on these configuration files for more
  information on the specification of wildcards, ranges, and specific
  permissions that may be granted or denied.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond initial setup to enforce system security, you often want to
  examine the content of these is a connection that "just seems like" it
  should be working fails to.  Generally, examining access control
  issues will come after examining basic interface and routing
  information in a debugging effort.  That is, if you cannot reach a
  particular host at all (or it cannot reach you), it does not matter
  whether the host has permissions to use the services your provide.
  But selective failures in connections and service utilization can
  often be because of access control issues.
