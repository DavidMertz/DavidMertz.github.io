    In some ways the design of Python resembles the design of
    Java. Both utilize a virtual machine that interprets
    specialized pseudo-compiled byte-codes.  One area where JVM's
    are more advanced than Python is in optimizing the execution
    of byte-codes. To Python's rescue comes Psyco--the Python
    Specializing Compiler--which right now is an external module,
    but which could someday be included in Python itself.  With
    only a tiny amount of extra programming, Psyco can often
    be used to increase the speed of Python code by orders of
    magnitude. This article looks at what Psco is, and tests it
    in some applications.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  Python is usually fast enough for what you want it to do.
  Ninety percent of the concerns that novice programmers express
  about the execution speed of an interpreted/byte-compiled
  language like Python are simply naive.  On modern hardware,
  most unoptimized Python programs run as fast as they need to,
  and there is really no point in spending extra programming
  effort to make an application run faster.
</p>
<p>
  This installment, therefore, is only interested in that other
  10%.  Once in while, Python programs (or programs in other
  languages) run impracticably slowly.  What is needed for a
  given purpose varies greatly--shaving off milliseconds is
  rarely compelling (but more often than never), but speeding up
  tasks that run for minutes, hours, days, or weeks is often
  worthwhile.  Moreover, it should be noted that not everything
  that runs slowly is CPU bound; if a database query takes hours
  to complete, for example, it makes little difference whether
  the resulting dataset takes one or two minutes to process.
  This installment is also not about I/O issues.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of ways to speed up Python programs.  The
  first technique that should come to every programmers mind is
  an improvement to the algorithms and data structures used.
  Micro-optimizing the steps of an inefficient algorithm is a
  fool's errand.  For example, if the complexity order of the
  current technique is O(n**2), speeding up the steps by 10x is a
  lot less helpful where it matters than is finding an O(n)
  substitute.  This comparative moral applies even where
  approaches as extreme as a rewrite in assembly are
  considered--the right algorithm in Python will often go faster
  than the wrong algorithm in hand-tuned assembly.
</p>
<p>
  The second technique to consider is to profile your Python
  application, with an eye toward rewriting key portions as C
  extension modules.  Using an extension wrapper like SWIG, you
  can create a C extension that executes the most time consuming
  elements of your program as C code.  Extending Python in this
  manner is relatively straightforward, but does require a bit of
  a learning curve (and knowledge of C).  Very often you will
  find that the large majority of the time spent in executing
  your Python application is spent in just a handful of
  functions, so considerable gains are possible.
</p>
<p>
  A third technique builds on the second.  Greg Ewing has created
  a language called Pyrex, which melds Python and C.  In
  particular, to use Pyrex, you write functions in a Python-like
  language that adds type-declarations to selected variables.
  Pyrex (the tool) processes ".pyx" file into ".c" extensions.
  Once compiled with a C compiler, these Pyrex (the language)
  modules can be imported into and used in your regular Python
  applications.  Since Pyrex uses almost the same syntax as
  Python itself--including loop, branch and exception statements;
  assigment forms; block indentation; and so on--a Pyrex
  programmer need not learn C to write extensions.  Moreover,
  Pyrex allows more seamless mixing of C-level variables and
  Python-level variables (objects) within the same code than does
  an extension written directly in C.
</p>
<p>
  A final technique is the subject of this installment.  The
  extension module Psyco can plug in to the guts of the Python
  interpreter, and selectively substitute optimized machine code
  for portions of Python's interpreted byte-code.  Unlike the
  other techniques described, Psyco operates strictly at Python
  runtime.  That is, Python source code is compiled by the
  <code>python</code> command to byte-code in exactly the same manner as
  before (except for a couple <code>import</code> statements and function
  calls added to invoke Psyco).  But while the Python interpreter
  is running an application, Psyco sometimes checks to see if it
  can substitute some specialized machine code for regular Python
  byte-code actions.  This specialized compilation is both
  very similar to what Java just-in-time compilers do--broadly
  speaking, at least--and is architecture specific.  As of right
  now, Psyco is only available for i386 CPU architectures.  The
  nice thing about Psyco is that you can use the very same Python
  code you have been writing all along (and <em>very same</em> is quite
  literally true), but let it run much faster.
</p>
<h3>How Psyco Works</h3>
 <p>
  To understand Psyco completely, you probably need to have a
  good grasp of both the Python interpreter's <code>eval_frame()</code>
  function and i386 Assembly.  Unfortunately, I myself can claim
  neither expertise--but I think I can explain Psyco in outline
  wihtout going too far wrong.  For more definative word, consult
  Psyco creator Armin Rigo's essay entitled <cite>Psyco, the Python
  Specializing Compiler</cite> (see Resources).
</p>
<p>
  In regular Python, the <code>eval_frame()</code> function is the inner
  loop of the Python interpreter.  Basically, the <code>eval_frame()</code>
  function looks at the current byte-code in an execution
  context, and switches control out to a function appropriate for
  implementing that byte-code.  The specifics of what this
  support function will do depend, in general, upon that states
  of various Python objects held in memory.  To make it simple,
  adding the Python objects "2" and "3" produces a different
  result than adding the objects "5" and "6".  But both
  operations are dispatched in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
  Psyco replaces the <code>eval_frame()</code> function with a compound
  evaluation unit.  There are several ways that Psyco is able to
  improve upon what Python does.  In the first place, Psyco
  compiles operations to somewhat opitimized machine code; in
  itself this produces only slight improvements, since what the
  machine code needs to accomplish is the same as what Python's
  dispatched functions do.  Moreover, what is "specialized" in
  Psyco compilation is more than the choice of Python byte-codes,
  Psyco also specializes over variable values that are known in
  execution contexts.  For example, in code like the below, the
  variable <code>x</code> is knowable for the duration of the loop:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>x = 5
l = []
for i in range(1000):
    l.append(x*i)

</pre></div><p>
  An optimized version of this code need not multiply each <code>i</code> by
  "the content of the x variable/object"--it is less expensive to
  simply multiply each <code>i</code> by 5, saving a lookup/dereference.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from creating i386 specific codes for small operations,
  Psyco caches this compiled machine code for later reuse.  If
  Psyco is able to recognize that a particular operation is the
  same as something that was performed (and "specialized")
  earlier, it can rely on this cached code, rather than need to
  recompile the segment.  This saves a bit more time.
</p>
<p>
  The real savings in Psyco, however, relates to Psyco's
  categorization of operations into three different levels.
  For Psyco, there are "run-time", "compile-time" and
  "virtual-time" variable.  Psyco promotes and demotes variables
  between the levels as needed.  Run-time variables are simply
  the raw byte-codes and object structures that the regular
  Python interpreter handles.  Compile-time variables are
  represented in machine registers and directly accessed memory
  locations, once operations have been compiled by Psyco into
  machine code.
</p>
<p>
  The most interesting level is virtual-time variables.  A Python
  variable is, internally, a complete structure, with lots of
  members--even when the object only represents an integer, for
  example.  Psyco virtual time variables represent Python objects
  that could potentially be built if the need arose, but whose
  details are omitted until such time.  For example, consider an
  assignment like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>x = 15 * (14 + (13 - (12 / 11)))

</pre></div><p>
  Standard Python builds and destroys a number of objects to
  compute this value.  An entire integer object is built to hold
  the value of <code>(12/11)</code>; then a value is pulled out of the
  temporary object's structure, and used to compute a new
  temporary object <code>(13-PyInt)</code>.  Psyco skips the objects, and
  just computes the values--knowing that an object can be created
  "if needed" from the value.
</p>
<h3>Using Psyco</h3>
 <p>
  Explaining Psyco is relatively difficult.  <em>Using</em> Psyco is far
  easier.  Basically, all there is to it is telling the Psyco
  module which which functions/methods to "specialize." No code
  changes need be made to any of your Python functions and
  classes themselves.
</p>
<p>
  There are a couple approaches to specifying what Psyco should
  do.  The "shotgun" approach is to enable Psyco just-in-time
  operation everywhere.  To do that, put the following lines at
  the top of your module:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>import psyco ; psyco.jit()
from psyco.classes import *

</pre></div><p>
  The first line tells Psyco to do its magic on all global
  functions.  The second line--in Python 2.2 and above--tells
  Psyco to do the same with class methods.  To target Psyco's
  behavior a bit more precisely, you can use the commands:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>psyco.bind(somefunc)          # or method, class
newname = psyco.proxy(func)

</pre></div><p>
  The second form leaves <code>func</code> as an standard Python function,
  but optimizes calls involving <code>newname</code>.  In almost all cases
  other than testing and debugging, the <code>psyco.bind()</code> form is
  what you will use.
</p>
<h3>The Performance Of Psyco</h3>
 <p>
  As magic as Psyco is, using it still requires a little of
  thought and testing.  The main thing to understand is that
  Psyco is useful for handling blocks that loop many times, and
  knows how to optimize operations involving integers and
  floating point numbers.  By the way, Rigo's excellent, but year
  old, introduction to Psyco states that Psyco only optimizes
  integers--that is no longer true, floats benefit also.  For
  non-looping functions, and for operations on other types of
  objects, Psyco mostly just adds overhead for its analysis and
  internal-compilation.  Moreover, for applications with large
  numbers of functions and classes, enabling Psyco
  application-wide adds a large burden in machine-code
  compilation and memory-usage for this caching.  It is far
  better to selectively bind those functions that can benefit
  most from Psyco's optimizations.
</p>
<p>
  I started my testing in a completely naive fashion.  I simply
  considered what application I have run recently that I would
  not mind speeding up.  The first example that came to mind was
  a text-manipulation program I use to convert drafts of my
  forthcoming book (<cite>Text Processing in Python</cite>) to LaTeX format.
  This application uses some string methods, some regular
  expressions, and some program logic driven mostly by regular
  expression and string matches.  It is actually a terrible
  candidate for Psyco--but I use it, so I tried it.
</p>
<p>
  First pass, all I did was add <code>psyco.jit()</code> to the top of my
  script.  Painless enough.  Unfortunately, the results were
  (expectedly) disappointing.  Where the script initially took
  about 8.5 seconds to run, after Psyco "speedup" it ran in about
  12 seconds.  Not so good.  Thought I: the just-in-time
  compilation probably has some startup overhead that swamps the
  running time.  So next thing I tried was processing a much
  larger input file (consisting of multiple copies of the
  original one).  This gave the very limited success of reducing
  running time from about 120 seconds to 110 seconds.  The
  speedup was consistent across several runs, but fairly
  insignificant either way.
</p>
<p>
  Second pass with my--still poor--text processing candidate.
  Instead of adding a blanket <code>psyco.jit()</code> call, I added only
  the line <code>psyco.bind(main)</code>, since the <code>main()</code> function <em>does</em>
  loop a number of times (but only makes minimal use of integer
  arithmetic).  The results here were nominally better.  This
  approach shaved a few tenths of a second of the normal running
  time, and a few seconds off the large-input version.  But still
  nothing spectacular (but also no harm done).
</p>
<p>
  For a more relevant test of Psyco, I dug up some neural network
  code that I had written about in an earlier article (see
  Resources).  This "code_recognizer" application can be trained
  to recognize the likely distribution of different ASCII values
  in different programming languages.  Potentially something like
  this could be useful in guessing file types (say of lost
  network packets); but the code is actually completely generic
  as to what it is trained on--it could learn to recognize faces,
  or sounds, or tidal patterns just as easily.  In any case,
  "code_recognizer" is based on the Python library <em><code>bpnn</code></em> which
  is also included (in modified form) as a test case with the
  Psyco 0.4 distribution.  The important thing to know about
  "code_recognizer" for this article is that it does a lot of
  looping floating point math, and it takes a long time to run.
  We have got a good candidate for Psyco to work on here.
</p>
<p>
  After a little playing around, I established several details
  about how to use Psyco.  For this application, with just a
  small number of classes and functions, it does not make too
  much difference whether you use just-in-time or targetted
  binding.  But the best result, by a few percentage points,
  still comes about by selectively binding the best optimizable
  classes.  More significantly, however, it is important to
  understand the scope of Psyco binding.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>code_recognizer.py</code> script contains lines like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>from bpnn import NN
class NN2(NN):
    # customized output methods, math core inherited

</pre></div><p>
  That is, the interesting stuff from Psyco's point-of-view is in
  the class <code>bpnn.NN</code>.  Adding either <code>psyco.jit()</code> or
  <code>psyco.bind(NN2)</code> to the <code>code_recognizer.py</code> script has little
  effect.  To get Psyco to do the desired optimization, you need
  to either add <code>psyco.bind(NN)</code> to <code>code_recognizer.py</code> or add
  <code>psyco.jit()</code> to <code>bpnn.py</code>.  Contrary to what you might assume,
  just-in-time does not happen when an instance is created, or
  methods run, but rather in the scope where the class is
  defined.  In addition, binding descendent classes does not
  specialize their methods that are inherited from elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  Once the small details of proper Psyco binding are worked out,
  the resultant speedups are rather impressive.  Using the same
  test cases and training regime the referenced article presented
  (500 training patterns, 1000 training iterations), neural net
  training time was reduced from about 2000 seconds to about 600
  seconds--better than a 3x speedup.  Reducing the iterations as
  low as 10 showed proportional speedups (but worthless neural
  net recognition)--as did intermediate numbers of iterations.
</p>
<p>
  I find bringing running time down from more than 1/2 hour to
  about 10 minutes with two lines of new code to be quite
  interesting.  This speedup is still probably less than the
  speed of a similar application in C--and it is certainly less
  than the 100x speedup that a few isolated Psyco test cases
  exhibit.  But this application is fairly "real life" and the
  improvements are enough to be significant in many contexts.
</p>
<h3>Whither Psyco</h3>
 <p>
  Psyco currently does not perform any sort of internal
  statistics or profiling, and does only minimal optimization of
  generated machine code.  Potentially, a later version might
  know how to target those Python operations that could actually
  benefit most, and discard cached machine code for
  non-optimizable sections.  In addition, perhaps a future Psyco
  could decide to perform more extensive (but more costly)
  optimizations on heavily run operations. Such runtime analysis
  would be similar to what Sun's HotSpot technology does for
  Java; the fact that Java, unlike Python, has type-declarations
  is actually less significant than many people assume (but prior
  work in optimization of Self, Smalltalk, Lisp, and Scheme
  make this point also).
</p>
<p>
  Although I suspect it will never actually happen, it would be
  exciting to have Psyco-type technology integrated into some
  future version of Python itself.  A few lines for imports and
  bindings is not much to do, but letting Python just inherently
  run much faster would be even more seamless.  We will see.

  Greg Ewing has created the language Pyrex, which is used for
  writing Python extension modules.  The idea behind Pyrex is to
  define a language that looks very close to Python itself, and
  that allows a mixture of Python and C datatypes to be combined,
  but which is ultimately transformed and compiled into a Python
  C-extension.  Pyrex information (and the system itself) can be

  John Max Skaller's Vyper language was intended to be an
  enhanced Python, implemented in OCaml.  One upshot that was
  hoped for in the project was compilation to the same machine
  code OCaml generates, which is generally comparable with the
  speed of C.  Unfortunately, Vyper is a dead project, and a
  compiling version was never completed.  Back when the project
  was alive, I interviewed Skaller about the project:
