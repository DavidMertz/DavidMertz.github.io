<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "File Sharing Servers", the fifth of eight tutorials
  designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial you will
  learn how to use a Linux system as a networked file server, using
  any of several protocols supported by Linux.
</p>
<p>
  The current LPI guidelines for the specific Topic 209 exam cover NFS
  and Samba. A system administrator designing a server configuration,
  however, should also keep in mind whether FTP, SCP/SSH, HTTP, or other
  protocols might, in fact, fit their specific requirements.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About file servers
</h3>
 <p>
  One of the most significant uses for Linux, particularly in a server
  context, is providing shared files to client systems.  In fact, in a
  general way, serving files is probably most of what all networking is
  used for.  This tutorial--and in fact, this series of tutorials--will
  not address peer-to-peer file sharing servers such as BitTorrent.
  Rather, we will look only at older client-server arrangements: a
  central server that provides disk stores for multiple clients.  Even
  when clients upload files, those are always stored and served by the
  server, rather than in a decentralized fashion.
</p>
<p>
  Protocols widely used for file serving include HTTP (the WWW), TFTP
  (trivial file transfer protocol), FTP (file transfer protocol), SCP
  (secure copy; a specialized use of SSH), RCP (remote copy; generally
  deprecated), NFS (network file system), and Samba (server message
  block).  HTTP and SSH will be discussed in the tutorials for LPI exam
  202, as will security issues around FTP.  TFTP and RCP are special
  purpose or deprecated, and will not be addressed in these tutorials.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial looks at NFS and Samba in some detail, and briefly
  describes FTP. NFS and Samba are network file sharing protocols that
  allow mostly transparent access to remote filesystems.  FTP might
  require a custom FTP client program, although many desktop
  environments or tools (on Linux or otherwise) hide the details of this
  negotiation, and effectively present the same user interface as an NFS
  or Samba mounted drive.
</p>
<h3>Network File System</h3>
 <h3>Using NFS on a client
</h3>
 <p>
  If the server is properly configured, and the client has appropriate
  permissions, mounting a remote filesystem with NFS requires only the
  <code>mount</code> command:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>mount -t nfs my.nfs.server.com:/path/on/server /path/on/client

</pre></div><p>
  or a suitable entry in <code>/etc/fstab</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>my.nfs.server.com:/path/on/server /path/on/client nfs rw,soft 0 0

</pre></div><p>
  The <code>soft</code> option tells the kernel to send an IO error (EIO) to user
  processes in the event of network difficulties. The default <code>hard</code>
  option will cause processes to hang while the nfs server is
  unreachable.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the helper programs <code>rpc.lockd</code>, <code>rpc.statd</code>, and
  <code>rpc.quotad</code> may be run on client and/or server.
</p>
<h3>Configuring an NFS server (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  An NFS server requires 3 distinct programs, as well as 3 optional
  programs.
</p>
<p>
  When an NFS client mounts an NFS file system, it contacts the
  following server daemons, most of which must run stand alone (as
  opposed to being started from <code>inetd</code>): <code>portmap</code> (sometimes named
  <code>portmapper</code> or rpc.bind), <code>rpc.mountd</code> (sometimes <code>mounted</code>), and
  <code>rpc.nfsd</code> (sometimes <code>nfsd</code>).
</p>
<p>
  In addition, there are three optional helper programs <code>rpc.lockd</code>,
  <code>rpc.statd</code>, and <code>rpc.quotad</code> which respectively provide global
  locking, accelerate the <code>lstat</code> family of syscalls (used by <code>ls -l</code>,
  etc), and provide support for quotas.
</p>
<h3>Configuring an NFS server (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  All three NFS related servers use "TCPwrappers" (i.e. <code>tcpd</code>) for
  access control, and hence may require entries in <code>/etc/host.allow</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Neither <code>nfsd</code> nor <code>portmap</code> normally require any configuration beyond
  /etc/hosts.allow.
</p>
<p>
  The configuration file for <code>mountd</code> is (indirectly) <code>/etc/exports</code>. It
  says which filesystems can be mounted by which clients. Under the
  Linux implementation of NFS, <code>/etc/exports</code> is not directly parsed by
  <code>mountd</code>. Instead, the <code>exportfs -a</code> command parses <code>/etc/exports</code> and
  writes the result to <code>/var/lib/nfs/xtab</code> where <code>mountd</code> can read it.
  There are other flags to <code>exportfs</code> which allow these two files to be
  desynchronized. That is, you may temporarily add or remove exported
  directories without modifying the semi-permanent records in
  <code>/etc/exports</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Administrators of other Unix-like servers should note that the syntax
  of the Linux <code>/etc/exports</code> file differs significantly from that of
  SunOS or BSD.
</p>
<h3>Configuring /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny
</h3>
 <p>
  The configuration file <code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> describes hosts that are
  allowed to connect to a Linux system.  This configuration is not
  specific to NFS, but a system needs to be permitted to connect in the
  first place to use and NFS server.  Similarly, <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> is a
  list of hosts prohibited from connecting.
</p>
<p>
  Slightly unintuitively, first allowed hosts are searched, then denied
  hosts, but anything left unmatched is granted access.  This does not
  mean that the login mechanisms of individual servers are not still
  operative, but a cautious administrator might deny anything not
  explicitly permitted (a little paranoia is good) by using:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># /etc/hosts.deny
ALL:ALL EXCEPT localhost:DENY

</pre></div><p>
  With an <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> set to deny everything (except connections
  from LOCALHOST), only those connections explicitly permitted will be
  allowed.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>#/etc/hosts.allow
# Allow localhost and intra-net domain to use all servers
ALL : 127.0.0.1, 192.168.
# Let everyone ssh here except 216.73.92.* and .microsoft.com
sshd: ALL EXCEPT 216.73.92. .microsoft.com : ALLOW
# Let users in the *.example.net domain ftp in
ftpd: .example.net

</pre></div><h3>Configuring /etc/exports
</h3>
 <p>
  Here's a sample /etc/export file:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># sample /etc/exports file
/               master(rw) trusty(rw,no_root_squash)
/projects       proj*.local.domain(rw)
/usr            *.local.domain(ro) @trusted(rw)
/home/joe       pc001(rw,all_squash,anonuid=150,anongid=100)
/pub            (ro,insecure,all_squash)

</pre></div><p>
  Normally, <code>root</code> (uid 0) on the client is treated as <code>nobody</code> (uid
  65534) on the server; this is called <code>root squashing</code> as it protects
  files owned by root (and not group/other writable) from being altered
  by NFS clients. The <code>no_root_squash</code> tag disables this behavior, and
  allows the root user on <code>trusty</code> full access to the <code>/</code> partition.
  This can be useful for installing and configuring software.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>/usr</code> partition will be read only for all hosts except those in
  the "trusted" netgroup.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>/home/joe</code> is mounted by <code>pc001</code>, all remote users (regardless
  of uid/gid) will be treated as if they have uid=150, gid=100. This is
  useful if the remote NFS client is a single user workstation or does
  not support different users (e.g. DOS).
</p>
<p>
  Normally, Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) reserves the
  use of TCP and UDP ports 1-1023 (so called <code>secure ports</code>) for use by
  processes running as root. To ensure that the root user has initiated
  a remote NFS mount, the NFS server normally requires remote clients to
  use "secure ports" when mounting NFS filesystems. This convention,
  however, is not honored by some operating systems (notably Windows).
  In such cases, the <code>insecure</code> option allows the NFS client to use any
  TCP/UDP port. This is usually required when serving Windows clients.
</p>
<h3>NFS utilities
</h3>
 <p>
  <code>nfsstat</code> displays a time series of NFS related statistics (client
  and/or server) regarding the local machine similar to <code>iostat</code> and
  <code>vmstat</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>showmount</code> command queries <code>mountd</code> and shows which clients are
  currently mounting filesystems. As NFS is a stateless protocol, and
  the <code>mountd</code> daemon is queried infrequently, the output of <code>showmount</code>
  can become inaccurate.  Unfortunately, there is not really any way to
  force <code>showmount</code> to become accurate.  However, where it is
  inaccurate, <code>showmount</code> almost always errs in showing stale mounts
  rather than omitting active mounts (i.e. relatively harmlessly).
</p>
<p>
  In this context, "stateless" means that the <code>nfsd</code> daemons that serve
  up the actual file data have no memory of which files are open, nor
  even which clients have which partitions mounted. Each request
  (readblock, writeblock, etc) contains all the information needed to
  complete it (partition id provided by <code>mountd</code>, inode number, block
  number(s), read/write/etc, data). The HTTP protocol is similar in this
  respect. An upside of statelessness if the server reboots, the clients
  will notice only a brief period of interrupted access.
</p>
<h3>Server Message Block</h3>
 <h3>Samba server configuration
</h3>
 <p>
  The Samba server <code>smbd</code> provides file and print services (largely for
  Windows clients). While it can be started from <code>inetd</code>, it is
  typically run as a stand alone daemon <code>smbd -D</code>. <code>nmbd</code> is the netbios
  nameserver (or WINS server). It too can be run from <code>inetd</code>, but is
  more typically run as a stand alone daemon <code>nmbd -D</code>. Samba can
  function as a server in a Windows WORKGROUP, as well as Primary Domain
  Controller.
</p>
<p>
  The configuration file for both <code>smbd</code> and <code>nmbd</code> is
  <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>. Copious configuration parameters are described
  in the <code>smb.conf</code> man page. The <code>lmhosts</code> file is used to map NetBios
  names to IP addresses. It's format is similar to (but not identical
  to) the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  There are several excellent HOWTOs on the subject of Samba
  configuration as well as several books. This section touches on the
  basic ideas with pointers to more complete documentation.
</p>
<h3>Setting up a home-directory file share
</h3>
 <p>
  The following <code>smb.conf</code> snippet allows users to access their
  (local) home directories from remote Samba clients:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no

</pre></div><p>
  This is usually included in the default <code>smb.conf</code> file.
</p>
<h3>Setting up a print share with CUPS
</h3>
 <p>
  Of the numerous Unix printing systems, CUPS is the least antiquated
  and probably the currently most popular. Depending on your
  distribution, CUPS may be enabled in the default <code>smb.conf</code>. Here is a
  simple example of a CUPS print share:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>[global]
  load printers = yes
  printing = cups
  printcap name = cups

[printers]
  comment = All Printers
  path = /var/spool/samba
  browseable = no
  public = yes
  guest ok = yes
  writable = no
  printable = yes
  printer admin = root

[print$]
  comment = Printer Drivers
  path = /etc/samba/drivers
  browseable = yes
  guest ok = no
  read only = yes
  write list = root

</pre></div><p>
  CUPS can provide <code>ppd</code> (Postscript printer description) files and
  Windows drivers for clients, which, when setup properly, allow remote
  users to take advantage of the full range of a printers features
  (color versus black-and-white, resolution, paper tray select, double
  vs single sided printing, etc). Traditional Unix printing systems are
  quite cumbersome by comparison. Consult the <code>cupsaddsmb</code> man page for
  more information.
</p>
<h3>Authentication
</h3>
 <p>
  Samba (unlike NFS) requires individual users to authenticate with the
  server. As with any network authentication service, care should be
  taken to insure that passwords are never passed over the network
  unencrypted. See the section on "encrypt passwords" in the <code>smb.conf</code>
  man page for details.
</p>
<p>
  There are a variety of mechanisms Samba can use to authenticate remote
  users (clients). By their nature most of these are incompatible with
  the standard Unix password hash. The notable exception is when
  passwords are passed over the wire in the clear unencrypted, which is
  almost always a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming you encrypt passwords on the wire, <code>smbpasswd</code> will usually
  be used to setup users with an initial Samba password. The "Unix
  password sync" option allows <code>smbpasswd</code> to change Unix passwords
  whenever users change their Samba password.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, the <code>pam_smb</code> module when configured can authenticate
  Linux users using the Samba database directly. As if that's not enough
  choices, LDAP can be used to authenticate Samba and/or Linux users.
</p>
<h3>Debugging Samba
</h3>
 <p>
  When configuring a Samba server, the <code>testparm</code> (also called
  <code>smbtestparm</code>) command can be quite useful. It will parse the
  <code>smb.conf</code> file and report any problems.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>nmblookup</code> command does for Samba what <code>nslookup</code> does for DNS;
  it queries the NetBios directory. See the <code>nmblookup</code> man page for
  more details.
</p>
<h3>Samba client configuration
</h3>
 <p>
  The <code>smbclient</code> command provides FTP-like access to a Samba file
  share. Transparent access to SMB file shares is trickier; see the
  <code>smbmount</code> man page or the <code>sharity</code> package for more info.
</p>
<h3>File Transfer Protocol</h3>
 <h3>About FTP
</h3>
 <p>
  FTP is an old and widely used network protocol. FTP is normally run
  over two separate ports, 20 and 21. Port 21 is used as a control
  stream (transmitting login information and commands) while port 20 is
  used as the data stream over which actual file content is transmitted.
</p>
<p>
  Generally, FTP is not considered a very secure protocol in the sense
  that in its default mode of operation, control information--i.e. login
  passwords--are transmitted in the clear.  For that matter, data
  streams are also unencrypted, but FTP shares that feature with NFS and
  Samba (for secure data channels, SSH/SCP is a better choice).  It <strong>is</strong>
  possible to layer FTP's control port over SSH, hence protecting
  control information.
</p>
<p>
  Traditional FTP clients provide their own shell environment over which
  to transmit control commands and configure connections.  Sometimes GUI
  frontends are used to provide friendlier interfaces to FTP transfers.
  However, nowadays, many non-dedicated tools incorporate
  FTP--everything from file managers to text editors are often happy to
  work with files served by an FTP server.
</p>
<h3>Anonymous FTP
</h3>
 <p>
  For what FTP is most often used for, its security usually does not
  matter. Probably most often, FTP servers are used for "anonymous
  FTP"--that is, data that is available to the world at large, and hence
  does not require security. By convention, a username of <code>anonymous</code> is
  configured to allow access, and an identifying password (often an
  email address) is requested but not verified. Sometimes a
  username/password is required, but such a combination is provided
  without any deep user authentication (e.g. people who want to
  volunteer for a project).
</p>
<p>
  Most web browsers and many file managers and tools support FTP servers
  transparently.  Often these tools will use an FTP URL to request a
  file (or also to upload a file <strong>to</strong> a server).  For example, the
  command line tool <code>wget</code> will retreive files from FTP servers using
  e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ wget ftp://example.net/pub/somefile
$ wget ftp://user:passwd@example.net/pub/somefile

</pre></div><p>
  File managers will often "mount" an FTP server in a manner that is
  essentially identical to a local filesystem, or NFS or Samba drive
  (this does not, however, use the <code>mount</code> and <code>/etc/fstab</code> system; and
  such pseudo-partititions are usually named by their URL).
</p>
<h3>Choices of FTP servers
</h3>
 <p>
  Given the age and ubiquity of FTP a bewildering number of
  implementations are available, and installed with various Linux
  distributions. Configuring the FTP server you decide to use will
  require a visit to the documentation accompanying the particular
  server.
</p>
<p>
  Some popular Linux FTP servers include <code>wu-ftpd</code>, <code>vsftpd</code>, <code>ProFTPd</code>,
  <code>BSD ftpd</code>, and TUX FTP.  There are many less used ones as well.  In
  most every case, the configuration of a server will live in a file
  like <code>/etc/FOOftpd.conf</code> (for an appropriate value of "FOO").  I am
  fond of <code>vsftpd</code>, which is both fast and avoids known security
  glitches (the "vs" stands for "very secure").
</p>
<h3>A sample FTPd configuration file
</h3>
 <p>
  Given the wealth of servers, configuration syntaxes will differ.  But
  a few concepts taken from <code>/etc/vsftpd.conf</code> illustrate the types of
  options other servers provide.  For <code>vsftpd</code> each option takes the
  form "option=value", with the usual hash marks for comment lines.
  Most other FTPd configuration files are similar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> anonymous_enable: Controls whether anonymous logins are permitted.
  </strong> anon_world_readable_only: When enabled, anonymous users will only be
</p>
<blockquote>
    allowed to download world-readable files.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * chroot_local_user: If enabled, local users will be placed in a
</p>
<blockquote>
    chroot() jail in their home directory after login.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * pasv_enable: Should the server use the "passive FTP" style in which
</p>
<blockquote>
    clients initiate ports (helps with firewalls at clients).
</blockquote>
<p>
  <strong> ssl_enable: If enabled, vsftpd will support SSL secure connections.
  </strong> tcp_wrappers: If  enabled incoming connections will be fed through
</p>
<blockquote>
    access control (i.e. <code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> and <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code>.
</blockquote>
<h3>Launching an FTP server
</h3>
 <p>
  In the simplest case, you may start an FTP server the same way you
  might launch any daemon, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% sudo vsftpd

</pre></div><p>
  At this point the server will listen for incoming connections,
  according the rules configured in its configuration file.  You may
  also launch an FTP server from an "network super-server" such as
  <code>inetd</code> or <code>xinetd</code>.  The LPI 202 tutorials will discuss these
  super-servers.
</p>
<p>
  Launching a daemon individually, even if in appropiate startup
  scripts--either for a particular runlevel or in <code>/etc/rcS.d/</code>--gives
  you finer control over the behavior of an FTP server.
