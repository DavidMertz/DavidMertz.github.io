CHARMING PYTHON #5
Text Processing in Python: Tips for Beginners

    Python shares a strength in text processing with several
    popular scripting languages.  Python excels as a tool for
    searching, modifying, and otherwise manipulating textual
    data.  This article reviews for a programmer fist learning
    Python the various text processing facilities built into
    Python.  Some general concepts of regular expressions are
    explained, as well as some advice given on when to use, and
    not to use, regular expressions in text processing tasks.


WHAT IS PYTHON?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.


LANGUAGE FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As in most programming languages, strings are a basic type in
  Python.  In common with most high-level languages (and
  especially scripting languages), Python strings are of
  indefinite length.  All issues of declarations and memory
  allocation to hold strings (or other values) goes on "behind
  the scenes" where a Python programmer does not need to give
  much thought to it. Python also has several convenient
  behaviors surrounding string variables that do not exist in
  other high-level languages.

  In Python, strings are "immutable sequences." One can refer to
  elements or subsequences of strings in the same manner as with
  any sequence.  However, strings (like tuples) cannot be
  modified "in place." A great flexibility with Python sequences
  comes with the "slice" operation.  In a natural-looking way
  (similar to a spreadsheet format), one can refer to a slice
  (i.e. subsequence) of a string.  The below interacive session
  illustrates the use of strings and slicing:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> s[0]          # index is zero-based
      'm'
      >>> s[3] = 'x'    # changing element in-place fails
      Traceback (innermost last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
      TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
      >>> s[11:18]      # 'slice' a subsequence
      'little '
      >>> s[:4]         # empty slice-begin assumes zero
      'mary'
      >>> s[4]          # index 4 is not included in slice [:4]
      ' '
      >>> s[5:-5]       # can use "from end" index with negs
      'had a little'
      >>> s[:5]+s[5:]   # slice-begin & slice-end are complementary
      'mary had a little lamb'

  Another powerful operation on strings is the simple 'in'
  keyword.  Two intuitive and useful constructs on strings come
  with the keyword:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> for c in s[11:18]: print c,  # print each char in slice
      ...
      l i t t l e
      >>> if 'x' in s: print 'got x'   # test for char occurence
      ...
      >>> if 'y' in s: print 'got y'   # test for char occurence
      ...
      got y

  There are several variations on composing string literals in
  Python. Single and double quotes may both be used, just so long
  as opening and closing tokens match.  Python offers two
  variations on quoting that are frequently useful.
  Triple-quoting is often the easiest means of composing strings
  that contain line breaks (or contain quotes as literals), for
  example:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> s2 = """Mary had a little lamb
      ... its fleece was white as snow
      ... and everywhere that Mary went
      ... the lamb was sure to go"""
      >>> print s2
      Mary had a little lamb
      its fleece was white as snow
      and everywhere that Mary went
      the lamb was sure to go

  Either single quoted or triple-quoted strings may be preceded
  by the letter "r" to indicate that regular expression special
  characters should not be interpreted by Python.  I.e.:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> s3 = "this \n and \n that"
      >>> print s3
      this
       and
       that
      >>> s4 = r"this \n and \n that"
      >>> print s4
      this \n and \n that

  In r-strings, the backslash that might otherwise compose an
  escaped character in a Python string is treated as a regular
  backslash.  See the below discussion of regular expressions to
  see why this is useful.


FILES AND STRING VARIABLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Most of the time when we talk about "text processing," what we
  want to process is the content of a file.  It is quite easy in
  Python to pull the contents out of a text file and into string
  variables (which is where they need to be for most
  manipulations, at some point).  File objects have three methods
  related to reading: '.read()', '.readline()', '.readlines()'.
  Each of these may take an argument to limit the amount of data
  read at one time, but the most common use is without an
  argument.  '.read()' reads in a file's entire contents at once,
  generally in the context of placing those contents into a
  string variable.  For sequential line-oriented processing, or
  if a file is likely to be larger than available memory, don't
  use this method.  But use '.read()' to get the most direct
  string representation of a file's contents.  '.readline()' and
  '.readlines()' are very similar.  They are both used in
  constructs like:

      #------------- Python .readlines() example -------------#
      fh = open('c:\\autoexec.bat')
      for line in fh.readlines():
          print line

  The difference between '.readline()' and '.readlines()' is that
  the latter, like '.read()', reads in an entire file at once.
  '.readlines()' automatically parses the read contents into a
  list of lines, thereby enabling the 'for ... in ...' construct
  common in Python.  Using '.readline()' reads in just a single
  line from a file at a time, and is generally much slower than
  '.readlines()'.  Really the only reason to use the
  '.readline()' version is if you expect to read very large
  files that might exceed available memory.

  Sometimes one wants to "reverse" the usual process of reading (or
  writing) strings from files, and instead treat strings
  themselves in a file-like manner.  This would usually occur in
  a context where one has a high-level function (including a
  number of standard modules) that wants to do something with a
  file object.  Fortunately, creating a "virtual file" in memory
  may be easily done using the [cStringIO] module (the [StringIO]
  module can be used instead in cases where subclassing the
  module is required; but a beginner is unlikely to need to do
  this).

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import cStringIO
      >>> fh = cStringIO.StringIO()
      >>> fh.write("mary had a little lamb")
      >>> fh.getvalue()
      'mary had a little lamb'
      >>> fh.seek(5)
      >>> fh.write('ATE')
      >>> fh.getvalue()
      'mary ATE a little lamb'

  Keep in mind, however, that a [cStringIO] "virtual file",
  unlike a real file, is not persistent.  It will be gone when
  the program completes execution if other steps are not taken to
  save it (such as saving it to a real file, or using the
  [shelve] module, or using a database system).


STANDARD MODULE [string]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The [string] module is probably the most generally useful
  module in Python 1.5.* standard distributions.  In fact, it
  appears that many of the facilities of the [string] module will
  exist as built-in methods of strings in 1.6 and above (but
  those have not been released at the time of this writing).
  Most certainly, any program performing text processing
  tasks should probably begin with the line:

      import string

  A general rule-of-thumb is that if you *can* do a task using the
  [string] module, that is the *right* way to do it.  In contrast
  to [re], [string] functions are generally much faster, and in
  most cases they are easier to understand and maintain.
  Third-party Python modules (some fast ones written in C) are
  available for specialized tasks.  But portability and
  familiarity still suggest sticking with [string] wherever
  possible (which is not always, but is probably more often than
  programmers coming from some other languages think is
  possible).

  The [string] module contains several types of things.  One type
  of thing in [string] is strings of common constants.  For
  example,

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import string
      >>> string.whitespace
      '\011\012\013\014\015 '
      >>> string.uppercase
      'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

  Although one could write these constants by hand, the [string]
  versions more-or-less assure that the constants used will be
  correct for the national language and platform the Python
  script gets run on.

  The next type of useful thing in [string] is functions to
  transform strings in common ways (and uncommon ways can
  generally be composed of several common transformations).  For
  example:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import string
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> string.capwords(s)
      'Mary Had A Little Lamb'
      >>> string.replace(s, 'little', 'ferocious')
      'mary had a ferocious lamb'

  There are many other tranformations that are not specifically
  illustrated, and the Python manuals contain details on them.

  Yet another useful type of thing in [string] is functions to
  report features of strings without themselves returning
  strings.  These functions return numbers indicating various
  features, e.g.:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import string
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> string.find(s, 'had')
      5
      >>> string.count(s, 'a')
      4

  The final type of thing in [string] is a very Pythonic oddball.
  The pair '.split()' and '.join()' provide a quick way to
  convert between strings and tuples.  This is useful to do
  remarkably often.  Usage is straightforward:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import string
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> L = string.split(s)
      >>> L
      ['mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
      >>> string.join(L, "-")
      'mary-had-a-little-lamb'

  Of course, in real-life usage, we would be likely to do
  something else with a list besides '.join()' it right back
  together (probably something involving our familiar 'for ... in
  ...' construct).


STANDARD MODULE [re]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The [re] module obsoletes the [regex] and [regsub] modules that
  you may see used in some older Python code.  While there are a
  few, limited advantages to [regex] still, they are minor and
  not worth using in new code.  The obsolete modules are likely
  to be dropped from future Python releases, and 1.6 is also
  likely to have an interface-compatible improved [re] module.
  So stick with [re] for regular expressions.

  Regular expressions are a complicated topic.  One could write a
  book on such a topic; in fact, a number of people have!
  However, this article will try to capture the "gestalt" of
  regular expressions, and let the reader work futher from there.
  A regular expression is a way of describing a pattern that
  might occur in a text.  Do these characters occur? In this
  order? Are subpatterns repeated the right number of times? Do
  other subpatterns exclude a match? Conceptually, regular
  expressions are actually very close to the way one would
  intuitively describe a pattern in a natural language.  The
  trick is encoding this description in the compact syntax of
  regular expressions.

  When approaching a regular expression, treat it as its own
  little (or big) programming problem.  Even though only one or
  two lines of code may be involved, those lines will effectively
  incorporate a small program.  The first thing to start with is
  the smallest bits.  Any regular expression, at its lowest
  level, will involve matching particular "character classes."
  The simplest character class is a single character, which is
  just included in the pattern as a literal.  Frequently, we want
  to allow matching of a class of characters.  One means of
  indicating a class is by surrounding it in square braces;
  within the braces both an enumeration of characters and ranges
  indicated with a dash may be used.  There are also a number of
  named character classes that may be abbreviated, and that will
  be accurate for platform and national language.  Some examples:

      #--------------- Python interactive session ------------#
      >>> import re
      >>> s = "mary had a little lamb"
      >>> if re.search("m", s): print "Match!"      # char literal
      ...
      Match!
      >>> if re.search("[@A-Z]", s): print "Match!" # char class
      ...     # match either at-sign or capital letter
      ...
      >>> if re.search("\d", s): print "Match!"     # digits class
      ...

  Character classes are "atomic" in regular expressions.  Usually
  what we want to do in useful expressions is compose "molecules"
  out of different character classes.  We compose larger
  expressions by a combination of *grouping* and by indicating
  *repetition*.  Grouping is performed with parentheses: any
  subexpression contained in parentheses is treated as if it were
  atomic for purposes of further grouping or repetition.
  Repetition is indicated by one of several operators.  "*" means
  "zero or more"; "+" means "one or more"; "?" means "zero or
  one".  For example, look at the expression:

      ABC([d-w]*\d\d?)+XYZ

  For a string to match this expression, it must contain
  something that starts with "ABC" and ends with "XYZ"--but what
  else must it have? The subexpression in the middle is
  '([d-w]*\d\d?)', and that is followed by the "one or more"
  operator.  So at least one thing matching the subexpression
  must occur... or it could be a thousand things matching the
  subexpression.  So the string, "ABCXYZ" will not match, because
  it does not have the requisite stuff in the middle.

  Just what is the requisite middle subexpression? It must
  contain *zero or more* letters in the range 'd-w'.  It is
  important to notice that zero letters is a valid match, which
  may be counterintuitive if you use the English word "some" to
  describe it.  Next we must have *exactly one* digit; then *zero
  or one* additional digits.  The first digit character class has
  no repitition operator, so it simply occurs once.  The second
  digit character class has the "?" operator.  Overall, it
  amounts to either one or two digits.  Some strings matched by
  the regular expression are:

      ABC1234567890XYZ
      ABCd12e1f37g3XYZ
      ABC1XYZ

  A few expressions *not* matched by the regular expression are
  below (try to think through why these do not match):

      ABC123456789dXYZ
      ABCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwXYZ
      ABcd12e1f37g3XYZ
      ABC12345%67890XYZ
      ABCD12E1F37G3XYZ

  It takes a bit of practice to get used to creating and
  understanding regular expressions.  But once they are mastered,
  a great deal of expressive power is obtained.  That said, it is
  often easy to jump into using a regular expression to solve a
  problem that could actually be solved using simpler (and
  faster) tools, such as [string].
