<blockquote>
    Looks at a half-dozen leading XML editors, and discusses the
    strengths, weaknesses and capabilities of each in a
    comparative way.
</blockquote>
<h3>Column Background</h3>
 <p>
  In the previous few columns, I have addressed details of the
  DocBook DTD and how to transform its XML documents to other
  formats.  One matter not yet addressed is the very practical
  question of just how one goes about creating, modifying and
  maintaining prose-oriented XML documents.  In this colum we
  look at a number of tools for working with prose-oriented XML
  documents, not limited to DocBook.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps it is obvious enough that the very first requirement of
  any approach to working with XML documents is assurance that we
  are producing <strong>valid</strong> documents in the process.  When we use a
  DTD (or an XML Schema), we do so because we want documents to
  conform with its rules.  Whatever tools are used must assure
  this validity as part of the creation and maintenance process.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the tools and techniques discussed are also serviceable
  means of working with more data-oriented XML documents, but the
  emphasis in this column is working with marked-up prose.  A
  few main difference stand out between prose-oriented XML and
  data-oriented XML; some XML dialects, moreover, fall somewhere
  between these categories, or outside of them altogether (MathML
  or vector graphic formats are neither prose nor data in the
  usual ways).  Prose-oriented XML formats are generally designed
  to capture the features one expects on a printed page (and
  therefore in a wordprocessor).  While most such formats aim to
  capture semantic rather than typographic features (e.g. the
  <em>concept</em> "foreign word" rather than the <em>font style</em>
  "italic"), their connection to traditional written and read
  materials is close.  On the other hand, data-oriented XML
  formats mirror more closely the contents of (relational)
  database formats; the contents can often be thought of as
  records/attributes (rows/columns), and one expects patterns of
  recurrent data fields.
</p>
<p>
  In prose-oriented XML dialects, one tends to encounter a great
  deal of <em>mixed</em> content, in data-oriented XML dialects little
  or none.  That is, most "data" is text that has character-level
  markup scattered through it.  In terms of a DTD, one sees
  elements that look something like (example taken from an IBM
  developerWorks DTD that it uses for tutorials):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&lt;!--Contains a paragraph of text.--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT p  (#PCDATA | code | img | br | i | b | a)* &gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, block-level markup is also used to provide
  overall organization, but character-level is important in a way
  that it rarely is in data-oriented XML formats.  The dichotomy
  between these markup levels poses the biggest challenge, in my
  experience, for XML editing tools to handle gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  Let us see how a few tools and approaches hold up to these
  needs.
</p>
<h3>Use A Text Editor And A Validator</h3>
 <p>
  The first approach to consider is what we might think of as the
  "zero case" (or "null hypothesis" to borrow from science, or
  "first principles" from philosophy) of XML document
  modification.  XML documents, after all, really are just text
  files in the end.  So why not use the tools for working with
  text files that have been highly refined, and with which a
  programmer already has a lot of knowledge and deeply felt
  opinions.  If you are like me, no matter how much you like some
  of the other tools discussed, there will always be those
  occassional times that you just want to see what is <em>really</em>
  going on by using a text editor.
</p>
<p>
  A good text editor for working with XML will have syntax
  highlighting that is generic for all XML dialects, and also
  probably the option of configuring something more specific for
  a given dialect.  It will have flexible (maybe
  regular-expression based) search and replace capabilities.  If
  the text editor can support <em>folding</em> (sometimes called "code
  hiding"), that often proves of great benefit, especially in
  handling large documents.  Obviously, being able to perform
  operations on blocks is useful, whether it is indent/dedent,
  cut/copy/paste, or templating.  And probably your favorite
  text editor (if you are a programmer) is easy to configure to
  call external programs that take the current working file as
  input.
</p>
<p>
  With a powerful text editor in hand, a few guidelines make
  working with prose-oriented XML easier.  Most of this is common
  sense, and most of it is the <em>same</em> common sense that applies
  to making your code in other programming languages look nice.
  Use indentation and whitespacing well; parts of an XML document
  should stand out as being what they are at a quick glance.
  Although XML itself is whitespace retensive, most application
  normalize whitespace before further processing.  So indenting
  and adding vertical space are not functionally important, but
  just make your XML documents easier to look at (if the few
  extra bytes are that important, you probably made a bad choice
  by choosing XML in the first place; it is quite <em>verborse</em>
  compared to other formats).  In general character-level
  elements are best kept inline, and block-level elements are
  best starting new (hierarchically indented) lines.  Obviously,
  use judgement rather than hard-and-fast rules for what looks
  clearest; but value clarity in appearance.
</p>
<p>
  Text editors will require an external tool to peform actual
  validation.  A lot of good ones are out there for various
  platforms.  I personally usually use the Python module
  <em><code>xmlproc</code></em>.  Whatever you use, your validator should give you
  sufficiently specific advice to make problems easy to locate
  and fix (usually including exact position of the errors and
  warnings).  For example, the below is part of a validation I
  ran:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>c:\xml-files\&gt;python xvcmd.py test.xml
xmlproc version 0.62

Parsing 'test.xml'
E:test.xml:6:110: Attribute 'zip_file_comment' not declared
E:test.xml:45:152: '&lt;' not allowed in attribute values
E:test.xml:55:34: '=' expected
E:test.xml:55:49: One of '&gt;' or '/&gt;' expected
E:test.xml:60:14: End tag for 'body' seen, but 'p' expected
E:test.xml:783:12: Premature document end, element 'p' not closed
[...]
Parse complete, 22 error(s) and 0 warning(s)

</pre></div><p>
  Editing and validating works much like an edit/compile or
  edit/unit-test cycle in a programming language.  If you
  validate frequently, cleaning up a few errors is not difficult
  or time-consuming.
</p>
<h3>Basic Enhanced Editors</h3>
 <p>
  Basic XML editing tools add basically three things to a generic
  text editor to make the more tailored for XML editing:  (1)
  integrated validation of documents; (2) hierarchical (tree)
  views of XML documents; (3) intergrated "preview" of
  transformed XML documents (to HTML, using XSLT or CSS2,
  generally).  Particular tools might offer a subset of these
  enhancements.  I have looked at three specific tools in this
  class (but others probably exist).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Microsoft <cite>XML Notepad</cite>:</strong> <cite>XML Notepad</cite> is more-or-less what you
  would expect from its name.  It is a free-of-cost tool--for
  Win32 only--that provides a parsed and structured view of XML
  documents.  In addition, <cite>XML Notepad</cite> will perform validation
  (only when the document is opened) against a declared DTD.  The
  basic interface to XML Notepad consists of a collapsible tree
  view of an XML document in one pane, with the other pane
  containing lines indicating the content of elements and
  attributes.  Editing elements or attributes is strictly one
  line per text block, which means you have to scroll left/right
  within an entry area for a paragraph.  Overall, <cite>XML Notepad</cite> is
  probably more suitable for editing data-oriented XML documents
  than prose-oriented ones.  But as a quick way to look through
  or make minimal changes in a prose-oriented document, the tool
  is not bad.  <cite>XML Notepad</cite> does not perform any sort of
  transformations, preview, or visual formatting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wattle Software <cite>XMLWriter</cite>:</strong> <cite>XMLWriter</cite> is a step up--or maybe
  sideways--from <cite>XML Notepad</cite>.  It is also a Win32 only product,
  but is shareware; you have to pay AU$75 to use it after a trial
  period (about US$40).  There is much more to the <cite>XMLWriter</cite>
  interface than in <cite>XML Notepad</cite>, although one thing that is a
  navigable tree/hierarchy view (you can do a preview-only tree
  view, but can neither edit in that view nor use it to jump to a
  navigable pane; it is also based on the somewhat flakey MSXML
  DLL for this function, so it doesn't always work).  However, in
  most respects, <cite>XMLWriter</cite> is a fairly rich working environment
  for modifying XML documents.
</p>
<p>
  The basic idea in <cite>XMLWriter</cite> is close to a text editor, with
  some XML specific extras thrown in.  The view of a document is
  a textual view, with syntax-highlighting, optional line
  numbering, and the general features one would expect in a
  decent text editor (but fewer bells-and-whistles than a generic
  programmers' editor).  However, beyond the text editor
  features, <cite>XMLWriter</cite> has options for validation and
  well-formedness checking, for XSLT conversion, for browser
  preview, and a concept of "projects" (collections of related
  files: XML, XSL, CSS, Schema, etc).  <cite>XMLWriter</cite> gives you a nice
  environment for working with XML that is still solidly in the
  "enhanced editor" category.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>TIBCO Extensibility <cite>XML Instance</cite>:</strong> <cite>XML Instance</cite> is a
  Java-based XML editor, and therefore is available on the range
  of platforms Java runs on.  Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) differ
  widely in quality and speed, and your satisfaction with <cite>XML
  Instance</cite> will depend partially on the JVM you use (IBM's have
  been the best in my experience, across several platforms).  Of
  those tools I call "enhanced editors," <cite>XML Instance</cite> is the most
  sophisticated; it's price of $100 matches that increase in
  features.
</p>
<p>
  In some ways, <cite>XML Instance</cite> resembles a much better done XML
  Notepad.  The same general collapsible-tree to the left,
  attribute/element content in line to the right, interface is
  used.  But that is just the starting point.  Each element can
  be viewed as either a subhierarchy or as raw markup.  By
  looking at raw markup for block-level elments that include
  character-level elements, you achieve the right distinction
  visually between the types of elements.  In addition, viewing
  an element is initially presented as a single line, but you can
  expand the view to include multiple lines (as many as needed
  with a scroll bar) on a per-element basis.  This lets you both
  navigate and edit in a flexible way.
</p>
<p>
  As well, <cite>XML Instance</cite> does a good job (but not perfect) with
  validation checking and XSL transformations (including editing
  XSLT documents).  <cite>XML Instance</cite> provides some rudimentary
  assistance in inserting subtags and attributes, but does not
  assist nearly as much--nor assure validity as well--as some of
  the other tools discussed in this column.
</p>
<p>
  These products can make a number of things easier, but these
  tools (and even the more sophisticated tools below) demand that
  you give up many of the powerful, but generic, capabilities, of
  a general text editor.  Mostly, these tools are good choices
  for users who do not yet have a programmers' text editor they
  use daily.
</p>
<h3>Xml Development Environments</h3>
 <p>
  Beyond basic editors, there are several tools available that
  one might describe as "integrated development environments
  (IDE)" for XML.  <cite>XML Instance</cite> comes close to this category,
  but lacks several things that other tools have.  To make it to
  this category, there are a few things a tool should have in
  addition to what the enhanced editors do.  The main extra in
  these tools is much more assistance in creating valid XML.  In
  most cases, the tools simply disallow creation of invalid XML,
  while providing intuitive assistance about what elements and
  attributes can occur at a given place in a document.  The other
  thing the XML IDE's to is add a wider variety of views of your
  XML documents, each suited to different specific purpose and
  type of document.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Icon Information Systems <cite>XML Spy</cite>:</strong> <cite>XML Spy</cite> is another
  commercial tool for Win32; this one costing about $150.  When
  editing an XML document (or other filetype), <cite>XML Spy</cite> provides
  you with two basic views: the Text View (which looks basically
  like any text editor) and the Enhanced Grid View (which is a
  structured schematic representation of the document).  There is
  also a Browser View, which is just an external DDE call to
  Internet Explorer 5.5 or above; you cannot edit in the Browser
  View.
</p>
<p>
  In both views, you are presented with onscreen prompts and
  shortcuts for entering valid tags and attributes.  If you are
  usuing a DTD or Schema, there is a lot more help to provide.
  An information window describes the current context (element
  versus attribute, model, occurance rule).  Addition "Entry
  Helper" panes show what subtags, attributes and entities are
  available in a context, and assist you in entering required or
  allowed elements.  These helpers make your work a whole lot
  easier in trying to conform to a DTD (or in developing one).
</p>
<p>
  One built-in tool of <cite>XML Spy</cite> that felt like actual magic was
  its automatic DTD/Schema generation.  From a typeless XML
  document, <cite>XML Spy</cite> can do a remarkably good job of inferring
  the underlying DTD (and creating and attaching it).  I found
  that this generation was not perfect--for example it believed I
  was using an enumerated type where there was really just
  CDATA--but the "errors" it makes are no worse than those a
  person would who had only the XML document, and not the
  underlying design rules.  Cleaning up or customizing an
  <cite>XML Spy</cite> generated DTD is a lot quicker than writing one from
  scratch!
</p>
<p>
  Another nice interface device is an option in the Enhanced Grid
  View.  Most of the time, subtags are displayed in a
  hierarchical tree fashion.  However, <cite>XML Spy</cite> will
  automatically detect when it thinks some data could better be
  displayed in a Database/Table View of repeating element
  sequences.  You can also manually force one view or another.
  For working with what is basically tabular data to start with,
  using this view makes entering and understanding an XML
  document much easier.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>SoftQuad <cite>XMetal</cite>:</strong> <cite>XMetal</cite> is yet another commercial Win32
  product, this one at a rather pricey $500.  But it does quite a
  bit more than other tools.  Like <cite>XML Spy</cite>, <cite>XMetal</cite> enforces
  validity as you work with documents (if a DTD/Schema is used,
  of course).  <cite>XMetal</cite>'s default editing interface is called the
  "normal" or "wordprocessing" view, and will appear quite
  familiar at first to Microsoft Word users especially.  Like
  many tools of late, many of the toolbar icons, menu shortcuts,
  menus, and so on are copied from MS-Office.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the "normal" view, <cite>XMetal</cite> offers several
  others, with most features borrowed from SoftQuad's popular
  <cite>HotMetal</cite> HTML editor.  You can edit in a "plain text" view,
  which is just what you would expect in a text editor that knows
  a little bit about XML: you get some syntax highlighting, line
  numbers, Windows/CUA clipboard operations, search/replace
  (including basic regular expressions).  Unfortunately, and
  unnecessarily, some of XMetal's other capabilities are disabled
  in "plain text" view (i.e. "structure view" and
  context-sensitive element list).
</p>
<p>
  The view that SoftQuad first invented (AFAIK) is the "tags on"
  view.  This one is interesting, and quite useful.  Each tag in
  the document--opening and closing--is represented by an arrow-
  like icon that contains the tag name.  The words inside the
  tags are rendered in the style of the "normal" view, i.e. with
  different fonts, weights, colors, etc.  This combination both
  lets you see without ambiguity what the markup structure of a
  document is, and also lets you see a good approximation of at
  least one likely final rendering of an XML document.
  Obviously, if the particular XML document is being used in a
  database style rather than in a book/article/documentation
  style, the rendering has less literal significance (but it can
  still visually highlight categories of information in the XML).
  The element rendering is configurable using CSS.
</p>
<p>
  Another optional view is available as a separate pane.  The
  "structure view" is a hierarchical tree representation of the
  document being edited in the main pane.  Navigation is
  synchronized between the two panes.  While "plain text" or
  "tags on" view will show you the tag information, the
  "structure view" helps make it more explicit.  The structure
  view itself can take on multiple appearances, some more useful
  than others, but generally the options involve some helpful
  nested indentation and/or icons.
</p>
<p>
  The one thing really missing from <cite>XMetal</cite> is built-in XSLT
  support.  You can call external programs, and put that call in
  the menus; but for $500 one expects every bell-and-whistle
  included.  I would also quibble with SoftQuad's reliance on the
  MSXML DLL that many Win32 tools seem to use (I've had many
  problems with that beta DLL).
</p>
<h3>Worth Mentioning</h3>
 <p>
  A few other tools are worth mentioning in passing.  The column
  will not have space to provide complete reviews or
  descriptions, but the reader can at least investigate further.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Morphon</cite> is a commercial Java XML editor/IDE.  It is still in
  free betas as of this writing, but the release version is
  expected to cost around $150.  <cite>Morphon</cite> presents a number of
  views, and is generally similar to <cite>XMetal</cite> or <cite>XML Spy</cite>.  Like
  <cite>XMetal</cite>, <cite>Morphon</cite> relies on CSS2 for visual "WYSYWIG"
  presentation of documents.  Betas have been a little unstable,
  but a lot of that depends of JVM issues.  Being Java-based,
  <cite>Morphon</cite> is likely to have far better cross-platform support
  than the Win32-only products.
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Xeena</cite> is a Java XML editor, like <cite>Morphon</cite>.  But <cite>Xeena</cite> has
  the nice extra feature of being free, and part of IBM
  alphaWorks' range of tools.  Editing with <cite>Xeena</cite> is somewhat
  more restricted than with the best IDE's.  You get good
  validation enforcement, and the "hierarchical tree plus line
  view" as in <cite>XML Notepad</cite> and <cite>XML Instance</cite>.  But <cite>Xeena</cite> is
  not really as friendly for working with prose-oriented XML
  documents as are <cite>Morphon</cite> and <cite>XMetal</cite>.  Like most IBM Java
  technologies, however, I have found <cite>Xeena</cite> to be stable and
  fast (which is more than is true of most Java applications).
</p>
<p>
  <cite>Conglomerate</cite> is a free-software project based on GTK+.  It
  compiles fairly easily on Linux, and in principle should on
  Windows also (since GTK is available).  There is good news and
  bad news here.  <cite>Conglomorate</cite> has the <em>absolutely</em> best
  interface concept I have encountered for working with
  prose-oriented XML documents.  It does not attempt to render
  character-level elements with CSS, but instead uses labelled
  and colored "underscores" for such elements.  Block-level
  elements, in turn, are identified with similarly rendered
  vertical color blocks.  Take a look at the homepage for
  screenshots.  The bad news is that <cite>Conglomorate</cite> is still
  basically alpha-level software.  It crashes, and needs features
  added.  But it is one of the most promising starts I have seen;
  I hope someone (maybe a reader) advances the development of
  <cite>Conglomorate</cite> to being a free-software end-all XML editor/IDE.
</p>
<p>
  A last possibility is worth considering.  <cite>Corel WordPerfect
  2000</cite> builds on the SGML support in earlier <cite>WordPerfect</cite>
  version to provide nicely structured XML support and
  validation.  It is a powerful wordprocessor in general, and by
  using it, you can use the same tool for XML document
  development.
