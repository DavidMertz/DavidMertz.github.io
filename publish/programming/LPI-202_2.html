<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  </strong> Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  <strong> Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  </strong> Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  <strong> Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  </strong> Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)
</p>
<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Mail and News", the second of seven tutorials covering
  intermediate network administration on Linux. In this tutorial, we
  discuss how to use Linux as a mail server and a news server. Email is
  probably the main use of the Internet, overall; and Linux perhaps the
  best platform for running email services on. This tutorial addresses
  mail transport, local mail filtering , and mailing list maintenance
  software. Server software for the NNTP protocol is discussed briefly.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About Mail and News
</h3>
 <p>
  The breadth of use of Linux for mail and news servers has led to the
  development of improved tools over time. When the LPI certification
  exams were developed, the most popular tools were <code>sendmail</code> for mail
  transport, <code>procmail</code> for local mail handling, <code>majordomo</code> for mailing
  lists, and <code>innd</code> (InterNetNews daemon) for NNTP. The last of these is
  still probably the default choice; however, despite its technical
  strengths, the NNTP protocol has been somewhat eclipsed by either
  email mailing list or web-based discussion forums.
</p>
<p>
  Of other tools, <code>sendmail</code> and <code>procmail</code> are still widely used,
  although not as ubiquitous as they might have been in 2001. However,
  the most popular upgrade/replacement for <code>sendmail</code> is <code>postfix</code> which
  contains facilities for backwards compatibility with <code>sendmail</code>. The
  field for local mail handling is well populated, but <code>procmail</code> is
  largely used. On the other hand, <code>majordomo</code> is a minor anachronism
  nowadays. Just as <code>majordomo</code> largely replaced the ealier <code>listserv</code>
  software, more recently <code>mailman</code> has mostly eclipsed <code>majordomo</code>.
  However, to match current LPI topic areas, this tutorial will still
  discuss <code>majordomo</code>.
</p>
<h3>Other resources
</h3>
 <p>
  As with most Linux tools, it is always useful to examine the manpages
  for any utilities discussed. Versions and switches might change
  between utility or kernel version, or with different Linux
  distributions. For more in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
 <a href="http://www.tldp.org/.">http://www.tldp.org/.</a>  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's <cite>TCP/IP Network
  Administration</cite>, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).
</p>
<h3>Configuring Mailing Lists</h3>
 <h3>What does Majordomo do?
</h3>
 <p>
  A mailing list manager program is basically a local extension for a
  mail transport program (MTA) such as <code>sendmail</code>.  Basically, the MTA
  running on a system passes off a set of address to the control of the
  mailing list manager, and the mailing list manager modifies, processes
  and perhaps remails the messages it receives.  Some messages received
  by a mailing list manager are messages meant for distribution to the
  mailing list itself (perhaps needing to be verified for permission to
  distribute to the list(s); other messages are control messages that
  change the status of the mailing list, such as the subscription
  options of a particular subscriber.  A mailing list manager does not
  perform mail deliver itself, but passes that function to its
  supporting MTA.
</p>
<p>
  As the introduction to this tutorial stated, Majordomo is not
  currently the state-of-the-art choice for mailing lists.  Rather, the
  best choice for a new installation of a mailing list is probably
  <code>Mailman</code> (http://www.list.org/).  Majordomo, however, is still
  perfectly functional, and is installed on many older systems that
  continue to operate without problem (sometimes supporting lists that
  have been operational for many years).
</p>
<p>
  There is a wrinkle with Majordomo versions, however. Some years ago, a
  rewrite of the Majordomo 1.x series was started, called Majordomo2.
  Unfortunately, that rewrite fizzled out without ever reaching release
  status. While Majordomo2 (in a beta version) may be used in a very
  small number of systems, Majordomo 1.9.5 is the most recent stable
  version, and the version that will be discussed in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>Installing Majordomo
</h3>
 <p>
  You can obtain an archive of the Majordomo software at
  &lt<a href="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/&gt;.">http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/&gt;.</a> The most recent, and probably
  final, stable version is 1.9.5. After unpacking a file named like
  <code>majordomo-1.94.5.tgz</code>, be sure to read the file <code>INSTALL</code> carefully.
  You will need to follow all the steps it describes to getting a
  working Majordomo system. Building the system uses the usual <code>make;
  make install</code> steps of most source installs, but also needs <code>make
  install-wrapper</code>. The install can and should verify itself with a
  command like <code>cd /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5; ./wrapper config-test</code>
  (the <code>make install</code> will provide you with details as a message).
</p>
<p>
  Before building, you will need to modify the <code>Makefile</code>, and create
  and/or modify <code>majordomo.cf</code>.  The latter file can be copied from
  <code>sample.cf</code> in the source distribution as a starting point.  In the
  <code>Makefile</code>, a number of environment variables are set, but the most
  critical and subtle of these is probably <code>W_GROUP</code>.  This is the
  <em>numeric</em> gid of the group Majordomo will run under, almost always the
  group <code>daemon</code>.  The gid for <code>daemon</code> is 1 on most systems, but be
  sure to check using:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ id daemon
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)

</pre></div><p>
  Other variables in <code>Makefile</code> include <code>PERL</code> for the path to the
  interpreter, and <code>W_HOME</code> for the location where Majordomo will be
  installed.
</p>
<p>
  Your new <code>majordomo.cf</code> file also needs to be edited before the <code>make
  isntall</code>.  Mostly the Perl variables that need to be modified appear
  near the top of the file.  Definitely adjust <code>$whereami</code> and
  <code>$homedir</code>, and examine the others to make sure they are sensible.
</p>
<h3>Telling Sendmail to use Majordomo
</h3>
 <p>
  The final step in installation is convincing Sendmail to talk with
  Majordomo. Within the <code>/etc/sendmail.cf</code> file, this will involve a
  line like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>OA/path/to/majordomo/majordomo.aliases

</pre></div><p>
  If you use the M4 processor to generate Sendmail configuration files,
  you can use a line like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>define(`ALIAS_FILE',`/etc/aliases,/path/to/majordomo/majordomo.aliases')

</pre></div><p>
  The sample <code>majordomo.aliases</code> contains some sample values:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>majordomo:  "|/usr/test/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo"
majordomo-owner: you
owner-majordomo: you
test:           "|/usr/test/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper resend -l test test-list"
test-list:      :include:/usr/test/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/test
owner-test:     you
test-owner:     you
test-request:   you

</pre></div><p>
  These, of course, need to be customized for your particular setup.
  In particular "you" means the name of the list administrator (who is
  not necessarily the overall system administrator).
</p>
<h3>Creating a new Majordomo list
</h3>
 <p>
  The sample setup given above created a list called <code>test</code>, with
  addresses for <code>test-owner</code>, <code>test-request</code>, etc. for administering the
  list.  Presumably, in real use you will want lists with other names.
  To do that, do the following:
</p>
<p>
  * Switch to the directory <code>$listdir</code>, as defined in <code>majordomo.cf</code>.
</p>
<p>
  * Create a files called <code>my-list-name</code> and <code>my-list-name.info</code> (adjust
</p>
<blockquote>
    appropriately); <code>chmod</code> them to 664.  The latter file contains an
    introduction to the list.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Create several aliases in your <code>majordomo.aliases</code> file, following
</p>
<blockquote>
    the pattern of the "test" examples.  E.g. <code>foo-owner</code>, <code>foo</code>,
    <code>foo-request</code> and so on.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Send requests to "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "signoff", and so on
</p>
<blockquote>
    member of the list.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Create an archive directory in the location specified by the
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>$filedir</code> and <code>$filedir_suffix</code> variables.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Create a digest subdirectory under <code>$digest_work_dir</code>. Use the same
</p>
<blockquote>
    name as the digest list (example: test-digest).
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Make sure everything is owned by user <code>majordomo</code>, group
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>majordomo</code>, and writable by both owner and group (i.e., mode 664
    for files and mode 775 for directories).
</blockquote>
<p>
  * Issue a <code>config &lt;listname&gt; &lt;listname&gt;.admin</code> command to
</p>
<blockquote>
    Majordomo.  This will cause it to create a default configuration
    file for the list, and send it back to you.
</blockquote>
<h3>Using Sendmail</h3>
 <h3>What does Sendmail do?
</h3>
 <p>
  The short answer is that Sendmail is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA); it
  routes, modifies, and delivers mail message across heterogeneous mail
  systems. In a history somewhat parallel to that with mailing list
  software, Sendmail has a "permanent beta" version called Sendmail X
  that is intended as an upgrade/replacement for the stable Sendmail 8.x
  series; however, much as Mailman has largely supplanted Majordomo,
  several MTA have partially eclipsed Sendmail. The chief such new MTA
  is Postfix (http://www.postfix.org/), but Qmail
  (http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html) and Exim (http://www.exim.org/) are also
  relatively widely used.  Nonetheless, Sendmail probably still remains,
  by a narrow margin, the most widely used MTA on Linux systems.  As of
  September 16, 2005, the latest stable release of Sendmail was 8.13.5.
</p>
<p>
  The long answer to what Sendmail is a very long answer indeed. Not
  just one, but many, books have been written on Sendmail. See
 <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/books.html">http://www.sendmail.org/books.html</a> for a list of available books.  The
  most comprehensive of these is <cite>Sendmail, Third Edition</cite> by Bryan
  Costales with Eric Allman, Third Edition December 2002, ISBN:
  1-56592-839-3.  At 1232 pages, this book covers quite a lot more than
  this short tutorial can touch on.
</p>
<p>
  While Sendmail in principle supports a number of mail transport
  protocols such as UUCP, by far the most widely used one is Simple Mail
  Transport Protocol (SMTP), which here includes Extended SMTP (ESMTP)
  for enhanced MIME encoded message bodies. At heart, mail which is not
  forward to other SMTP hosts is delivered to the local system, by
  putting messages in local files. Local Mail User Agents (MUAs) read
  messages that Sendmail (or another MTA) puts in local files (and often
  also fetch mail using POP3 or IMAP), but generally call on Sendmail to
  deliver outgoing messages. Some MUAs, however, themselves directly
  communicate with SMTP servers (such as Sendmail instances, local or
  remote) rather than placing messages in in the Sendmail queue for
  later processing.  Usually the Sendmail queue is in
  <code>/var/spool/mqueue/</code>
</p>
<h3>Installing Sendmail
</h3>
 <p>
  First thing, obtain a copy of the current Sendmail software from
  &lt<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/&gt;,">http://www.sendmail.org/&gt;,</a> e.g. <code>sendmail.8.13.5.tar.gz</code>. Unpack it
  as usual. Unlike many applications that use the <code>make;make install</code>
  pattern, building Sendmail is peformed with <code>sh Build</code>. After the
  initial build, <code>cd</code> to the <code>cf/cf/</code> subdirectory; copy a suitable
  <code>*.mc</code> file <code>sendmail.mc</code>; customize <code>sendmail.mc</code>; and run the
  following to generate a <code>sendmail.cf</code> file:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ m4 ../m4/cf.m4 sendmail.mc &gt; sendmail.cf

</pre></div><p>
  You may also use the shortcut <code>sh Build sendmail.cf</code>. This may seem
  mysterious, but what either of these commands do is generate an actual
  Sendmail configuration from a more readable format using the M4 macro
  processor. Actual <code>sendmail.cf</code> files, though editable ASCII, are
  quite cryptic, and should only be modified by hand minimally.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, copy the <code>sendmail</code> binary from a location like
  <code>obj.Linux.2.6.10-5-386.i686/sendmail/sendmail</code> to its final location
  (backup an old one if it exists), typically <code>/usr/sbin/</code>; and copy
  your <code>sendmail.cf</code> file to <code>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</code>. The latter can
  also be peformed in the <code>cf/cf/</code> subdirectory with <code>sh Build
  install-cf</code>. You will probably need to <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> to obtain file
  permissions for the relevant directories.
</p>
<p>
  A number of utilities come with Sendmail: makemap, mailstats, etc.
  Each corresponding directory has a README, and can be installed with
  <code>sh Build install</code> run from the subdirectory.
</p>
<h3>The <code>sendmail.cf</code> file
</h3>
 <p>
  The main complexity, and the main function, of Sendmail is in its
  <code>sendmail.cf</code> file.  This configuration file contains some settings
  for the Sendmail environment, but principally it contains patterns for
  addresses to rewrite and/or deliver by certain mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
  Two rewrite mechanism that may be configured are the <code>genericstable</code>
  and <code>virtusertable</code> which let you map local users to and from external
  addresses.  For either mapping, you first create an aliases file as
  plain text, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>File: outbound</h4><pre>
david                     david.mertz@gmail.com
root                      root@gnosis.cx
dqm@gnosis.lan            david.mertz@gmail.com

</pre></div><p>
  Or for incoming mail mapped to local accounts, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>File: inbound</h4><pre>
david@mail.gnosis.cx      david
david@smtp.gnosis.cx      david
david@otherdomain.net     david
@mail.gnosis.cx           %1@external-host.com
owner@list.gnosis.cx      owner%3
jax@bar.com	            error:5.7.0:550 Address invalid

</pre></div><p>
  To compile these aliases, use the <code>makemap</code> utility:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ makemap dbm /etc/mail/virtusertable &lt; inbound
$ makemap hash /etc/mail/genericstable &lt; outbound

</pre></div><p>
  Enabling use of these maps can be configured using M4 macros in
  <code>sendmail.cf</code> (of in whatever configuration file you use).
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>DOMAIN(gnosis.cx)dnl
FEATURE(`virtusertable', `dbm /etc/mail/virtusertable')dnl
FEATURE(`genericstable', `hash /etc/mail/genericstable')dnl
GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE(`/etc/mail/generics-domains')dnl

</pre></div><p>
  A number of things are going on here.  The <code>DOMAIN</code> macro indicates
  that a file like <code>cf/domain/gnosis.cx.m4</code> is used for additional
  macros.  The <code>FEATURE</code> macros enable use of the <code>virtusertable</code> and
  <code>genericstable</code>.  The <code>GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE</code> macro defines the
  domains that qualify for remapping for names in <code>genericstable</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Rewriting will follow all the rules indicated.  In test mode
  (<code>sendmail -bt</code>) you can examine the rewriting that is performed for
  specific addresses.  For example, using <code>genericstable</code>, mail to the
  local user <code>david</code> will be delivered to <code>david.mertz@gmail.com</code>
  externally.  Assuming <code>localhost</code> is defined in
  <code>/etc/mail/generics-domains</code>, mail to <code>david@localhost</code> will go to the
  same place.
</p>
<p>
  In the other direction, mail coming in for <code>david@mail.gnosis.cx</code> will
  be rewritten and delivered to local user <code>david</code>.  Multiple domains
  can be manipulated by Sendmail at the same time, so
  <code>david@otherdomain.net</code> will also be delivered locally.  The full
  power comes in some of the wildcard symbols.  Any mail send to
  <code>mail.gnosis.cx</code> that is not specifically directed to a local user
  will be forwarded to the same username at <code>external-host.com</code>.  But
  that's a simple pattern.  More interestingly, the <code>%3</code> can be used to
  expand multiple extra name information, so
  <code>owner-foo@list.gnosis.cx</code> and <code>owner-bar@list.gnosis.cx</code> will
  be delivered to local users <code>owner-foo</code> and <code>owner-bar</code>, respectively
  (unless they undergo further rewriting).  Presumably, these local
  users might be mailing list processing systems or other automated
  message handlers.  As a special case, you can raise an error for a
  given address rather than rewrite it further.
</p>
<p>
  Really what we have looked at just scratches the surface of the
  rewriting rules you can add to Sendmail, but they give you an initial
  feel.  Buy one of the large books on the topic to learn more details.
</p>
<h3>Running Sendmail
</h3>
 <p>
  Sendmail can run in a number of modes.  The most common mode is as a
  daemon that stays in the background and periodically.  For example,
  running:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -q10m

</pre></div><p>
  Tells Sendmail to run as a daemon, and check its queue every ten
  minutes.  You can also run Sendmail a single time to process the queue
  at once, but not daemonize:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ /usr/sbin/sendmail -q

</pre></div><p>
   As we mentioned above, Sendmail has a test mode to examine address
   rewriting rules, e.g. (from the Linux Network Administrators Guide,
   http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_network/x15583.html):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ /usr/sbin/sendmail -bt
ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter &lt;ruleset&gt; &lt;address&gt;
&gt; 3,0 isaac@vstout.vbrew.com
rewrite: ruleset   3   input: isaac @ vstout . vbrew . com
rewrite: ruleset  96   input: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com &gt;
rewrite: ruleset  96 returns: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset   3 returns: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset   0   input: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset 199   input: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset 199 returns: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset  98   input: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset  98 returns: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset 198   input: isaac &lt; @ vstout . vbrew . com . &gt;
rewrite: ruleset 198 returns: $# local $: isaac
rewrite: ruleset   0 returns: $# local $: isaac

</pre></div><h3>Managing Mail Traffic</h3>
 <h3>What does Procmail do?
</h3>
 <p>
  Procmail is a mail processor.  That term probably means nothing at all
  to the unitiated, so we need some explanation.  Basically, once
  Sendmail or another MTA has delivered mail to a local mailbox, you
  might use a MUA to process the mail in your inbox.  You save some
  messages to various folders; you delete others; you forward other
  messages to various interested parties; you repl to others; and so on.
  Doing these tasks in an MUA is a manual and interactive process, and
  is potentially time consuming.
</p>
<p>
  Procmail is a program that can automatically do these tasks for you
  whenever the required processing can be stated in a rule-driven way.
  Obviously, when you write back to your mother about her personal
  email, some personal attention is required; but for a large class of
  other messages, it is useful to specify in advance exactly what you
  would like to happen when a given message is received. The rules that
  can drive automated message handling might involve specific
  pattern-based header field, certain contents in a message body, or
  even calls out to more specific and specialized external programs such
  as statistical spam filters.
</p>
<h3>Enabling Procmail
</h3>
 <p>
  Procmail probably came installed with your Linux distribution.  If not
  you can obtain the source archive at &lt<a href="http://www.procmail.org/&gt;.">http://www.procmail.org/&gt;.</a>  As
  of this writing, the latest version is 3.22.  You can also probably
  install Procmail as a binary using the install system of your Linux
  distribution (e.g. on Debian: <code>apt-get install procmail</code>).  Building
  from source is a straightforward <code>make install</code>.  All Procmail needs
  to operate is the <code>procmail</code> binary and a <code>~/.procmailrc</code>
  configuration file (or possibly a global <code>/etc/procmailrc</code>).
</p>
<p>
  Beyond installing Procmail in the first place, you need to get your
  local mail system to utilize Procmail.  An older mechanism to process
  mail through Procmail is to use a <code>.forward</code> file; this will still
  often work on a per-user basis.  Usually a user will create a file
  <code>~/.forward</code> that contains something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>|/usr/local/bin/procmail

</pre></div><p>
  This will pipe each incoming message to Procmail. However, a better
  and more common way to utilize Procmail is to tell your MTA to talk
  directly to Procmail in the first place. In Sendmail, this involved
  enabling the <code>local_procmail</code> feature, e.g. put the following in your
  <code>sendmail.mc</code> file:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>FEATURE(`local_procmail', `/usr/bin/procmail', `procmail -Y -a $h -d $u')

</pre></div><p>
  Once Procmail is enabled at all, it needs a file <code>~/.procmailrc</code> that
  contains the set of rules it processes in handling a given message.
  Procmail is not a daemon, but rather a text processing tool that
  accepts exactly one email message at a time via STDIN.
</p>
<h3>Rules in ~/.procmailrc
</h3>
 <p>
  At heart, Procmail is just a set of regular expression recipes. You
  may also define environment variables in the same fashion as in a
  shell script. Recipes are executed in order, but flags may be used to
  execute a particular condition only if the prior condition is
  satisfied (<code>A</code>), or is not satisfied (<code>E</code>). Some Procmail recipes are
  delivery recipes, and others are non-delivery recipes; the former
  terminates processing of a given message, unless the <code>c</code> flag is given
  to explicitly continue processing. The most common action of a recipe
  is probably to store a message in a named mailbox, but you may also
  pipe a message to another program or forward the message to a list of
  addresses.
</p>
<p>
  A recipe usually starts with a lock (optionally with a specific lock
  file, otherwise it is done automatically) and some flags, followed by
  some rules, and then by exactly one action. I.e.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>:0 [flags] [ : [locallockfile] ]
&lt;zero or more conditions (one per line)&gt;
&lt;exactly one action line&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Of particular note are the implied flag <code>H</code> to match the header, and
  <code>B</code> to match the body. Patterns normally are case-insensitive, but the
  <code>D</code> flag can force case-sensitive matching.
</p>
<p>
  If a condition begins with <code>*</code>, everything after that character is an
  <code>egrep</code> expression.  Otherwise, if a line starts with <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> it
  checks the size of a message as smaller or larger than a given number
  of bytes.  The <code>$</code> prefix allows shell substitutions in
</p>
<p>
  An action that is simply a file name saves a message to that mailbox.
  Use the special pseudo-file <code>/dev/null</code> to delete a message. A pipe
  character (<code>|</code>) passes the message to another program, such as the

  The exclamation prefix (<code>!</code>) forwards a message as an action (but
  negates a condition in a rule). Some examples:

 <h3>What does InterNetNews do?
</h3>
 <p>
  NNTP is a nice protocol for "pull" distribution of messages to any
  users who are interested in a given topic. The Usenet is a large
  collection of "newsgroups", on thousands of different topics, which
  distribute messages via NNTP. Being a pull protocol, and NNTP server
  gathers the current message available from a decentralized network of
  servers, selecting only those newsgroups that the site administrator
  choooses to include. When a new message is posted to a given
  newsgroup, it propogates non-hierarchically from the server the user
  directly connects to all the other servers on the internet interested
  in subscribing to that particular newsgroup.
</p>
<p>
  From an end user perspective, a mailing list can appear very similar
  to a newsgroup.  In either case, the user composes and posts messages,
  and reads messages written by other people.  In the ancient days of
  the Usenet and the Internet, mailing lists were not as capable of
  presenting discussion topics in a "threaded" fashion as newsgroups do
  automatically.  But for a number of years, mail clients have done a
  good job of inferring the discussion threads within mailing lists.
  The main difference between newsgroups and mailing lists is in their
  underlying network protocol.  A mailing list still relies on one
  centralized mail server that accepts all the messages destined for a
  particular list, and distributes that message via email to all users
  who have indicated and interest (and have been approved, either by
  automatic or human moderated subscription mechanisms).  In contrast,
  NNTP connects every node to every other one without relying on a
  central server; each NNTP server simply talks to the other servers
  "nearby", and rather rapidly, this reaches the whole world.
</p>
<p>
  InterNetNews (INN) is an NNTP server that was first written in 1992,
  and has been actively maintained since then. As of this writing, INN
  is at version 2.4.1. The home page for INN includes releases and
  documentation and is at &lt<a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/inn/&gt;.">http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/inn/&gt;.</a>
</p>
<h3>Setting up INN
</h3>
 <p>
  After obtaining and unpacking the current source release, builing INN
  is a straightforward <code>./configure; make; make install</code> sequence.  To
  build INN, you will need to have Perl and yacc (or bison) installed.
  This will create a number of files, mostly in the <code>/usr/local/news/</code>
  directory (which you probably do not have if INN has not been
  installed previously).
</p>
<p>
  Before running the <code>innd</code> daemon (as user <code>news</code>), you will want to
  modify a number of configuration files. The full details will not fit
  in this tutorial section, but a longer tutorial on the full set of
  files needing attention (albeit being older, it is for SCO Unix, not
  for Linux; but most details remain the same) can be found at
  &lt<a href="http://www.kozubik.com/published/inn_tutorial.txt&gt;.">http://www.kozubik.com/published/inn_tutorial.txt&gt;.</a> Many of the
  permissions and quota issues will be handled by the make system, but
  you might want to double check these configurations.
</p>
<p>
  A file to pay particular attention to is the quota setup in
  <code>/usr/local/news/etc/storage.conf</code>.  This controls which newsgroups
  are subscribed to, and how much history from each newsgroup to
  maintain.  Once the quota is reached, older messages are purged from a
  given newsgroup (on the local server, not from Usenet as a whole).
  For example, it might contain:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Sample storage.conf configuration</h4><pre>
method cnfs {
      newsgroups: alt.binaries.*
      class: 1
      size: 0,1000000
      options: BINARIES
}

method cnfs {
      newsgroups: *
      class: 2
      size: 0,100000
      options: NOTBINRY
}

</pre></div><p>
  The "class" value specifies the order in which different rules are
  evaluated.
</p>
<p>
  Once all the various configuration files are tweaked, just running
  <code>innd</code> as a daemon (probably launched for an initialization script)
  monitors the upstream servers configured by <code>/usr/local/news/etc/innfeed.conf</code>,
  <code>/usr/local/news/etc/incoming.conf</code> and <code>/usr/local/news/etc/newsfeeds</code>.
