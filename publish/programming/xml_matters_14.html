<h1>Xml Matters #14: Those Awkward Limits Of Dom, Sax And Xslt</h1>

    The library <code>HaXml</code> creates native representation of XML
    documents as native recursive data structures in the
    functional language Haskell.  HaXml brings with it a set of
    powerful higher order functions for operating on these
    "datafied" XML documents.  Many of these HaXml techniques are
    far more elegant, compact, and powerful than one finds in
    familiar techniques like DOM, SAX, or XSLT.
</blockquote>
<h3>Conventional Limitations</h3>
 <p>
  The most common techniques for manipulating XML documents are
  DOM, SAX and XSLT.  These techniques have a distressing lack of
  unifying principles among them.  Everything one might want to
  do with XML is available in one of the major approaches, but
  when what you want to do crosses the boundaries of what each
  technique does best, it is far from clear how to approach a
  problem.  One is likely to wind up with a hodge-podge
  application in which various smaller transformations are
  chained together with heterogeneous techniques and tools.
</p>
<p>
  DOM melds everything XML into an OOP framework, at a level of
  abstraction higher than that of any particular programming
  language.  DOM is language-independent, and its "document
  object model" is provided by libraries in many general purpose
  programming languages.  In a sense, DOM is the language--it
  specifies all the methods and arguments, and the underlying
  general purpose language is just a little glue.  My utility
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, discussed in previous installments, provided a
  way of transforming XML documents into more native-feeling
  OOP-ified objects (in Python); largely in response to the
  somewhat artificial feel of DOM.
</p>
<p>
  SAX is similar to DOM in its language-neutrality, but it
  substitutes an event-driven and procedural model for the OOP
  framework of DOM.  SAX has the very nice feature that it is
  able to process XML documents as streams, acting upon each
  element and content as it is encountered.  But with its
  event-driven philosophy comes SAX' disadvantage of having no
  real concept of the data structures represented by XML
  documents.  One can build such structures in a concrete
  application, but even something so basic as a parent/child
  relationship must be represented in the vocabulary of the
  programming language that underlies a SAX library; SAX itself
  is blind to most of what is interesting about XML.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, XSLT is the familiar technique that, in a sense, best
  matches the structure of XML.  Perhaps reflecting this match,
  XSL documents are themselves XML document instances.  XSLT is a
  special-purpose <em>functional</em> programming language that allows
  one to specify transformations of XML documents into other
  things (especially, but not only, into other XML documents).
  Aside from the somewhat annoying verboseness of XSLT, it is
  limited in its expressiveness--the things you can say are
  expressed rather clearly (and functionally, not procedurally),
  but one quickly bumps up against all the things that one simply
  cannot say in XSLT.
</p>
<h3>A Simple And Typical Task</h3>
 <p>
  Let me describe a quite realistic scenario, that shows
  weaknesses in the common techniques.  XSLT is typically the
  most direct way to describe a transformation of an XML document
  into an output.  For example, we might want to create an HTML
  representation of an XML document.  Let us say we have an XML
  version of the <cite>I Ching</cite> that looks something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XML Version of the I Ching</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;IChing&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Some Hexagrams from the I Ching&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;hexagram&gt;
        &lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Ch'ien / The Creative&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;judgement&gt;
            The Creative works sublime success,
            Furthering through perseverance.
        &lt;/judgement&gt;
    &lt;/hexagram&gt;
    &lt;hexagram&gt;
        &lt;number&gt;2&lt;/number&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;K'un / The Receptive&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;judgement&gt;
            The Receptive brings about sublime success,
            Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
        &lt;/judgement&gt;
    &lt;/hexagram&gt;
    &lt;hexagram&gt;
        &lt;number&gt;3&lt;/number&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Chun / Difficulty at the Beginning&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;judgement&gt;
            Difficulty at the Beginning works supreme success,
            Furthering through perseverance.
        &lt;/judgement&gt;
    &lt;/hexagram&gt;
&lt;/IChing&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  To present this information in an HTML table, we might use
  something like the below XSLT instructions:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>XSLT Instructions for an I Ching HTML Table</h4><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/strict"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method="html" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="IChing"&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="title"/&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;&lt;table border="1"&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="hexagram"&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="number"&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="name"&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="judgement"&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match="*"&gt;&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  This XSLT seems simple and direct:  we just create a template to
  describe how we would like each element formatted.  What could
  be easier? The problem comes as soon as we want to filter or
  compute something for the output--something that is not
  included in the few comparisons available to XSLT.  For
  example, maybe we want (in a numerological spirit) to display
  only the even numbered hexagrams, or only the prime ones.  With
  XSLT, we are out of luck for something this simple.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, we might turn to DOM or SAX for the task.  This
  will work, but we first have to simply throw away the work that
  went into earlier XSLT transformations.  DOM or SAX are
  completely different models, and share no significant code or
  concepts with XSLT.  For something as simple as my toy
  stylesheet, it hardly matters; but for large production-quality
  transformations, we might lose a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, neither SAX nor DOM have particularly elegant or
  maintainable models for output.  In order to output the simple
  (filtered) HTML table described, we just have to litter our
  application code with <code>print</code> statements or <code>printf()</code>
  functions (or whatever our general language uses).  These
  output statements are themselves buried in conditional blocks
  that test for element types and other conditions.  In such
  code, there is no way to tell at a glance how the output flows
  or make sure that a <code>print "&lt;/tr&gt;" </code> is reached to correspond
  with every <code>print "&lt;tr&gt;" </code> that occurred earlier.  There is
  certainly no guarantee given by imperative or OOP code that our
  output HTML or XML will be well-formed (let alone valid).
</p>
<h3>A Uniform Solution</h3>
 <p>
  What would be ideal for XML transformations would be a system
  that both let us express output declaratively (as XSLT does)
  and lets us include arbitrary filters and computations (as the
  implementation languages underlying DOM and SAX do).  While we
  are at it, it couldn't hurt to be guaranteed the
  well-formedness, or even validity, of our output.  And a
  compact and direct syntax would be nice too.
</p>
<p>
  HaXml gives us everything requested in the previous paragraph.
  Actually, the power of HaXml is more general than was even
  asked for.  Taking advantage of the higher order combinatorial
  functions that a functional programming language like Haskell
  allows, we can arbitrarily combine multiple filters in
  specifying output.  In XSLT, each <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> acts as a
  sort of filter between the input and output.  But the only real
  combination of filters created by an XSL file is a union on all
  the filters.  In contrast, HaXml lets us specify much more fine
  grained chains of filters for each element of the output.
  Actually, much of the same can be achieved using XPATH with
  XSLT, but HaXml is much more concise, and strictly more
  powerful.
</p>
<p>
  As well providing numerous combinators, HaXml allows the
  inclusion of arbitrary computations in the Haskell language as
  part of the filtering.  An extra bonus is that output can be
  specified in a much more coherent block that allows readable
  intermixing of output terms with filtering conditions.  The
  result is much more concise than XSLT, and has fewer
  punctuation symbols to make visual scanning difficult:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>HaXml program to output an I Ching HTML Table</h4><pre>
module Main where
import XmlLib
-- Concise XSLT-like specification of output
main = processXmlWith (hexagrams `o` tag "IChing")
hexagrams =
    html [
      hhead [htitle [keep /&gt; tag "title" /&gt; txt] ],
      hbody [htableBorder [rows `o` children `with` tag "hexagram"] ]
    ]
htableBorder = mkElemAttr "TABLE" [("BORDER",("1"!))]
rows f =
    let
      num = keep /&gt; tag "number" /&gt; txt
      nam = keep /&gt; tag "name" /&gt; txt
      jdg = keep /&gt; tag "judgement" /&gt; txt
    in
      if (condition (num f) (nam f) (jdg f))
      then hrow [hcol [num], hcol [nam], hcol [jdg]] f
      else []
condition num nam jdg = isPrime (makeInt num)

-- Supporting computations for rows condition
makeInt = stringToInt . unwrap      -- Turn [Content] into an Integer
unwrap [(CString b c)] = c          -- Turn [Content] into a String
stringToInt = revToInteger.reverse  -- Turn a String into an Integer
    where
    revToInteger = toInteger . revToInt
    revToInt []  = 0
    revToInt (d:ds) = digitToInt d + (10*(revToInt ds))
isPrime = ordSearch (sieve [2..])   -- ordered search of Sieve of Eratosthenes
    where
    ordSearch (x:xs) n
        | x &lt; n     = ordSearch xs n
        | x == n    = True
        | otherwise = False
    sieve (x:xs) = x : sieve [y | y &lt;- xs, y `mod` x &gt; 0]

</pre></div><p>
  As with XSLT, definitions may occur in any order.  The first
  twenty lines of the code specify the output format, with
  some definitions broken out into supporting functions, simply
  for readability.  In Haskell syntax, a function is whatever
  thing occurs to the left of an equal sign, and the definition
  is to the right of the equal sign.  The <code>where</code> and <code>let</code>
  clauses specify what we might call "inner functions" in other
  languages.  The first lines are conceptually very much like the
  XSLT approach.  But as an improvement, the HaXml version lets
  us define ad hoc filters at each point where we need it.  For
  example, one filter is:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>rows `o` children `with` tag "hexagram"

</pre></div><p>
  The <code>`o`</code> is somewhat fancifully called "Irish Composition",
  and can also be pronounced "of".  <code>rows</code> is our very own filter
  that we have defined out of convenience; we are just as free to
  reuse <code>rows</code> as to use any of the standard filters, and in
  unlimited combination.
</p>
<p>
  The latter half of the program contains a few computational
  functions.  One nice example is a six line primality test that
  does a lot to illustrate the power and elegance of Haskell as a
  language.  But as the program is structured, the function
  <code>condition</code> could equally well perform any tests it wanted on
  the Content of the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;judgement&gt;</code>
  elements.  "Content" is a special data type, so the first thing
  we need to do is <code>unwrap</code> the String contained in a Content.
  After that, we can convert it to an Integer, and test it (or do
  whatever else we want with it).
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot more details to the HaXml library--and learning
  Haskell itself requires a learning curve for programmers
  accustomed to imperative and OOP styles of programming.  But if
  one limits one's interest to just the capabilities one would
  find in XSLT, the top half of the example program is quite easy
  to expand upon (I would argue, with less of a learning curve
  than XSLT, while using a similar functional style).  Not only
  is the syntax more readable than XSLT, but one holds in reserve
  learning how to do the sort of thing in the bottom half of the
  program (and much more).
</p>
<h3>Enforcing Validity</h3>
 <p>
  In the above example, an XML document was treated as a generic
  tree structure.  For most purposes, doing this is the easiest
  and quickest approach.  But HaXml provides something else that
  is totally unique.  If one has a DTD for a document type one
  plans to work with, a set of native Haskell data structures can
  be generated from a DTD.  From that point forward, applications
  can be written that utilize the native DTD in their
  manipulations.  The generation mentioned involves several
  steps.  The first thing is to <em>create</em> the data structure as a
  module, something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Create a HaXml data structure from a DTD</h4><pre>
% DtdToHaskell MyFile.DTD MyFileDTD.hs

</pre></div><p>
  Once that is available, one can write an application that
  handles XML documents that must conform to the DTD.  Such
  applications will generally contain at least the following
  lines:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Custom HaXml app for MyFile.DTD XML documents</h4><pre>
import Xml2Haskell (readXml)
import MyFileDTD
[...]

</pre></div><p>
  From there, one can use all the higher order techniques Haskell
  provides for dealing with recursive data structures.  The first
  thing, naturally, will probably be to <code>readXml</code> in order to
  work with a particular input XML document.
</p>
<p>
  A reader can be forgiven for thinking at this point, "so what?"
  It would appear that this is no different from a DOM
  approach--or even SAX--where one can perfectly well work with
  structured data, or even validate against a DTD.
</p>
<p>
  There is much more here than meets the eye.  Haskell, unlike
  almost all other programming languages, is <em>thoroughly</em> type
  safe about data structures.  It is quite simply <em>impossible</em> in
  Haskell to perform any computation on the generated data
  structure that would result in an invalid XML document.  In
  contrast, the best one can do in languages like C/C++, Java,
  Perl, Smalltalk, Python is do a sanity check (validation) on
  the way in, and another one on the way out, and hope everything
  goes well.  It might be possible in something like Eiffel to
  add enough contractual constraints on every "adder" and
  "deleter" to make sure DTD validity is maintained (or, with
  enough work, in all the mentioned languages), but doing so
  involves custom programming within every <code>.addSpamTag()</code>
  method.  Moreover, all the DTD can do in the mentioned
  languages is provide a "cheat sheet" for an application
  programmer to look at.
</p>
<p>
  With HaXml, the data structure generated programmatically from
  a DTD automatically includes every validity constraint.  Mind
  you, just enforcing the constraints doesn't make an application
  programmer write correct code; but at least any bad code that
  would result in invalid documents is caught at compile time.
  The other caveat, of course, is that programming a custom
  application that enforces validity is just plain going to be
  more work than programming one that does not need to do this.
  But for "mission critical" requirements, HaXml could well
  provide the quickest and safest path to the rigorous goal.
