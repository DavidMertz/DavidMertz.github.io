    This review of XML editors (and its followup) looks at the
    progress commercial tools have made in the year-and-a-half
    since I last looked at this category of tools.  These tools
    have progressed from largely cosmetic wrappers around text
    editors to fleshed-out development enviroments that hugely
    ease working with XML-oriented technologies.  This
    installment examines Java and MacOS applications.


INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This installment follows up on the last one, and reviews three
  more XML editors.  All the editors covered here are Win32
  specific products--it is conceivable they will run under WINE,
  SoftWindows, or the like, but this was not tested, and is not
  the developers' focus.  The XML editors I looked at in the last
  installment were for Java and MacOS; depending on the
  platform(s) you need to edit XML on, one installment or the
  other will probably be more relevant.

  Specifically, the last installment looked at Morphon and
  <oXygen/>, both for Java, and ElfData's XML Editor for MacOS.
  This installment follows up with evaluations of Altova's
  XML-Spy, Wattle Software's XMLWriter, and and NetBryx
  Technologies' EditML Pro.

  One general issue for the last round of reviewed products was
  their UI responsiveness.  Java can be slow, and REALBasic (used
  by ElfData) is similar in this respect.  I am happy to report
  that all the native Win32 products I have tested are quite
  zippy even on a very moderately configured Win98 laptop, with a
  PII-366Mhz and 64 megs or RAM.  -Stability- was sometimes an
  issue, and transformations and validation is not necessarily
  immediate--but the mundane interfaces were without noticable
  pauses.

  I commented in the last installment that I deliberately leave
  out any discussion of general text editors.  Some of these are
  quite good, and can include everything from XML syntax
  highlighting to template completion and menu customization.
  Moreover, what text editors do, they generally do in a more
  sophisticated and refined manner than do upstard specialized
  XML editors.  If you are happy editing XML in your current text
  editor, that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Then again, some
  of the XML editors really do make some common tasks a lot
  easier--if you do these things a lot, it is worth spending a
  few dollars on a custom tool.


WHAT MAKES A GOOD EDITOR?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There is a distinction that I have drawn in all of these XML
  editor reviews--even the early one in January 2001.  XML
  documents come in two broad types:  prose-oriented and
  data-oriented.  The requirements in editing each type of
  document are somewhat different.

  Prose-oriented documents borrow from XML's SGML roots.
  A prose format will typically have a number of rules for when
  sections, subsections, paragraphs, chapters, graphics, etc. can
  nest inside one another.  But also, typically, one uses inline,
  character-oriented markup for individual words and phrases
  (bold, emphasis, citation, links, etc).  DocBook is a famous
  and widely used example; IBM developerWorks internal article
  format is another example (I used both for testing).  In
  contrast, data-oriented documents have little text -as such-,
  but rather contain nested table-like structures of numeric
  values and simple names.  Data-oriented XML is often similar to
  RDBMS tables, and sometimes is generated from such databases.
  An ability to view XML as columns and rows is often important
  for data-oriented XML.

  Some XML editors have modes and views to accomodate different
  document types.  Some also have special capabilities to deal
  with widely used XML dialects, or with other techniques often
  used in dealing with XML documents.  If you have specialized
  requirements, consider whether a given product has
  customizations around that need.  Most XML editors know at the
  least how to automatically customize themselves to a novel
  DTD--what the customization consists of, of course, varies.


Corel's XMetal 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I managed to obtain a copy of XMetal 3 only after I had
  examined all the other products discussed here; therefore I
  have not done a direct feature-by-feature comparison of XMetal
  with other tools.  I looked at Softquad's XMetal in my 2001
  roundup, before Softquad was acquired by Corel.  I liked the
  product, mostly for its sophisticated and useful word
  processor-like view (with or without embedded graphic tag
  display).  Not a lot has changed in XMetal between version 2
  and 3.

  Of all the products I have reviewed, XMetal is the priciest,
  and it aims at a somewhat different audience than the others.
  The main focus of XMetal is not really to be a general-purpose
  XML editing tool, but rather to be a scriptable editing
  environment.  From what I can tell, Corel anticipates that
  developers will create complex custom editing applications
  using XMetal, and these will in turn be delivered to less
  technical users from whom the underlying XML is hidden, but for
  whom custom macros, buttons, menus, and other interfaces are
  configured.  XML Spy can also be used in a similar manner, but
  that is less of Altova's focus.  I did not evaluate XMetal in
  the application-development framework, but simply as an XML
  editing environment.

  The basic interface of XMetal is similar to that of XML Spy.
  Various panes are available to present projects, resources,
  insertable elements and attribute values.  Within the main
  document window, four views are available:  text view;
  wordprocessor view, wordprocessor-with-tags view, and IE-based
  preview.  I particularly like the option of seeing both visual
  font choices and structural tags at once--Morphon and XML Spy
  also have options to convey similar information.

  As well as the main document window, you can open a navigable
  tree window that shows the hierarchy of a document.  XMetal,
  like Morphon and unlike XML Spy, uses CSS to configure its
  graphical display, and comes with a tool to navigate and select
  CSS styles.  I prefer this use of CSS to an XSLT approach.  In
  addition, unlike all the tools the embed Internet Explorer for
  CSS views, XMetal displays inline CSS elements correctly (in an
  editable view).

  Beyond some useful editing views, XMetal becomes a little thin
  unless you are willing to custom-program an application.  XMetal
  comes with a thick reference book on scripting its environment
  in multiple languages, but lacks built-in convenience menus for
  XSLT operations, sophisticated searches, FOP output to PS/PDF,
  or special XML dialects.  Basic validation and well-formedness
  checking is about as far as it goes.  Mind you, the API is
  sufficient to script all of this and more--but that's a
  development project, not a ready-to-use tool.  Even within its
  customization focus, I wouldn't mind seeing some greater
  built-in conveniences for the cost.


Wattle Software's XMLWriter 1.21.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I had looked at XMLWriter in my 2001 roundup, and looking again
  now (at version 1.21), little has changed since then.  The
  forthcoming version 2.0 looks like it may add some significant
  updates; its ETA is already past the time a Wattle
  representative indicated to me.  I will keep an eye open for
  developments.

  The basic idea in _XMLWriter_ is close to a text editor, with
  some XML specific extras thrown in.  The only editable view of a
  document is a textual view, with syntax-highlighting.  There
  are several preview modes that utilize MSXML/IE DLLs--a
  collapsible tree, a CSS display, and XSLT transformation view.
  All of these preview views are simply embedded Internet
  Explorer panes--warts and all.  In particular, IE still does
  not render inline CSS elements correctly (Mozilla and Opera do
  perfectly in this), which makes the usefulness of the view much
  weaker for prose-oriented documents.  Of course, if you happen to
  have developed an XSLT sheet that targets (X)HTML, that is
  displayed well.  There is no support at all for data-oriented
  editing.

  {Screenshot of XMLWriter:
     http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/XMLWriter.png}

  Beyond the text editor features, _XMLWriter_ has options for
  validation and well-formedness checking, for XSLT conversion,
  for browser preview, and a concept of "projects" (collections
  of related files:  XML, XSL, CSS, Schema, etc).  But compared
  to most other products I have looked at, the extras are week.
  The TagBar is a somewhat clumsy tool for inserting elements;
  there is no help in entering attributes; validation is strictly
  post-facto; the search dialog is extremely crude--no regular
  expressions, XPath, or even element/attribute/value specific
  searching.  Almost everything that _XMLWriter_ does, a general
  (free) programmers editor like JEdit does better.

  XMLWriter version 1.21 will set you back AU$75 (about US$40)--I
  do not know how version 2.0 will be priced.


NetBryx Technologies EditML Pro 2.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  EditML Pro is another fairly simple Win32 XML editor, but a bit
  more sophisticated than XMLWriter.  Like XMLWriter, is a
  comparatively thin wrapper around the MSXML and IE DLLs, with
  the various bugs that come with that.  Unfortunately, EditML
  Pro introduces a few bugs of its own, such as a "DTD Element
  View" pane that will constantly open itself despite efforts to
  disable it (perhaps borrowing that behavior from the infamously
  annoying MS-Office paperclip).

  You get several views in EditML Pro, each arranged in tabbed
  panes of the window associated with the XML document.  An
  MDI-style interface is used to manage multiple documents, each
  window has its own tabs.  As with most tools, there is a basic
  syntax-highlighted SourceView pane.  There are also PreView
  (embedded Internet Explorer) and DTDView panes.  But the main
  view is a "tree-with-table" view.  The structure
  of the document is displayed in a collapsible tree hierarchy in
  one pane, while any attributes or element bodies are displayed in
  a table in another pane.  A third tree-with-table pane is used
  to edit long attribute values or body texts.

  {Screenshot of the EditML Pro:
     http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/EditMLPro.png}

  The tree-with-table view EditML Pro uses is useful for editing
  data-oriented documents; but it really falls apart for
  prose-oriented ones.  The problem is that inline markup is
  treated as a child element--which is technically true, but does
  not let you determine the relations between PCDATA nodes and
  child element nodes.  For example, in the screenshot, the
  <author> element contains some text, and inside that text is an
  <img> and a <a> child.  You simply cannot determine in this
  view -where- the image and anchor occur in relation to the text.

  There are a couple useful tools included in EditML Pro. You can
  automatically generate a DTD or W3C XML Schema from an XML
  document (subject to the limits of what is possible
  automatically).  You can also convert a DTD to a W3C or
  Microsoft Schema.  As with most tools, you can validate and
  perform XSLT transformations.  The XPath search facility is pretty
  good; it even adds an "XPath Query Builder" if you want to
  compose it from a dialog (I did not find any advantage in doing
  so though).  In the SourceView the search is a simple text
  search.

  A single user version of EditML Pro costs $75.


Altova XML Spy (Suite) 4.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  XML Spy is quite simply a very impressive product--or rather, a
  collection of related products.  I already liked XML Spy pretty
  well when I reviewed an earlier version in 2001, but Altova has
  added an almost embarrassing wealth of features since then.  Of
  course, as with many things, you get what you pay for--XML Spy
  is a much more expensive product than any of the other tools I
  review here (XMetal, however, is similarly priced, and has
  similar features).  For a developer who dabbles in XML
  occasionally, XML Spy is probably overkill; but for a developer
  who deals with various XML technologies on a daily basis (on a
  Windows platform), this is a wonderful tool to have installed.
  Even the various printed introductions to XML technologies are
  nicely done (but I am not quite sure which documents were
  included for reviewers, and which for "normal" users).

  By default, the XML Spy IDE opens a large number of panes,
  containing information on projects, current attributes,
  insertable elements, miscellaneous information, and squeezed
  into the middle, the actual work area.  On a 1024x768 display,
  there is not enough room to fit all these panes and still
  display a sufficiently large work area and its various tabbed
  views--a 21" monitor might accomodate all this, but I shudder
  at the thought of trying to use XML Spy on a VGA screen.
  Fortunately, all these panes can be selectively or universally
  toggled off.

  {Screenshot of the XML Spy:
     http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/XMLSpy.png}

  Within the main work area, XML Spy IDE gives you a rich
  collection of views--very nearly a superset of every other XML
  editor I have looked at.  You get a standard text view, a
  "document editor" view, a "browser" view (which is the familiar
  flawed embedded IE CSS/tree preview-only display), a "schema
  design" view, and by default an "enhanced grid" view.  The
  default is what is displayed in the screenshot; it gives you
  the ability to fold subelements, edit both bodies and
  attributes, and differentiate node types.

  The enhanced grid view will intelligently decide when subnodes
  are better displayed as a table than a tree (you can override
  the choice).  The enhanced grid is possibly not ideal for
  prose-oriented editing, but in contrast to EditML Pro, it still
  lets you easily identify and edit inline (character-level)
  markup.  For prose-oriented XML documents, you probably want to
  use the document editor view.  This view use XSLT stylesheets
  to format display in a wordprocessor-like fashion.  Optionally,
  you can embed graphic icons in the document editor view that
  indicate where tags start and stop (taking an idea from XMetal
  here).  I would have preferred use of CSS for this document
  editor view to XSLT, but if you have the whole XML Spy Suite,
  you can use the XSLT Designer to create typographic views
  without needing to manually tune XSLT.

  The utilities in XML Spy are both plentiful and well-organized.
  You can do XSLT transformations.  You can generate DTDs and
  Schemas from XML, or convert between them.  You can do searches
  based on XPaths, and display multiple matches, as with
  <oXygen/>--you can also extract the XPath of the cursor
  position.  There is also search on text in bodies, attributes,
  values, comments, etc., but no regular expressions.  In text
  view, you get an in-place popup of allowed element (also like
  <oXygen/>).  Obviously, you can easily check well-formedness
  and validity; and if you follow the insertion dialogs you can
  keep a document valid while editing.

  While the features and user interface for XML Spy are
  wonderful, the product has a few stability problems of note.
  Every once in a while (on my Win98r2 test machine, with current
  OS and IE patches installed), both the IDE and the XSLT
  Designer freeze up, and have to be manually killed (without a
  save).  I tried to install the extra Apache FOP support so that
  I could produce PDF/PS output, but had no success.  In fact,
  attempting to perform this action is one of the things that
  consistently freezes XML Spy IDE (I have a hunch the problem
  has something to do with my Java installation, which might
  justify it not -working-, but should not lock up the
  application).

  A single user version of XML Spy Suite costs US$399.  It is
  also possible to buy the XML Spy IDE by itself, without other
  components, for $199.  The other components are also available
  separately.  And there are various (rather moderate) volume
  discouts.  My hunch is that if you are considering XML Spy for
  a large site, you could negotiate something with Altova better
  than what is listed on their website.

  more than a personal one, which puts it in a price and
  capability league with XML-Spy, but a different niche than the
  other tools I look at:
