XML MATTERS #27: RELAX NG Forms
Compact Syntax and XML Syntax

    The RELAX NG compact syntax provides a much less verbose, and
    easier to read, format for describing the same semantic
    constraints as RELAX NG XML syntax. This installment looks
    at tools for working with and transforming between the two
    syntax forms.

EMPHASIZING READABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Readers of my earlier installments on RELAX NG will have noticed
  that I chose to provide many of my examples using compact syntax
  rather than XML syntax. Both formats are semantically equivalent,
  but the compact syntax is, in my opinion, far easier to read and
  write. Moreover, readers of this column in general will have a
  sense of how little enamored I am of the notion that everything
  vaguely related to XML technologies must itself use an XML
  format. XSLT is a prominent example of this XML-everywhere
  tendency, and its pitfalls--but that is a rant for a different
  column.

  In the later part of this article, I will discuss the format
  of the RELAX NG compact syntax in more detail than the prior
  installments allowed.

TOOL SUPPORT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On the down side, since the RELAX NG compact syntax is newer--and
  not 100% settled at its edges--tool support for compact syntax is
  less complete than for the XML syntax. For example, even though
  the Java tool 'trang' supports conversion between compact and XML
  syntax, the associated tool 'jing' will only validate against XML
  syntax schemas. Obviously, it is not overly difficult to generate
  the XML syntax RELAX NG schema to use for validation, but direct
  usage of the compact syntax schema would be more convenient.
  Likewise, the Python tools 'xvif' and '4xml' validate only
  against XML syntax schemas.

  To help remedy the gaps in direct support for compact syntax, I
  have produced a Python tool for parsing RELAX NG compact schemas,
  and for outputting them to XML format. While my 'rnc2rng' tool
  only does what 'trang' does, Eric van der Vlist and Uche Ogbuji
  have expressed their interest in including 'rnc2rng' in 'xvif'
  and '4xml', respectively.  Hopefully, in the near future direct
  validation against compact syntax schemas will be included in
  these tools.

  Writing 'rnc2rng' proved more difficult than I anticipated; and
  there is probably a lesson in that. While RELAX NG compact syntax
  is quite readable--as we will see below--there are enough
  variations in the arrangement of tokens between instances that a
  parser was non-trivial to write. For better or worse, I use
  [PLY]'s [lex] module to tokenize the schema, but gave up on using
  [yacc] for the parsing, using application-specific massaging of
  the token stream instead. Debugging declarative grammars is often
  more difficult than incrementally adjusting imperative code.
  Despite my frequent concern for the unfriendliness of XML, the
  task of parsing an XML syntax schema would have been far simpler,
  since I could have let a framework like SAX or DOM do most of
  the work for me.

MORE ON RELAX NG EDITORS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Since the last installment, tool support for RELAX NG has gotten
  a little bit better. The XML editor oXygen has come out with a
  version 2.0 that incorporates 'trang' as a plugin, and thereby
  some support for RELAX NG. While this is not the place for a full
  review, I found oXygen 2.0--which I liked in version 1.2 to start
  with--has gained a number of nice features and general polish. I
  would like to see RELAX NG integrated at a deeper level into
  various editors--to a degree similar to DTD and W3C XML Schema.
  With a bit more time, I think greater RELAX NG integration into
  tools is likely.

SYNTAX FEATURES - NAMESPACES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A compact syntax RELAX NG schema may begin with any of several
  optional namespace declarations. Each of these looks a lot like
  an assignment statement in a programming language. A default
  namespace for schema tags may be specified with:

      default namespace = "http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/version"

  When converted to XML syntax, use of this declaration appends a
  "ns" attribute to the root element of the schema. If this
  namespace is not explicitly specified, the "default default"
  namespace is used, and is declared with the root attribute, e.g.:

      <root-tag xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">

  You may also declare an external namespace for elements or
  attributes:

      namespace foo = "http://some.path.to/foo"

  This lets you describe elements like:

      element foo:bar { ... }

  When converted to XML syntax, the namespace URL is added to the
  root tag as an extra attribute:

      <root-tag xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"
                xmlns:foo="http://some.path.to/foo">

  The namespace "a" is a bit special here.  RELAX NG allows
  annotations, which are basically just tags with the "a"
  namespace.  In compact syntax, you can avoid thinking about
  namespaces, and add an annotation with initial double hash
  marks:

      ## An annotation

  Converted to XML syntax, this annotation appears as:

      <a:documentation>An annotation</a:documentation>

  By the way, a single leading hash introduces a comment instead
  of an annotation.  The following compact syntax form:

      # This is a comment

  Corresponds to the XML form:

      <!-- This is a comment -->

  You can also use a slightly odd compact syntax form to specify
  other annotations within the "a" namespace:

      [ a:defaultValue = "foo" ]

  A root attribute "xmlns:a" will be specified automatically in
  the XML syntax if annotations are used, but since "a" is just
  another namespace, you can specfify you own URL if you want.
  The default attribute is equivalent to specifying:

      namespace a = "http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotation/1.0"

  One more special namespace is specified differently, in both
  syntax forms.  Datatypes rely on a modular specification,
  usually using W3C XML Schema datatypes.  You may specify these
  with compact syntax:

      datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchama-datatypes"

  Or XML syntax:

      <root-tag xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"
         datatypeLibrary="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchama-datatypes">

SYNTAX FEATURES - NESTED AND CONTEXT FREE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The main body of a RELAX NG grammar may have either of two
  styles. In some way, the more direct style is to simply nest
  elements and attributes where they should occur in a valid
  instance.  Generally it is good form to use indentation much as
  you would in a programming language, but as in C-family
  languages, curly-braces are the actual block delimiters.  A
  moderately complete schema looks like, e.g.:

      #-------------- A nested compact syntax schema -----------#
      # A library patron example
      default namespace = "http://some.other.url/ns"
      namespace foo = "http://home.of.foo/ns"
      datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
      ## Annotation here
      element patron {
        element name { xsd:string { pattern = "\w{,10}" } }
        & element id-num { xsd:string }
        & element book {
            ( attribute isbn { text }
            | attribute title { text }
            | attribute anonymous { empty })
          }*
      }

  The library patron example uses most of the syntax elements.
  Interpersed "&"s between elements (or attributes) indicate that
  the several elements must occur, but may do so in any order. In
  XML syntax, this is the same as the '<interleave>' tag. Likewise,
  interpersed "|"s indicate a choice between several items--in XML,
  '<choice>'. Notice the "book" element too, the parenthesis
  indicate a group, but they are redundant in this case. A group
  (XML: '<group>'), however, is useful as part of quantification or
  interpersal, e.g.:

      #------------ Using groups for quanitfication ------------#
      element foo {
          ( element bar { text },
            element baz { text } )+,
          element bam { text } }

  In this case, a valid document's root '<foo>' element might have
  contain several '<bar></bar><baz></baz>' sequences prior to one
  final '<bam>' element. There is no way to express the same
  concept by only quantifying the indifidual "bar" and "baz"
  elements.

  A nested-style RELAX NG grammar need not describe a single
  element only. Any well-formed XML document must have a single
  root element, so clearly an attribute at the top is prohibited.
  Likewise a sequence or interleave description at the top level
  could not describe a well-formed XML document, and therefore it
  could not describe a valid one.  But there is nothing wrong
  with allowing a -choice- of root elements, e.g.:

      #-------------- Choice as top level grammar --------------#
      ( element foo {text}
      | element bar {text} )

  A second style of RELAX NG grammar more closely resembles a DTD.
  A special "production" named "start" is indicated at the
  beginning, followed by a variety of other named productions. As
  with namespace declarations, a production is named in the manner
  of an assignment in a programming language. For example, a
  library patron schema could also look something like:

      #-------- A context free compact syntax schema -----------#
      # A library patron example
      default namespace = "http://some.other.url/ns"
      namespace foo = "http://home.of.foo/ns"
      datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
      ## Annotation here
      start = patron
      patron = name & id-num & book
      name = element name { xsd:string { pattern = "\w{,10}" } }
      id-num = element id-num { xsd:string }
      book = element book {
            ( attribute isbn { text }
            | attribute title { text }
            | attribute anonymous { empty }) }*

  Names of productions may occur within other productions, which
  can avoid repititions, and generally make complex patterns more
  readable. Beyond readability, naming patterns allows recursive
  definition of patterns--either direct or mutual recursion. For
  example, describing HTML--where tables can nest within tables, or
  lists within lists--is not possible in a strictly nested style.
  An upshot of recursive XML instance documents is to make DTDs
  and context free RELAX NG much more natural as descriptions
  than is W3C XML Schemas (but you -can- get what is needed out
  of W3C XML Schemas, just with more work).

  It is probably worth looking at an entire XML syntax RELAX NG
  schema document.  For comparison, the below is what 'rnc2rng'
  produces when processing the above context free library patron
  schema:

      #----------- A context free XML syntax schema ------------#
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <!-- A library patron example -->
      <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng/ns/structure/1.0"
          ns="http://some.other.url/ns"
          datatypeLibrary="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
          xmlns:a="http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0"
          xmlns:foo="http://home.of.foo/ns">
        <a:documentation>Annotation here</a:documentation>
        <start><ref name="patron"/></start>
        <define name="patron">
          <interleave>
            <ref name="name"/>
            <ref name="id-num"/>
            <ref name="book"/>
          </interleave>
        </define>
        <define name="name">
          <element name="name">
            <data type="string"/>
              <param name="pattern">\w{,10}</param>
            </data>
          </element>
        </define>
        <define name="id-num">
          <element name="id-num">
            <data type="string"/>
          </element>
        </define>
        <define name="book">
          <zeroOrMore>
            <element name="book">
              <choice>
                <attribute name="isbn"/>
                <attribute name="title"/>
                <attribute name="anonymous">
                  <empty/>
                </attribute>
              </choice>
            </element>
          </zeroOrMore>
        </define>
      </grammar>

  I would say this is easier to read than a W3C XML Schema, but
  it sure does not come close to the compact syntax (prior
  installments pointed out that this schema is actually
  -impossible- to express precisely in W3C XML Schema, or DTDs).

MISCELLANY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In some of these examples you will have noticed that elements
  and attributes, in compact syntax, always contain -something-
  in curly braces after their name.  In XML syntax, you can
  self-close an attribute tag, but to prevent ambiguity, you need
  to specify at least '{text}' or '{empty}' for an attribute
  body.  You can also use a more complex datatype description if
  you wish, of course.  Also, the only quantification that makes
  sense for attributes is "?"--attributes might be optional, but
  they will not be repeated multiple times.

  In some corner cases, 'rnc2rng' differs from 'trang'.  For
  example, both tools force an annotation to occur inside a root
  element in XML syntax, even if the annotation line occurs
  before the root element in the compact syntax.  Since
  well-formed XML documents are single rooted, this is a
  necessity.  But 'trang' also moves comments in a similar
  manner, while 'rnc2rng' does not.  At minimum, some slightly
  different use is made of whitespace between the tools.  Most
  likely, a few other variations exist, but hopefully none that
  are semantically important.

RESOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The [xvif] library itself can be downloaded from:

    http://downloads.xmlschemata.org/python/

  However, [4Suite] is a somewhat more polished tool that
  incorporates [xvif] for RELAX NG validation.  The command-line
  tool '4xml' will validate against both RELAX NG and DTDs, with
  various options.  [4Suite] includes many other tools and
  libraries for working with many XML-related technologies:

    http://4suite.org/?xslt=downloads.xslt

  The tools [trang] and [jing] are complementary tools for
  transformation between schemata and validation against RELAX NG
  schemas.  The former depends on the latter, but both can be
  downloaded in a convenient archive from:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html

  You will need to optain an implementation of the Java API for
  XML Processing (JAXP) to use [trang].  If you run a Java 1.4
  JVM, you are fine already; otherwise, obtain [crimson] at:

    http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson/

  [DTDinst] is a Java tool to convert DTDs into an XML instance
  document format, including handling of parametric entities:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/dtdinst/

  The [DTDinst] XML format is of limited utility by itself, since
  nothing else works with it.  However, an XSLT stylesheet is
  available to transform this format into RELAX NG (with a few
  caveats).  You will need an XSLT tool to utilize this:
