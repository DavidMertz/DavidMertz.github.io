    Since the "golden age" of Python 1.5.2--for a long time a stable and
    solid version--Python has greatly increased its number of syntactic
    features and built-in functions and types.  One area where features
    have accumulated to a very large degree is in ways to access methods
    by using attribute syntax.  A huge variety of "behind the scenes"
    techniques, each with pluses and minuses, have grown within the
    latest Python versions.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  In this article, David discusses the non-obvious features and
  misfeatures that have been added to the last several Python versions;
  and weighs in on which are truly valuable, and which unnecessary
  complication. David hopes to provide a collection of valuable things
  to watch out for to all those programmers who use Python less than
  full time--either programmer in other languages, or people like
  scientists for whom programming is only a side task.  Where some
  quandries are raised, solutions are suggested.
</p>
<h3>Attributes And Methods</h3>
 <p>
  In most object-oriented languages, methods and attributes are
  almost-but-not-quite the same thing. Both things can be attached to a
  class and/or to an instance. Whatever the details of implementation
  though, there seems to be a difference too. Methods are things
  attached to an object that you can <em>call</em> to initiate actions and
  calculations; attributes simply have values that can be
  retrieved (and perhaps modified).
</p>
<p>
  There are langauges--like Java--where what I have described is pretty
  much the end of the story. Attributes are attributes, and methods are
  methods. Java, by convention, puts a heavy emphasis on encapsulation
  and data hiding; the result is an encouragement of the use of
  "setters" and "getters" to access otherwise private attribute data. To
  the Java way of thinking, using explicit method calls covers in
  advance the case where you might want to add computation or
  side-effects to data access or modification. Of course, the result of
  the Java attitude is verboseness, and the imposition of a sometimes
  artificial seeming discipline: you wind up writing <code>foo.getBar()</code>
  instead of <code>foo.bar</code>, and <code>foo.setBar(value)</code> instead of
  <code>foo.bar=value</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Ruby is worth mentioning as a somewhat odd creature. It actually
  insists on data hiding to an even greater degree than Java does: <em>all</em>
  attributes are <em>always</em> "private", you can <em>never</em> directly access
  instance data. At the same time, Ruby uses some syntax conventions
  that make method calls look like attribute access does in other
  languages.  The first element of this is Ruby's option parentheses in
  method calls; the second part is its use of semi-special naming of
  methods with symbols that are operators in most languages.  So in
  Ruby, <code>foo.bar</code> is just a shorter option for calling <code>foo.bar()</code>; and
  "setting" <code>foo.bar=value</code> is shorthand for <code>foo.bar=(value)</code>.  Behind
  the scenes, <em>everything</em> goes through a method call.
</p>
<p>
  Python is much more flexible than either Java or Ruby, but that fact
  is as much a criticism as it is praise. If you access <code>foo.bar</code>, or
  set <code>foo.bar=value</code> in Python, you might be using a simple data value,
  or you might be calling some semi-hidden code. Moreover, in the latter
  case, there are at least a half-dozen different ways you might reach
  that block of code, each one having slightly different behavior than
  the others, with dizzying subtleties and nuances.  This deluge of
  options harms the regularity of Python, and makes it harder to
  understand for non-experts (or even for experts).  I know why things
  have gotten where they are: new capabilities have been added to
  Python's object-oriented underpinnings in several steps.  But I am not
  terribly pleased by the chaos.
</p>
<h3>The old fashion way
</h3>
 <p>
  Since the old days (before Python 2.1), Python has had a magic method
  called <code>.__getattr__()</code> that class could define to return computed
  values rather than simple data accesses. Correspondingly, the magic
  methods <code>.__setattr__()</code> and <code>.__delattr__()</code> could cause code to run
  with "attributes" were set or deleted. The problem with this old
  system was that you never really knew whether or not the code would
  actually be called, since it depended on whether an attribute with the
  same name as the one accessed existed in <code>obj.__dict__</code>. You could try
  to create <code>.__setattr__()</code> and <code>.__delattr__()</code> methods that
  controlled what wound up there, but even that did not prevent direct
  manipulation of <code>obj.__dict__</code> by other code. Both changed inheritance
  trees and passing objects to external functions could often make it
  non-obvious whether a method would or would not actually run when
  working with an object.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     def __getattr__(self, name):
...         return "Value of %s" % name
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.just_this = "Some value"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.just_this
'Some value'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.something_else
'Value of something_else'

</pre></div><p>
  Accessing <code>foo.just_this</code> skips the method code, while accessing
  <code>foo.something_else</code> runs it; other than the fact this shell session
  is short, nothing makes the difference obvious.  In fact, asking the
  obvious <code>hasattr()</code> question give you a misleading answer:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(foo,'never_mentioned')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.__dict__.has_key('never_mentioned')  # this works
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.__dict__.has_key('just_this')
True

</pre></div><h3>The slots hack
</h3>
 <p>
  With Python 2.2, we gained a new mechanism for creating "restricted"
  classes. Exactly what the new-style class <code><cite>_slots_</cite></code> attribute is
  supposed to be used for is nowhere made unambiguous. For the most
  part, the Python documentation advices to use <code>.__slots__</code> only for
  performance optimization in classes that might have a very large
  number of instances--but specifically <em>not</em> as a way to declare
  attributes. Nonetheless, the latter <em>is</em> what slots do: they create a
  class without a <code>.__dict__</code> attribute that only has the attributes
  explicitly named (methods, however, are still declared as normal
  within the class body). It is peculiar, but this gives you a way to
  ensure that method code is called on attribute access:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo2(object):
...     __slots__ = ('just_this')
...     def __getattr__(self, name):
...         return "Value of %s" % name
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2 = Foo2()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.just_this = "I'm slotted"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.just_this
"I'm slotted"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.something_else = "I'm not slotted"
AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'something_else'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.something_else
'Value of something_else'

</pre></div><p>
  The declaration of <code>.__slots__</code> guarantees that only those attributes
  you specify can be accessed directly, everything else will go through
  the <code>.__getattr__()</code> call.  If you have also created a
  <code>.__setattr__()</code> method, you can make an assignment do something other
  than raise an <code>AttributeError</code> (but be sure to let the "slotted" value
  pass through on assignment).  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo3(object):
...     __slots__ = ('x')
...     def __setattr__(self, name, val):
...         if name in Foo.__slots__:
...             object.__setattr__(self, name, val)
...     def __getattr__(self, name):
...         return "Value of %s" % name
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3 = Foo3()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.x
'Value of x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.x = 'x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.x
'x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.y
'Value of y'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.y = 'y'   # Doesn't do anything, but doesn't raise exception
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo3.y
'Value of y'

</pre></div><h3>The <code>.__getattribute__()</code> method
</h3>
 <p>
  In Python 2.2 and later, you have the option of using the method
  <code>.__getattribute__()</code> instead of the confusingly similarly named
  old-style <code>.__getattr__()</code>.  Well, you have the option if you use
  new-style classes (which generally you should anyway).  The
  <code>.__getattribute__()</code> method is more powerful than its sibling in that
  it intercepts <em>all</em> attribute access, whether or not an attribute
  is defined in <code>obj.__dict__</code> or <code>obj.__slots__</code>.  A drawback of using
  <code>.__getattribute__()</code> is that since all access goes though the method.
  If you use this method, a bit of special programming is needed if you
  want to return (or manipulate) the "real" value of the attribute:
  usually you do this by calling <code>.__getattribute__()</code> on the superclass
  (usually <code>object</code>).  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo4(object):
...     def __getattribute__(self, name):
...         try:
...             return object.__getattribute__(self, name)
...         except:
...             return "Value of %s" % name
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo4 = Foo4()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo4.x = 'x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo4.x
'x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo4.y
'Value of y'

</pre></div><p>
  In all versions of Python, <code>.__setattr__()</code> and <code>.__delattr__()</code> also
  intercept all the write and delete access to attributes, rather than
  merely those absent from <code>obj.__dict__</code>.
</p>
<h3>Descriptors
</h3>
 <p>
  We are moving along nicely in an enumeration of ways to make
  attributes act like methods.  Within these magic methods, you can
  examine the specific attribute name being accessed, assigned, or
  deleted.  In fact, if you like, you can check names by regular
  expression or by other computation.  In principle you can make all
  sorts of runtime decisions about how to handle use of some given
  pseudo-attribute--for example, perhaps you do not simply want to
  compare the attribute name to a string pattern, but actually look up
  whether the name is an attribute that has been stored in a persistent
  database.
</p>
<p>
  Much of the time, however, you would just like for a few "attributes"
  to act in a special manner, but let other attributes operate as plain
  attributes.  The plain attributes should neither trigger any special
  code, nor suffer the time penalty of working through method code.  In
  these cases you can use <em>descriptors</em> for attributes.  Or closely
  related to descriptors, you can define <em>properties</em>.  Behind the
  scenes, properties and descriptors amount to the same thing, but the
  syntax of defining them is rather different; with the difference
  in definition styles, you get advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
  Let us first look at a descriptor. The idea here is to assign an
  instance of a special kind of class to an attribute within another
  class. This special "descriptor" class is a new-style class that
  contains methods called <code>.__get__()</code>, <code>.__set__()</code> and <code>__delete__()</code>,
  or at least a subset of those. If the descriptor class implements at
  least the first two, it is called a "data descriptor"; if it
  implements only the first, it is called a "non-data descriptor".
</p>
<p>
  The latter (non-data descriptor) is likely to be used to return a
  callable object. A non-data descriptor is, in a sense, often a fancy
  name for a method--but the particular method returned by descriptor
  access could be determined at runtime. This starts to get us into the
  scary realm of things similar to metaclasses and decorators, that I
  have written about before in this column.  Of course, a regular method
  can also decide what code to run based on runtime conditions, so there
  is nothing fundamentally new about this concept of runtime
  determination of what a "method" does.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, a data descriptor is more general, so let us look at one.
  Such a descriptor <em>could</em> return something callable--any Python
  function or method can return anything, after all.  But our example
  just deals with simple values (and side effects).  We want to make any
  use of a few attributes log the action to STDERR:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class ErrWriter(object):
...     def __get__(self, obj, type=None):
...         print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, "get", self, obj, type
...         return self.data
...     def __set__(self, obj, value):
...         print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, "set", self, obj, value
...         self.data = value
...     def __delete__(self, obj):
...         print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, "delete", self, obj
...         del self.data
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     this = ErrWriter()
...     that = ErrWriter()
...     other = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.this = 5
set &lt;__main__.ErrWriter object at 0x5cec90&gt;
    &lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x5cebf0&gt; 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print foo.this
get &lt;__main__.ErrWriter object at 0x5cec90&gt;
    &lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x5cebf0&gt; &lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt;
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print foo.other
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.other = 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; print foo.other
6

</pre></div><p>
  The class <code>Foo</code> defines <code>this</code> and <code>that</code> as descriptors of the
  <code>ErrWriter</code> class. The attribute <code>other</code> is just a plain class
  attribute. Actually, there is a caveat here. On first access to
  <code>foo.other</code>, we read the class attribute; after we assign a value, we
  actually read the instance attribute instead. The class attribute is
  still there, just hidden, i.e.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.other
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__class__.other
4

</pre></div><p>
  In contrast, the descriptor stays a class-level object, even though
  you can access it through the instance.  This has the usually
  undesirable effect of making the descriptor something like a
  singleton.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2 = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo2.this
get &lt;__main__.ErrWriter object at 0x5cec90&gt;
    &lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x5cebf0&gt; &lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt;
5

</pre></div><p>
  To simulate a usual "per instance" behavior, you would need to make
  use of the <code>obj</code> passed into <code>ErrWriter</code> magic methods.  This <code>obj</code> is
  the instance that has the descriptor.  So you might define a
  non-singleton descriptor like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>class ErrWriter(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.inst = {}
    def __get__(self, obj, type=None):
        return self.inst[obj]
    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        self.inst[obj] = value
    def __delete__(self, obj):
        del self.inst[obj]

</pre></div><h3>Properties
</h3>
 <p>
  Properties work like descriptors, but are generally defined inside a
  particular class rather than being created as "utility descriptors"
  that various classes might utilize.   As with "regular" descriptors,
  the idea is to define "getters", "setters" and "deleters".  After
  that, you use the special function <code>property()</code> to turn those methods
  into a descriptor.  For the hyper-technical readers (those whose
  brains are still more-or-less operational): <code>property</code> is not really a
  function, but a type--don't worry about it.
</p>
<p>
  Oddly, properties bring us full circle to the brief description I gave
  at top about how the Ruby programming languge works.  A property is
  just a thing that looks like an attribute syntactically (as used), but
  is defined by defining all the getters, setters, and so on.  If you
  wanted to, you could impose complete "Ruby-discipline" in Python, and
  never access "real" attributes.  More likely you will want to
  mix-and-match though.  Let us see how a property works:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>class FooP(object):
    def getX(self): return self.__x
    def setX(self, value): self.__x = value
    def delX(self): del self.__x
    x = property(getX, setX, delX, "I'm the 'x' property.")

</pre></div><p>
  The names of the getter, setter, and deleter are nothing reserved.
  Usually you will want to use sensible names like the above. What they
  actually do can be anything, but often it is reasonable to use
  double-underscore versions of names for the attributes. These
  attributes get attached to the instance, just with the usual Python
  name mangling for "semi-hidden" attributes.  Moreover, the methods
  remain perfectly usable too:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foop = FooP()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foop.x = 'FooP x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foop.getX()
'FooP x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foop._FooP__x
'FooP x'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foop.x
'FooP x'

</pre></div><h3>Let Confusion Reign</h3>
 <p>
  We have seen, in this installment, far too many ways to make Python
  instance attributes act like (or be) method calls. Unlike in some of
  these installments, I really do not have any clear advice for readers
  on how to cut through the complexity. I would like to be able to tell
  you to simply choose one of the described techniques, and ignore the
  others as inferior or less general.  Unfortunately, each technique
  described has strengths, and has weaknesses.  Each is pretty
  reasonable for certain programming contexts, even though the syntax
  and semantics of each is so radically different from the others.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, while I have not described it in this article, I have
  thought (vaguely) of a number of other even more obscure ways that a
  programmer might use metaclasses, class factories, and decorators to
  obtain similar effects to the "standard" half-dozen techniques I have
  outlined.  Those ideas would truly probe into some dark corners of
  Python metaprogramming.
</p>
<p>
  What would be nice would be if all the things I described were
  possible, but the variations among them were simply parameterized in
  some straightforward way rather than using wholly different syntax and
  organization. The grand goal of Python 3000 is a simplification along
  these lines; but I have not seen any concrete proposals on how such
  unification and simplification of attributes-as-methods might work.
  One idea that occurs to me is that Python might enable decorators for
  classes (along with the current use in methods and functions), and
  also provide some standard module of decorators for the most common
  "magic attribute" behaviors. This is speculation, and I do not know
  exactly how it might work, but I can just imagine such a thing could
  hide the complexity from the 95% of Python programmers who really do
  not wish to worry too much about Python internals and cryptic mojo.
