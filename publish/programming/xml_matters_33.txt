XML MATTERS #33: XML for Word Processors
Open source embraces XML as native document format

    In their recent versions, the three major Free Software word
    processing programs have all adopted XML formats as their native
    document format. The approach to XML taken by AbiWord, KOffice's
    KWord, and OpenOffice.org Writer differs somewhat between the
    applications-- largely reflecting the underlying development focus
    of each project. But all open source word processor developers have
    realized the advantages of XML as a document format:
    componentization of parsers and writers; openness and formality of
    format specification; applicability of XSLT and other transformation
    APIs.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Beyond some abandoned or incomplete efforts, three word processors are
  available now in actively maintained states.  All do an excellent job
  as word processors; all provide a variety of useful import/export
  capabilities--include with the widely used, but proprietary, MS-Word
  format; and all are available in both source and binary form for Linux
  along with other platforms (on both Free and proprietary OSs).  And
  most interstingly for this column, AbiWord, KWord, and OpenOffice.org
  Writer all use XML for their native document formats.

  For this column, I am not interested in comparing the features,
  appearance, and user interfaces of the three abovementioned projects.
  Suffice it to say that all of them have obtained a very nice degree of
  polish in look-and-feel, and all have a sufficient feature set for
  creations of most types of business and personal documents. What I am
  interested in here is the design of XML document formats--the guts
  inside these projects. An additional Free Software application is
  worth mentioning in passing here: LyX is a GUI front-end to creation
  of LaTeX documents. For specialized technical documents--such as those
  involving many equations or complex cross-referencing--LyX is a good
  choice, but its learning curve is steep for creating general business
  correspondences.

  A few words on the three projects are worthwhile for those unfamiliar
  with them. AbiWord is a standalone word processor with an emphasis on
  cross-platform compatibility, moderate size, and good execution speed.
  OpenOffice.org is an outgrowth of Sun Microsystems' StarOffice
  product, which was released under Free Software license, and taken up
  by a developer community. OpenOffice.org Writer is just part of a
  suite of inter-operable applications including a spreadsheet, vector
  drawing program, presentation application, and some other components.
  Similarly, KWord is part of KOffice (which is itself part of the
  overall KDE project); KOffice contains even more components than does
  OpenOffice.org--adding flowcharting, raster image editing, charting,
  and other applications. In any case, for now we focus only on the word
  processor component of KOffice and OpenOffice.org.

TESTING DOCUMENT FORMATS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As you would expect, new versions of these open source word processors
  usually tweak the document format a bit. Fortunately, XML is well
  suited to upward changes, which usually can amount to addition of
  (optional) new attributes and child elements. If done well, earliers
  versions of applications can even degrade relatively gracefully when
  they read newer saved documents--usually just by ignoring unfamiliar
  tags and attributes.

  In the XML formats I looked at, DTDs are provided by the project
  developers, but they tend to be somewhat out of sync with the actual
  XML documents created by the same version of the applications.
  Well-formedness is still respected--as you would hope, but creation
  and parsing seem to be rather informal matters, the final say is the
  source code that implements the formats, not a DTD or Schema. In other
  words, the samples below will -not- validate successfully. To get a
  look at what documents -really- look like, I created a very simple
  test document, shown in screenshot:

  {Screenshot of simple document:
   http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/simple_doc.gif}

  Interestingly--if perhaps not surprisingly--we will see in the XML
  versions of this document that the representation on the identical
  document is not unique.  Of course, being XML, issues like whitespace
  normalization allow non-identical files to represent the same infoset;
  but that is not what I mean.  I found that, at least in some details,
  the exact same formatting can get different markup due to the sequence
  of user actions that went into the document creation (and perhaps due
  to other factors too).  While this fact is not necessarily a
  problem--and probably applies equally to binary document formats like
  MS-Word's .doc format--it seems mildly unfortunate that
  cannonicalization is not as straightforward at a semantic level as it
  is at the XML syntax.

STARTING SIMPLE: [AbiWord]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  AbiWord uses a relatively simple and straightforward XML document
  format in which appearance and layout are specified in CSS-like
  attributes.  While many such attributes are directly taken from CSS,
  the AbiWord developers decided that CSS was insufficient for their
  needs, so took it only as a starting point.

  Although they are a bit long, I would like to present the entire XML
  source of the word processor documents created. I have prettified
  these sources, but have verified that my infoset neutral changes do
  not affect re-import. First the AbiWord version:

  A few features stand out. One notable advantage that comes with XML is
  the use of namespaces to indicate external Schemas developed and
  refined by other groups. For example, inclusion of equations or
  figures can be done using MathML or SVG, respectively; the AbiWord
  developers have no need to re-engineer these capabilities themselves.

  Another thing to notice about AbiWord's format is that it only
  half-heartedly uses XML attributes in describing the rendering of
  sections or character spans.  That is, where some XML formats try to
  list -a priori- all the possible formatting in attributes or child
  tags (named in the DTD), AbiWord simply throws in a generic 'props'
  attribute that contains CSS-style formatting.  This pushes the
  rendering semantics outside of the XML infoset (for better or worse I
  am not sure).

BECOMING FORMAL: OASIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The XML format developed by Sun Microsystems for StarOffice (and taken
  up by OpenOffice.org), has been assumed by an OASIS Technical
  Committee (see Resources)--in short, it is on its way to becoming a
  standard, not simply a format. Moreover, the KOffice project, which
  previously used its own XML format, has recently decided to move
  towards native use of the OpenOffice.org format--or some future OASIS
  enhancement to that format. I find it more useful, therefore, to
  present the OASIS/OpenOffice.org format than to detail the older
  KOffice format. That said, current stable versions of KOffice have not
  yet switched formats as of this writing.

  In contrast to the AbiWord format, OpenOffice.org's XML format
  encompasses all the type of documents supported by OpenOffice.org
  applications--i.e. not simply word processor documents, but also
  charts, drawings, and so on.  Data of different types is indicated by
  namespaces for each type, allowing multiple data formats to be
  embedded in the same document.  How and whether a particular
  application handles a given data type is up to the application; but,
  for example, one application might pass control for rendering a given
  data type to another component (either in the same suite, or a wholly
  external application).

  For now we are interested just in the simple word processor document
  presented above. Let us take a look at it--as with the AbiWord
  version, I have prettified the XML, but maintained the infoset. Also
  as with AbiWord's version, the document does not actually validate; in
  this case the 'dr3d', 'form' and 'math' namespace attributes are
  missing from the version of the DTD included with my OpenOffice.org
  installation (the same one that created this document)..  Also, while
  the below is the content of interest, the complete OpenOffice.org data
  file is a zip archive containing several ancillary XML documents for
  settings, metadata, and styles (normally having the extension '.sxw'):

            text:style-name="T3">italics</text:span><text:span

          <text:p text:style-name="P1">New paragraph with <text:span
            text:style-name="T5">underline</text:span>.</text:p>
        </office:body>
      </office:document-content>

  The OpenOffice.org format follows a generally similar structure to
  that of AbiWord.  Instead of AbiWord's '<p>' tag, OpenOffice.org uses
  '<text:p>'; and instead of AbiWord's '<c>', OpenOffice.org uses
  '<text:span>'.  A notable difference here is that where AbiWord uses
  formatting descriptions directly accompanying marked character
  sequences, OpenOffice.org always uses indirect references to named
  styles, even where the names of "automatic styles" are generated on
  the fly by the generating application.

  Our sample document also illustrates a point made above about
  incidental variations in document infosets.  For example, notice that
  the period at the end of the first paragraph is marked as style "T4",
  while the period in the final paragraph is outside any span.
  Moreover, looking at the "T4" style definition earlier we see that it
  merely defines "normal"--i.e. default--font style and weight.  In
  other words, there is no actual reason to mark text with the "T4"
  style as opposed to leave it as PCDATA of the surrounding paragraph.

PROCESSING AN XML DOCUMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  One important advantage of using XML formats like those in the word
  processors we have looked at is the facilitation of access by new
  tools to those documents.  It is just easier to write new applications
  that process XML word processor documents than it is to write ones
  that work with binary formats, especially with proprietary ones.  To
  some extent, RTF (rich text format) achieves a similar goal: RTF is an
  textual markup format that is publicly documented.  But as things have
  unfolded, there are many more commodity XML parsers to choose from
  than there are RTF parsers.

  One application that obviously comes to mind for working with an XML
  word processor format is a new word processing application.  The
  hoped-for transparent interoperability between KOffice (KWord) and
  OpenOffice.org (Writer) is an example of this.  But somewhat more
  modest applications are worth keeping in mind to: indexing, analyzing,
  summarizing, comparing, or otherwise batch processing documents are
  also tasks that are frequently useful.

  For many of these batch-style applications, XSLT stands out as an
  obvious processing language--and indeed, existing conversion routines
  often use XSLT. However, I am much less fond of XSLT than are its
  proponents. Despite the declarative goal of the language, I usually
  find its details confusing and difficult to maintain and debug.  In
  any case, what I present below is a very simple utility that utilizes
  the [gnosis.xml.objectify] Python XML binding that I have discussed in
  several previous installments of this column.  The utility I present
  is similar to the '-dump' option in 'lynx', only it
  processes OpenOffice.org Writer documents rather than HTML documents.
  My utility is crude, but is also extremely concise, thereby
  demonstrating some XML benefits:

      #------------------------ dumpOO.py -----------------------------#
      #!/usr/bin/env python
      import sys, zipfile
      from gnosis.xml.objectify import XML_Objectify, EXPAT, \
                                       children, tagname, content
      XML_Objectify.expat_kwargs['nspace_sep'] = None
      doc_content = zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).read('content.xml')
      doc = XML_Objectify(doc_content).make_instance()
      write = sys.stdout.write
      for o in children(doc.office_body):
          if tagname(o)=="text_p":
              for s in content(o):
                  if type(s) is unicode and s.strip():
                      write(" "+s.encode('utf-8').strip())
                  elif tagname(s)=='text_span':
                      write(" "+s.PCDATA.encode('utf-8'))
              write('\n')

  As well as not necessarily handling every OpenOffice.org construct
  gracefully (but I think it handles all text content), line wrapping is
  not peformed for paragraphs.  You could easily add this capability,
  either by using the Python 2.3+ module [textwrap], or by piping to the
  external utility 'fmt', e.g.:

      #-------------------- dumpOO.py in action -----------------------#
      $ ./dumpOO.py simple.sxw | fmt
       Minimal document with bold and italics .
      -
       New paragraph with underline .

CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Free Software and XML document formats are a natural pairing.  The
  inherent readability of XML just makes interchange and format
  specification easier, and the wide availability of XML libraries makes
  creation of new tools simple.  Moreover, from a biographical
  perspective, looking at these word processor formats really helped me
  in seeing the modularity benefits of namespaces--done right,
  namespaces can leverage the work done by many groups of independent
  developers.

  However, XML itself only goes so far.  For example, Microsoft is also
  moving towards an XML format for future versions of MS-Word; but in
  contrast to the openness of the OASIS/OpenOffice.org or AbiWord
  formats, Microsoft is surrounding its format with patent applications
  and a veil of secrecy around the format variations (plus the simple
  fact it uses cryptic tag and attribute names rather than
  self-documenting ones).  XML by itself does not really mean
  "open"--but fortunately, the developers of KOffice, AbiWord, and
  OpenOffice.org have done a generally wonderful job of obtaining
  openness with XML (albeit, the wild world of community development
  still leaves occasional impedence mismatches in, e.g. DTDs).
