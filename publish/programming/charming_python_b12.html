<h1>Charming Python #b12: Multiple Dispatch</h1>

    Object oriented programming gains much of its versatility
    through polymorphism. Objects of different kinds can behave
    in similar ways, given the right contexts. But most OOP
    programming is <em>single dispatch</em>; that is, just one
    designated object determines which code path is taken.
    Conceptually, a more general technique is to allow <em>all</em> the
    arguments to a function/method to determine its
    specialization. This article presents an implementation of
    <em>multiple dispatch</em> in Python, and shows examples where this
    makes for better programs.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Polymorphism, Really?</h3>
 <p>
  Most programmers--in Python or other object oriented
  programming languages--who utilize polymorphism, do so in a
  rather practical and concrete way.  Perhaps the most common
  application of polymorphism is in creating a family of object
  that follow a common protocol.  In Python, this is usually
  simply a matter of <em>ad hoc</em> polymorphism; in other languages,
  formal interfaces are more often declared and/or these families
  share a common ancestor.
</p>
<p>
  For example, there are many functions that operate on "file-like"
  objects, where file-like is defined simply by supporting a few
  methods: <code>.read()</code>, <code>.readlines()</code>, and maybe <code>.seek()</code>.  A
  function like <code>read_app_data()</code> might take an argument
  <code>src</code>--when we call the function, we might decide to pass it a
  local file, a <em><code>urllib</code></em> object, a <em><code>cStringIO</code></em> object, or some
  custom object that lets the function call <code>src.read()</code>.  Each
  object type is interchangeable from the point of view of how it
  functions within <code>read_app_data()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Let us step back a bit to think about what is really happening
  here. At heart, what we are concerned about is choosing the right
  code path to execute within a context; old-fashioned procedural
  code can make equivalent decisions, OOP merely adds some
  elegance. For example, a fragment of procedural (pseudo-)code
  might look like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Procedural choice of code paths on object type</h4><pre>
...bind 'src' in some manner...
if &lt;&lt;src is a file object&gt;&gt;:
    read_from_file(src)
elif &lt;&lt;src is a urllib object&gt;&gt;:
    read_from_url(src)
elif &lt;&lt;src is a stringio object&gt;&gt;:
    read_from_stringio(src)
...etc...

</pre></div><p>
  By arranging for objects of different types to implement common
  methods, we move the <em>dispatch</em> decision into the objects, and
  out of an explict conditional block.  A given <code>src</code> object
  knows what block of code it needs to call by looking through
  its inheritance tree.  There is still an implicit switch going
  on, but it is on the type of the object <code>src</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The object <code>src</code> is privileged over any arguments passed to its
  methods.  OOP syntax makes this privileging seem inevitable,
  but it is not really.  Procedural switching is simply pushed
  into the method bodies of classes in many cases.  For example
  we might implement protocol-compatible classes <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code>
  as follows (in pseudo-Python):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Foo and Bar implement the '.meth()' method</h4><pre>
class Foo:
    def meth(self, arg):
        if &lt;&lt;arg is a Foo&gt;&gt;:
            ...FooFoo code block...
        elif &lt;&lt;arg is a Bar&gt;&gt;:
            ...FooBar code block...
class Bar:
    def meth(self, arg):
        if &lt;&lt;arg is a Foo&gt;&gt;:
            ...BarFoo code block...
        elif &lt;&lt;arg is a Bar&gt;&gt;:
            ...BarBar code block...
# Function to utilize Foo/Bar single-dispatch polymorphism
def x_with_y(x, y):
    if &lt;&lt;x is Foo or Bar&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;y is Foo or Bar&gt;&gt;:
        x.meth(y)
    else:
        raise TypeError,"x, y must be either Foo's or Bar's"

</pre></div><p>
  There are five distinct code paths/blocks that might get
  executed when <code>x_with_y()</code> is called.  If the types of <code>x</code> and
  <code>y</code> are not suitable, an exception is raised (you could also do
  somethig different, of course).  But assuming the types are OK,
  the code path is chosen <em>first</em> by a polymorphic dispatch, and
  <em>second</em> by procedural switch.  Moreover, the switches within
  the definitions of <code>Foo.meth()</code> and <code>Bar.meth()</code> are largely
  equivalent.  Polymorphism--of the single-dispatch
  variety--only goes half way.
</p>
<h3>Completing Polymorphism</h3>
 <p>
  In single-dispatch polymorphism, the object that "owns" a
  method is singled out.  Syntactically, it is singled out in
  Python by being named before the dot--everything following the
  dot, method name, and left parenthesis is just an argument.
  But semantically, the object is also special in utilizing an
  inheritence tree for method resolution.
</p>
<p>
  What if we did not treat just one object in a special fashion,
  but allowed every object involved in a code block to help
  choose the correct code path?  For example, we might express
  our five-way switch in a more symmetric fashion:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Multiple dispatch on Foo and Bar</h4><pre>
x_with_y = Dispatch([((object, object), &lt;&lt;exception block&gt;&gt;)])
x_with_y.add_rule((Foo,Foo), &lt;&lt;FooFoo block&gt;&gt;)
x_with_y.add_rule((Foo,Bar), &lt;&lt;FooBar block&gt;&gt;)
x_with_y.add_rule((Bar,Foo), &lt;&lt;BarFoo block&gt;&gt;)
x_with_y.add_rule((Bar,Bar), &lt;&lt;BarBar block&gt;&gt;)
#...call the function x_with_y() using some arguments...
x_with_y(something, otherthing)

</pre></div><p>
  I think this symmetry in polymorphic dispatch on multiple
  arguments is much more elegant than is the prior style.
  As well, the style helps document the equal role of the two
  objects involved in determining the appropriate code path to
  take.
</p>
<p>
  Standard Python does not let you configure this type of
  multiple dispatch; but fortunately, you can do so using the
  module <em><code>multimethods</code></em> that I have written.  See Resources to
  download the module by itself, or as part of Gnosis Utilities.
  All you need to do once you have installed <em><code>multimethods</code></em> is
  include the following line at the top of your application:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>from multimethods import Dispatch

</pre></div><p>
  "Multimethods" is generally a synonym for multiple dispatch; but
  the name multimethod suggests the concrete function/object
  handling the more abstract concept of multiple dispatch.
</p>
<p>
  An instance of <code>Dispatch</code> is a callable object, and can be
  configured with as many rules as you wish. The method
  <code>Dispatch.remove_rule()</code> can be used to delete rules as well,
  which makes multiple dispatch using <em><code>multimethods</code></em> a bit more
  dynamic than is a static class hierarchy (but you can also do
  some arcane things with Python classes at runtime). Note also
  that a <code>Dispatch</code> instance can accept a variable number of
  arguments, matching is done first on number of arguments, then on
  their types. If a <code>Dispatch</code> instance is called with any
  pattern that is not defined in a rule, a <code>TypeError</code> is raised.
  The initialization of <code>x_with_y()</code> with a fallback
  <code>(object,object)</code> pattern is not necessary if you simply want
  undefined cases to raise an exception.
</p>
<p>
  Each <code>(pattern,function)</code> tuple that is listed in the
  initialization call to <code>Dispatch</code> is simply passed on to the
  <code>.add_rule()</code> method; it is solely a matter of programmer
  convenience whether to establish rules on initialization or at
  a later point (you can mix-and-match, as in the prior example).
  When a function is called from the dispatcher, it is passed the
  arguments used in the call to the dispatcher; you need to make
  sure the function you use can accept the number of arguments it
  is matched against.  For example, the following are equivalent:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Explicit and dispatched function call</h4><pre>
# Define function, classes, objects
def func(a,b): print "The X is", a, "the Y is", b
class X(object): pass
class Y(object): pass
x, y = X(), Y()
# Explicit call to func with args
func(x,y)
# Dispatched call to func on args
from multimethods import Dispatch
dispatch = Dispatch()
dispatch.add_rule((X,Y), func)
dispatch(x,y)         # resolves to 'func(x,y)'

</pre></div><p>
  Obviously, if you alredy know the types of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> at
  design time, the machinery of setting up a dispatcher is just
  overhead.  But then, the same limitation is true of
  polymorphism--it is only helpful when you cannot constrain an
  object to a single type for every execution path.
</p>
<h3>Improving Inheritance</h3>
 <p>
  Multiple dispatch does not merely generalize polymorphism, it
  also provides a more flexible alternative to inheritence in
  many contexts.  An example is illustrative here.  Suppose you
  are programming a drawing or CAD program that deals with a
  variety of shapes; in particular, you want to be able to
  <em>combine</em> two shapes in a way that depends on both of the
  shapes involved.  Moreover, the collection of shapes to
  consider will be extended by derived applications or plugins.
  Extending a collection of shape classes provides a clumsy
  technique for enhancement, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Inheritence for capability extension</h4><pre>
# Base classes
class Circle(Shape):
    def combine_with_circle(self, circle): ...
    def combine_with_square(self, square): ...
class Square(Shape):
    def combine_with_circle(self, circle): ...
    def combine_with_square(self, square): ...
# Enhancing base with triangle shape
class Triangle(Shape):
    def combine_with_circle(self, circle): ...
    def combine_with_square(self, square): ...
    def combine_with_triangle(self, triangle): ...
class NewCircle(Circle):
    def combine_with_triangle(self, triangle): ...
class NewSquare(Square):
    def combine_with_triangle(self, triangle): ...
# Can optionally use original class names in new context
Circle, Square = NewCircle, NewSquare
# Use the classes in application
c, t, s = Circle(...), Triangle(...), Square(...)
newshape1 = c.combine_with_triangle(t)
newshape2 = s.combine_with_circle(c)
# discover 'x' of unknown type, then combine with 't'
if isinstance(x, Triangle): new3 = t.combine_with_triangle(x)
elif isinstance(x, Square): new3 = t.combine_with_square(x)
elif isinstance(x, Circle): new3 = t.combine_with_circle(x)

</pre></div><p>
  In particular, each existing shape class has to add
  capabilities in a descendent, which runs into combinatorial
  complexities, and difficulties in maintenance.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, a multiple dispatch technique is more
  straightforward:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Multimethods for capability extension</h4><pre>
# Base rules (stipulate combination is order independent)
class Circle(Shape): pass
class Square(Shape): pass
def circle_with_square(circle, square): ...
def circle_with_circle(circle, circle): ...
def square_with_square(square, square): ...
combine = Dispatch()
combine.add_rule((Circle, Square), circle_with_square)
combine.add_rule((Circle, Circle), circle_with_circle)
combine.add_rule((Square, Square), square_with_square)
combine.add_rule((Square, Circle),
                 lambda s,c: circle_with_square(c,s))
# Enhancing base with triangle shape
class Triangle(Shape): pass
def triangle_with_circle(triangle_with_circle): ...
def triangle_with_square(triangle_with_square): ...
combine.add_rule((Triangle,Circle), triangle_with_circle)
combine.add_rule((Triangle,Square), triangle_with_square)
combine.add_rule((Circle,Triangle),
                 lambda c,t: triangle_with_circle(t,c))
combine.add_rule((Square,Triangle),
                 lambda s,t: triangle_with_square(t,s))
# Use the rules in application
c, t, s = Circle(...), Triangle(...), Square(...)
newshape1 = combine(c, t)[0]
newshape2 = combine(s, c)[0]
# discover 'x' of unknown type, then combine with 't'
newshape3 = combine(t, x)[0]

</pre></div><p>
  The definition of new rules (and support functions/methods) is
  largely equivalent.  But the huge advantage of the multiple
  dispatch style is in the seamlessness with which you can
  combine shapes of unknown types.  Rather than revert back to
  explicit (and lengthy) conditional blocks, the rule definitions
  take care of matters automatically.  Even better, all
  combinining is done with a single <code>combine()</code> callable, rather
  than with a menagarie of distinct combinations methods.
</p>
<h3>Dispatch Propagation</h3>
 <p>
  Without needing to think about dispatch further, the
  <code>multimethods.Dispatch</code> class will select the "best fit" for a
  given call to a dispatcher. However, it is sometimes worth
  noticing that "best" is not "only." That is, a call to
  <code>dispatch(foo,bar)</code> might be close fit with a defined rule
  <code>(Foo,Bar)'<em>-but it might also be a loose (rather than non</em>) fit
  with '(FooParent,BarParent)</code>. Just as you sometimes want to call
  on superclass methods in an inherited method, you also sometimes
  want to call on less specific rules within a dispatcher.
</p>
<p>
  The <em><code>multimethods</code></em> module gives you both a quick way of calling
  less specific rules, and a more fine-tuned way.  At a rough
  level, you usually just want to automatically call a less
  specific rule at either the start or the end of execution of a
  code block.  Likewise, you almost always call a superclass
  method at either the start or end of a descendent method body.
  For a generic start/end call to less specific methods, you can
  just specify that as part of the rule. For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Automatic dispatch propagation</h4><pre>
class General(object): pass
class Between(General): pass
class Specific(Between): pass
dispatch = Dispatch()
dispatch.add_rule((General,), lambda _:"Gen", AT_END)
dispatch.add_rule((Between,), lambda _:"Betw", AT_END)
dispatch.add_rule((Specific,), lambda _:"Specif", AT_END)
dispatch(General())  # Result: ['Gen']
dispatch(Specific()) # Result: ['Specif', 'Betw', 'Gen']

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, in some cases (like the <code>(General)</code> rule), there is
  nothing less specific available in the defined rules. For
  uniformity, however, every call to a dispatcher returns a list of
  return values from all functions that control was propagated to.
  If neither <code>AT_END</code> nor <code>AT_START</code> is specified in the rules, no
  propagation occurs (and the returned list has length one). This
  explains the <code><em><code>0</code></em></code> indexing that probably looked mysterious in
  the shape example.
</p>
<p>
  The fine-tuned way of propagating control is with the
  <code>.next_method()</code> method of a dispatcher. In order to utilize
  manual propagation, you should define rules using the
  <code>.add_dispatchable()</code> method rather than the <code>.add_rule()</code>
  method. As well, the dispatched functions themselves should
  accept a <code>dispatch</code> argument.  The call to the dispatcher
  either needs a dispatch argument, or you can use the
  <code>.with_dispatch()</code> convenience method.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Programming with manual propagation</h4><pre>
def do_between(x, dispatch):
  print "do some initial stuff"
  val = dispatch.next_method() # return simple value of up-call
  print "do some followup stuff"
  return "My return value"
foo = Foo()
import multimethods
multi = multimethods.Dispatch()
multi.add_dispatchable((Foo,), do_between)
multi.with_dispatch(foo)
# Or: multi(foo, multi)

</pre></div><p>
  Manual propagation to less specific multimethods can get tricky
  in many of the same ways that calls to superclass methods can get
  tricky. To make things tractable, calls to <code>.next_method()</code>
  always return the simple return value of the up-call--if you want
  to assemble such return values into a list like the <code>AT_END</code>
  argument does, you will need to append and manipulate the values
  as you think appropriate. The most common "use case," however, is
  where a series of related initializations are peformed; in this
  case, the return values are usually irrelevant.
</p>
<h3>Note On Thread Safety</h3>
 <p>
  A quick interjection is worthwhile lest readers run into a
  problem. Because of the stateful way propagation tracks which
  (successively less specific) rules have been called, a dispatcher
  is not thread safe. If you wish to use a dispatcher in multiple
  threads, you should "clone" it for each thread. Doing so is
  inexpensive in memory and CPU resources, so there is no
  significant penalty for cloning dispatchers. For example, suppose
  a function might be called across thread; you can write:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>def threadable_dispatch(dispatcher, other, arguments)
    dispatcher = dispatcher.clone()
    #...do setup activities...
    dispatcher(some, rule, pattern)
    #...do other stuff...

</pre></div><p>
  If no new threads are spawned within <code>threadable_dispatch()</code>, all
  is well.
