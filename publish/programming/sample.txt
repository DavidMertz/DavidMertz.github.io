  A travel service application includes EJBs representing
  Customers and Itineraries.  The Customer Home defines the usual
  finder methods e.g., findCustomersByName() and
  findCustomersByPhoneNumber().  The Itinerary Home defines a
  finder supporting the association, namely
  findItinerariesByCustomer().  For security, three roles are
  defined:

     o Client
     o Agent
     o TravelService }
