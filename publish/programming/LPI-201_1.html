<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Understanding the Linux Kernel", the first of eight
  tutorials designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial
  you will learn how to understand, compile, and customize a Linux
  kernel.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About the Linux kernel
</h3>
 <p>
  This tutorial is one of the few in this series that is about Linux
  itself, strictly speaking. That is, a variety of tools for
  networking, system maintenance, manipulating files and data, and so
  on, are important for a working Linux installation and part of almost
  every Linux distribution.  But the base kernel--the bit of software
  that mediates between contending programs and access to hardware--is
  the software managed by Linus Torvalds and that is properly called
  "Linux itself."
</p>
<p>
  One of the best things about the Linux kernel is that it is Free
  Software.  Not only have many brilliant people contributed to making
  the Linux kernel better, but you, as system administrator, have access
  to the kernel source code.  This gives you the power to configure and
  customize the kernel to fit your exact requirements.
</p>
<h3>Kernel Components</h3>
 <h3>What makes up a kernel
</h3>
 <p>
  A Linux kernel is made up of the base kernel itself plus any number of
  kernel modules. In many or most cases, the base kernel and a large
  collection of kernel modules are compiled at the same time, and
  installed or distributed together, based on the code created by Linux
  Torvalds or customized by Linux distributors. A base kernel is always
  loaded during system boot, and stays loaded during all uptime; kernel
  modules may or may not be loaded initially (though generally some
  are), and kernel modules may be loaded or unloaded during runtime.
</p>
<p>
  The kernel module system allows the inclusion of extra modules that
  are compiled later, or separately from, the base kernel. Extra modules
  may be created either when you add hardware devices to a running Linux
  system, or sometimes are distributed by 3rd parties. Sometimes 3rd
  parties distribute kernel modules in binary form, though doing so
  takes away your capability as a system administrator to customize a
  kernel module. In any case, once a kernel module is loaded, it becomes
  part of the running kernel for as long as it remains loaded.  Contrary
  to some conceptions, a kernel module is not simply an API for talking
  with a base kernel, but becomes patched in as part of the running
  kernel itself.
</p>
<h3>Kernel naming conventions
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux kernels follow a naming/numbering convention that quickly tells
  you significant information about the kernel you are running. The
  convention used indicates a major number, minor number, revision, and
  in some cases vendor/customization string. This same convention
  applies to several types of files: the kernel source archive, patches,
  perhaps multiple base kernels (if you run several).
</p>
<p>
  As well as the basic dot-separated sequence, Linux kernels follow a
  convention to distinguish stable from experimental branches.  Stable
  branches use an even minor number, experimental branches an odd minor
  number.  Revisions are simply sequential numbers that represent bug
  fixes and backward compatible improvements.  Customization strings
  often describe a vendor or specific feature.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>linux-2.4.37-foo.tar.gz</code>: A stable 2.4 kernel source archive from
    the vendor "Foo Industries".
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <code>/boot/bzImage-2.7.5-smp</code>: A compiled experimental 2.7 base kernel
    with SMP support enabled.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <code>patch-2.6.21.bz2</code>: A patch to update an earlier 2.6 stable kernel
    to revision 21.
</blockquote>
<h3>Kernel files
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux base kernel comes in two versions, <code>zImage</code> which is limited
  to about 508 KB and <code>bzImage</code> for larger kernels (up to about 2.5 MB).
  Generally, modern Linux distributions us the <code>bzImage</code> kernel format
  to allow inclusion of more features.  You might expect that since the
  "z" in <code>zImage</code> indicates gzip compression, the "bz" in <code>bzImage</code>
  might mean bzip2 compression is used there--however, the <code>b</code> simply
  stands for "big" in this case (gzip compression is still used).  In
  either case, as installed in the <code>/boot/</code> directory, the base kernel
  is often renamed as <code>vmlinuz</code>.  Generally the file <code>/vmlinuz</code> is a
  link to a version names file such as <code>/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386</code>
</p>
<p>
  There are a few other files in the <code>/boot/</code> directory associated with
  a base kernel that you should be aware of (sometimes you will find
  these at the filesystem root instead). <code>System.map</code> is a table showing
  the addreses for kernel symbols. <code>initrd.img</code> is sometimes used by the
  base kernel to create a simple filesystem in a ramdisk prior to
  mounting the full filesystem.
</p>
<h3>Kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  Kernel modules contain extra kernel code that may be loaded after the
  base kernel.  Modules typically contain one of the following
  functions:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Device drivers: support for a specific type of hardware.
  </strong> Filesystem drivers: optional capability to read and/or write a
</p>
<blockquote>
    particular filesystem.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * System calls: most are supported in the base kernel, but kernel
</p>
<blockquote>
    modules can add or modify system services.
</blockquote>
<p>
  <strong> Network drivers: implement a particular network protocol.
  </strong> Executable loaders: parse and load additional executable formats.
</p>
<h3>Compiling A Kernel</h3>
 <h3>Obtaining kernel sources
</h3>
 <p>
  The first thing you need to do to compile a new Linux kernel is to
  obtain the source code for one.  The main place to find kernel sources
  is from<a href="http://www.kernel.org.">http://www.kernel.org.</a>  The provider of your distribution
  might also provide its own updated kernel sources that reflect
  vendor-specific enhancements.  For example, you might fetch an unpack
  a recent kernel version with commands similar to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cd /tmp/src/
% wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
% cd /usr/src/
% tar xvfy /tmp/src/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2

</pre></div><p>
  You may need root permissions to unpack the sources under /usr/src/.
  However, you are able to unpack on compile a kernel in a user
  directory. Check out kernel.org for other archive formats and download
  protocols.
</p>
<h3>Checking your kernel sources
</h3>
 <p>
  If you have successfully obtained and unpacked a kernel source
  archive, your system should contain a directory such as
  /usr/src/linux-2.6.12 (or a similar leaf directory if you unpacked the
  archive elsewhere).  Of particular important, that directory should
  contain a README file you may want to read for current information.
  Underneath this directory are numerous subdirectories containing
  source files, chiefly either <code>.c</code> or <code>.h</code> files.  The main work of
  assembling these source files into a working kernel is coded into the
  file <code>Makefile</code>, which is utilized by the <code>make</code> utility.
</p>
<h3>Configuring the compilation
</h3>
 <p>
  Once you have obtained an unpacked your kernel sources, you will want
  to configure your target kernel.  There are three flags to the
  <code>make</code> command that you can use to configure kernel options.
  Technically you can also manually edit the file <code>.config</code>, but in
  practice doing so is rarely desirable (you forgo extra informational
  context and can easily create an invalid configuration).  The three
  flags are <code>config</code>, <code>menuconfig</code> and <code>xconfig</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Of theses options, <code>make config</code> is almost as crude as manually
  editing the <code>.config</code> file--it requires you configure every options
  (out of hundreds) in a fixed order, with no backtracking. For text
  terminals <code>make menuconfig</code> gives you an attractive curses screen that
  you can navigate to set just the options you wish to modify.  <code>make
  xconfig</code> is similar for X11 interfaces, but adds a bit extra graphical
  eye-candy (especially pretty with Linux 2.6+).
</p>
<p>
  For many kernel options you have three choices: (1) Include the
  capability in the base kernel; (2) include it as a kernel module; (3)
  omit the capability entirely. Generally there is no harm (except a
  little extra compilation time) in creating numerous kernel modules,
  since they are not loaded unless needed. For space contrained media,
  you might omit capabilities entirely.
</p>
<h3>Running the compilation
</h3>
 <p>
  To actually build a kenel based on the options you have selected you
  perform several steps:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> <code>make dep</code>: only necessary on 2.4, no longer for 2.6.
  </strong> <code>make clean</code>: a good idea to clean up prior object files, especially
</p>
<blockquote>
    if this is not your first compilation of a given kernel tree.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>make bzImage</code>: this builds the base kenel.  In special
</p>
<blockquote>
    circumstances you might use <code>make zImage</code> for a small kernel image.
    You may also use <code>make zlilo</code> to install the kernel directly within
    the lilo boot loader; or <code>make zdisk</code> to create a bootable floppy.
    Generally it is a better idea to create the kernel image in a
    directory like <code>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/vmlinuz</code> with <code>make
    bzImage</code>, and manually copy from there.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>make modules</code>: build all the loadable kernel modules you have
</p>
<blockquote>
    configured for build.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>sudo make modules_install</code>: install all the built modules to a
</p>
<blockquote>
    directory such as <code>/lib/modules/2.6.12/</code>, where the directory leaf
    is named after the kernel version.
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating an initial ramdisk
</h3>
 <p>
  If you built important boot drivers as modules, an initial ramdisk is
  a way of bootstrapping the need for their capabilities during the
  initial boot process.  The especially applies to filesystem drivers
  that are compiled as kernel modules.   Basically, an initial ramdisk
  is a magic root pseudo-partition that lives only in memory, and is
  later 'chroot'ed to the real disk partition (for example, if your root
  paritition is on RAID; see tutorials 203 and 204).
</p>
<p>
  Creating an initial ramdisk image is performed with the command
  <code>mkinitrd</code>.  Consult the manpage on your specific Linux distribution
  for the particular options given to the <code>mkinitrd</code> command.  In the
  simplest case, you might run something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.6.12 2.6.12

</pre></div><h3>Installing the compiled Linux kernel
</h3>
 <p>
  Once you have successfully compiled the base kernel and its associated
  modules (this might take a while--maybe hours on a slow machine), you
  should copy the kernel image (<code>vmlinuz</code> or <code>bzImage) and the
  'System.map</code> file to your <code>/boot/</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have copied the necessary kernel files to <code>/boot/</code>, and
  installed the kernel modules using <code>make modules_install</code>, you need to
  configure your boot loader--typically <code>lilo</code> or <code>grub</code> to access the
  appropriate kernel(s).  See tutorial 202 for information on
  configuring <code>lilo</code> and <code>grub</code>.
</p>
<h3>Further information
</h3>
 <p>
  The kernel.org site contains a number of useful links to more
  information about kernel features and requirements for compilation. A
  particularly useful and detailed document is Kwan Lowe's <cite>Kernel
  Rebuild Guide</cite>, which you can find at
 <a href="http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html.">http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html.</a>  However,
  if you read this tutorial at a later date, confirm the URL for the
  latest location of this HOWTO at kernel.org.
</p>
<h3>Patching A Kernel</h3>
 <h3>Obtaining a patch
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux kernel sources are distributed as main source trees combined
  with much smaller patches.  Generally, doing it this way allows you to
  obtain a "bleeding edge" kernel with much quicker downloads.  As well,
  however, this arrangement lets you apply special-purpose patches from
  sources other than<a href="http://kernel.org.">http://kernel.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to patch several levels of changes, you will need to
  obtain each incremental patch.  For example, suppose that by the time
  you read this, a Linux 2.6.14 kernel is available, and you had
  downloaded the 2.6.12 kernel in the prior section.  You might run:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.13.bz2
% wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.14.bz2

</pre></div><h3>Unpacking and applying patches
</h3>
 <p>
  To apply patches, you must first unpack them using <code>bzip2</code> or <code>gzip</code>,
  depending on the compression archive format you downloaded, then apply
  each patch.  For example:
</p>
<p>
     % bzip2 -d patch2.6.13.bz2
     % bzip2 -d patch2.6.14.bz2
     % cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.12
     % patch -p1 &lt; /path/to/patch2.6.13
     % patch -p1 &lt; /path/to/patch2.6.14
</p>
<p>
  Once patches are applied, proceed with compilation as described in the
  prior section.  <code>make clean</code> will remove extra object files that may
  not reflect the new changes.
</p>
<h3>Customizing A Running Kernel</h3>
 <h3>About customization
</h3>
 <p>
  Much of what you would think of as customizing a kernel was discussed
  in the section of this tutorial on compiling a kernel.  Specifically,
  the <code>make [x|menu]config</code> options.  When compiling a base kernel and
  kernel modules, you may include or omit many kernel capabilities in
  order to achieve specific capabilities, run profiles, and memory
  usage.
</p>
<p>
  This section looks at ways you can modify kernel behavior at runtime.
</p>
<h3>Finding information about a running kernel
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) uses a special, and
  generally consistent and elegant technique to store information about
  a running kernel (or other running processes).  The special directory
  <code>/proc/</code> contains pseudo-files and subdirectories with a wealth of
  information about the running system.
</p>
<p>
  Each process that is created during the uptime of a Linux system
  creates its own numeric subdirectory with several status files. Much
  of this information is sumarized by userlevel commands and system
  tools, but the underlying information resides in the <code>/proc/</code>
  filesystem.
</p>
<p>
  Of particular note for understanding the status of the kernel itself
  are the contents of <code>/proc/sys/kernel</code>.
</p>
<h3>More about current processes
</h3>
 <p>
  While the status of processes, especially userland processes, does not
  pertain to the kernel per se, it is important to understand these if
  you intend to tweak an underlying kernel.  The easiest way to obtain a
  summary of processes is with the <code>ps</code> command (graphical and higher
  level tools also exist).  With a process ID in mind, you can explore
  the running process.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
16961 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
17239 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
% ls /proc/16961
binfmt   cwd@     exe@  maps  mounts  stat   status
cmdline  environ  fd/   mem   root@   statm

</pre></div><p>
  This tutorial cannot address all the information contained in those
  process pseudo-files, but just as an example, let us look at part of
  <code>status</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ head -12 /proc/17268/status
Name:   bash
State:  S (sleeping)
Tgid:   17268
Pid:    17268
PPid:   17266
TracerPid:      0
Uid:    0       0       0       0
Gid:    0       0       0       0
FDSize: 256
Groups: 0
VmSize:     2640 kB
VmLck:         0 kB

</pre></div><h3>The kernel process
</h3>
 <p>
  As with user processes, the <code>/proc/</code> filesystem contains useful
  information about a running kernel.  Of particular significance is the
  directory <code>/proc/sys/kernel/</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% ls /proc/sys/kernel/
acct           domainname  msgmni       printk         shmall   threads-max
cad_pid        hostname    osrelease    random/        shmmax   version
cap-bound      hotplug     ostype       real-root-dev  shmmni
core_pattern   modprobe    overflowgid  rtsig-max      swsusp
core_uses_pid  msgmax      overflowuid  rtsig-nr       sysrq
ctrl-alt-del   msgmnb      panic        sem            tainted

</pre></div><p>
   The contents of these pseudo files show information on the running
   kernel.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cat /proc/sys/kernel/ostype
Linux
% cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
4095

</pre></div><h3>Already loaded kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  As with other aspects of a running Linux system, information on loaded
  kernel modules lives in the <code>/proc/</code> filesystem.  Specifically in
  <code>/proc/modules</code>.  Generally, however, you will access this information
  using the <code>lsmod</code> utility (which simply puts a header on the display of
  the raw contents of <code>/proc/modules</code>; <code>cat /proc/modules</code> displays the
  same information.  Let us look at an example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% lsmod

</pre></div><h3>Loading additional kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  There are two tools for loading kernel modules.  The command
  <code>modprobe</code> is slightly higher level, and handles loading
  dependencies--that is, other kernel modules a loaded kernel module may
  need.  At heart, however, <code>modprobe</code> is just a wrapper for calling
  <code>insmod</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, suppose we want to load support for the Reiser filesystem
  into the kernel (assuming it is not already compiled into the kernel).
  We can use the <code>modprobe -nv</code> option to just see what the command
  would do, but not actually load anything:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>%  modprobe -nv reiserfs
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/fs/reiserfs/reiserfs.o.gz

</pre></div><p>
  In this case, there are no dependencies.  In other cases dependencies
  might exist (that would be handled by <code>modprobe</code> if run without <code>-n</code>).
  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% modprobe -nv snd-emux-synth
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/drivers/sound/soundcore.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/snd.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/synth/snd-util-mem.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/seq/snd-seq-device.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/snd-timer.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/seq/snd-seq.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/seq/snd-seq-midi-event.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/snd-rawmidi.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/seq/snd-seq-virmidi.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/core/seq/snd-seq-midi-emul.o.gz
/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/sound/synth/emux/snd-emux-synth.o.gz

</pre></div><h3>Loading additional kernel modules (continued)
</h3>
 <p>
  Suppose we want to load a kernel module now.  We can use <code>modprobe</code> to
  load all dependencies along the way, but to be explicit we will use
  <code>insmod</code>.
</p>
<p>
  From the prior page, we might think to run, e.g. <code>insmod
  snd-emux-synth</code>.  But if we do that without first loading the
  dependencies we will receive complaints about "unresolved symbols".
  So let us try Reiser filesystem instead, which stands alone:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% insmod reiserfs
Using /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13mdk/kernel/fs/reiserfs/reiserfs.o.gz

</pre></div><p>
  Happy enough, our kernel will now support a new filesystem.  We can
  mount a partition, read/write to it, and so on.  For other system
  capabilities, the concept would be the same.
</p>
<h3>Removing loaded kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  As with loading modules, unloading them can either be done at a higher
  level with <code>modprobe</code> or at a lower level with <code>rmmod</code>.  The higher
  level tool unloads everything in reverse dependency order.  <code>rmmod</code>
  just removes a single kernel module, but will fail if modules are in
  use (usually because of dependencies).  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% modprobe snd-emux-synth

  However, if a kernel module is eligible for removal, <code>rmmod</code> will
  unload it from memory, e.g.:
</p>

Checking reiserfs for persistent data

</pre></div><h3>Automatically loading kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  You can cause kernel modules to be loaded automatically, if you wish,
  using either the kernel module loader in recent Linux versions, or the
  <code>kerneld</code> daemon in older version.  If you use these techniques, the
  kernel will detect the fact it does not support a particular system
  call, then attempt to load the appropriate kernel module.
</p>
<p>
  However, unless you run in very memory constrained systems, there is
  usually no reason not to simply load needed kernel modules during
  system startup (see tutorial 202 for more information).  Some
  distributions may ship with the kernel module loader enabled.
</p>
<h3>Autocleaning kernel modules
</h3>
 <p>
  As with automatic loading, autocleaning kernel modules is mostly only
  an issue for memory constrained systems, such as embedded Linux
  systems.  However, you should be aware that kernel modules may be
  loaded with the <code>insmod --autoclean</code> flag, which marks them as
  unloadable if they are not currently used.
</p>
<p>
  The older <code>kerneld</code> daemon would make a call to <code>rmmod --all</code>
  periodically to remove unused kernel modules.  In special
  circumstances (if you are not using <code>kerneld</code>, which you will not on
  recent Linux systems), you might add the command <code>rmmod --all</code> to your
  <code>crontab</code>, perhaps running once a minute or so.  But mostly this whole
  issue is superfluous, since kernel modules generally use much less
  memory than do typical user processes.
