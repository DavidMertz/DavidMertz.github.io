<h2>Review of Python IDEs</h2>

    David looks at a half-dozen Python integrated development
    environments, and compares features, platforms, and stability
    across them.  He finds--perhaps as an unintended testament to
    the open source model--that the free products seem to stack
    up much better than the commercial ones.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>The Raw And The Cooked</h3>
 <p>
  I have had the opportunity in the last couple weeks to take a
  fresh look--or a first look--at a number of Python development
  environments.  While it will probably take a lot to sway me
  from a tried-and-true "favorite text editor, plus command-line"
  approach to Python development, interest in more comprehensive
  integrated development environments (IDEs) for Python is
  evident on Python discussion sites.
</p>
<p>
  My overall impression of Python IDEs leads me to a somewhat
  surprising conclusion.  Perhaps some general principle
  underlays this, or perhaps it is merely chance.  In general, I
  find the free tools quite a bit better than the commercial ones
  that cost money.
</p>
<p>
  Before I begin some reviews of actual IDEs, I should note a
  couple tools I did <em>not</em> have an opportunity to look at, but
  that readers might want to check out.  In my defense, there is
  probably quite enough covered in this summary for readers (and
  myself) to digest at once.
</p>
<p>
  PythonWorks Pro 1.1, from PythonWare looks promising.  It
  includes a <em><code>Tkinter</code></em> form designer, a modern editor, a
  debugger, and sleek looking screenshots.  It is available for
  Linux, Windows, and Solaris.  PythonWorks Pro is also a fairly
  pricely $400 product.  Unfortunately, I did not obtain a review
  copy of the final version in time for review.
</p>
<p>
  Boa Constructor is a rather impressive looking open source
  Python IDE, that includes a form designer for wxWindows.  It
  also appears to have a decent editor, debugger, project
  manager, and some other components.  Boa Constructor runs on
  Win32 and X11 (with wxWindows for the appropriate platform
  required).  Unfortunately, its home page bills its development
  status as "pre-alpha"; as pretty as the screenshots are, I
  felt it would be hard to recommend something in such an
  apparently early stage of development.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, the final class of tools not reviewed here are the
  dozens of excellent text editors out there that include varying
  Python-friendly features, such as syntax highlighting,
  execution windows, code-folding, macros, and many other
  features that even the best IDEs lack.  This is not the place
  to try to cover those, but there is a lot to be said for your
  favorite, and familiar, text editor.
</p>
<h3>Drawing A Baseline</h3>
 <p>
  There are a number of more-or-less standard free tools
  available for developing Python code.  In general, these tools
  are stable, consistent, and well-established.  On the other
  hand, the standard free tools are not necessarily all that
  flashy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Idle</strong> is a fairly basic IDE written in pure Python, using
  <em><code>Tkinter</code></em>.  Idle is part of all the standard Python
  distributions, and is even written by Guido van Rossum himself
  (at least originally, and in large part).  You should be able
  to run Idle anywhere you can run Python and <code>TK</code>.  Idle starts
  out as an enhanced interactive shell window (with a bit better
  cut-and-paste, scrollback, etc. than the basic interactive
  prompt).  Add to that a Python-aware editor (no code-folding,
  but nice syntax highlighting and code-completion),
  class-browser, and debugger.  The menus are TK "tear-off"
  style; that is, clicking on the dashed line at the top of any
  pull-down menu will promote that menu to its own persistent
  window.  The "Edit" menu in particular is nice if kept "docked"
  at the side of your desktop.  Idle's debugger provides,
  breakpoints, stepping and variable watches; but nothing so
  fancy as poking at memory locations and variable contents, or
  performing timings and other analyses.  Of course, usually my
  own debugging style is some scattered <code>print</code> statements, but
  your mileage may vary.
</p>
<p>
  A few glitches jump out in Idle--at least as of 0.6.  At least
  on my Win95r2 machine (where I have been playing with it),
  pop-up templates have an annoying habit of staying on screen
  and blocking what you are trying to type.  Probably more
  important is that it is really easy to freeze up Idle by
  running an errant script.  For example, the code <code>while 1:
  x=1</code> winds up requiring a forced-close of Idle itself, not just
  of that script's execution.  Obviously, one prefers not to
  write such code in the first place, but even the plain-old
  Python interactive session lets you kill it with a Ctrl-C (and
  the session with it, admittedly).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>PythonWin</strong> is, in most respects, a few steps better than Idle.
  Of course, as the name suggests, this tool is only for Win32
  users.  The easiest way to get PythonWin is probably to
  download the ActivePython 2.0 distribution, which is quite
  slick in itself (I installed build 203 for this column).
  ActiveState's Python includes a good collection of extra
  modules, with some selectable as extra downloads during the
  installation, such as <em><code>NumPy</code></em> and <em><code>PIL</code></em>.  In particular, one
  extra is PythonWin (Idle is also there), and the useful
  PythonCOM extensions for Windows scripting.  ActiveState makes
  non-Windows distributions also, but some components will not be
  relevant outside windows.
</p>
<p>
  PythonWin is extremely comfortable to work with (as much as one
  can be comfortable on Windows).  It has a nice editor, with
  code-folding, syntax highligting, and code-completion.
  PythonWin does not include any sort of form designer, as some
  IDEs do; but it has an excellent debugger with watches, code
  inspection, an interactive debug window, breakpoints, and
  everything you would expect in a debugger.  For the most part,
  PythonWin is stable, although once in a while some erratic
  freezeups have occurred while working with it on a Win95r2
  machine.  In appearance, PythonWin is fairly simple, but
  attractive, and makes nice use of paned and dockable elements
  (which I somewhat prefer to the Idle style of "many windows
  everywhere" which is shared by some other IDEs).  PythonWin also
  integrates with ActiveState's HtmlHelp version of Python
  documentation, and with PythonCOM.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>MacPython IDE</strong> is similar to PythonWin, modulo the platform
  difference.  Like Idle and PythonWin, MacPython IDE comes with
  its platform's standard distribution, and is free software
  (written by Just van Rossum).  The first thing I recommend
  doing after installing MacPython is grabbing the Advanced
  Editor Patch (see Resources).  Applying the patch was flakey in
  my attempt, but worked on the third try (I don't quite know
  what the problem was at first); with the patch you get syntax
  highlighting and some context-sensitive function/module help
  functions.  Besides being standard, MacPython IDE is the only
  IDE I know of for working with Python on the Mac. Fortunately,
  Just van Rossum has created something that is both very
  Pythonic and very Mac-like.
</p>
<p>
  With MacPython IDE you get a Python command window (which is
  more of a step for Macs, which have no command-line of their
  own), an editor, a debugger, and even a profiler.  Within the
  environment, you also have a function jump list, a module
  browser, and a few miscellaneous tools.  The debugger is good,
  but has no watches.  The editor is a bit crude "out of the
  box", but the patch mentioned adds syntax highlighting; but
  there is still no code-folding or code-completion (you do get
  contextual function docstrings with the patch).  Building in a
  profiler is something most of the IDEs do not include, so
  MacPython stands out here.
</p>
<h3>A Few Seconds Of Longitude</h3>
 <p>
  Under the "free but not standard" category, I had a chance to
  look at <strong>Komodo</strong>.  Komodo seems to have a fair amount of "buzz"
  around it, but it is still in beta, so it is not certain how it
  will pan out.  Komodo is a mutli-language, multi-platform IDE
  from ActiveState.  In an interesting decision--that may or may
  not amount to much--Komodo is based on the Mozilla framework.
  At first brush, it would seem that a web-browser would not
  necessarily have that much code that is useful for an IDE, but
  ActiveState seems to have put it to good use (Mozilla is trying
  to be a "platform" rather than just a browser, it is true).
</p>
<p>
  The Beta 1.3 I looked at supports development of Python, Perl,
  TCL, Javascript, and XML, with syntax highlighting of another
  dozen languages thrown in (but not much more language-wise
  yet).  The Python support is currently the strongest.  There is
  a beta available currently for Win32 and Linux, but other
  platforms might follow.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to think of Komodo, in my opinion, is as a
  superset of PythonWin. It does not share most of the same
  codebase, as far as I know, but it has a very similar feel to
  work with.  Because of the Mozilla heritage, Komodo is the
  slickest <em>looking</em> product in my roundup; but for the same
  reason it is also the slowest.  I would not recommend trying
  Komodo on an older machine--it is usable on the 366Mhz Win95r2
  machine I tested it on, but not speedy.  The debugger and
  editor look and feel similar to PythonWin; but you can edit a
  lot of extra languages, and debug Perl, as well as Python.
  Plus you can run Komodo on Linux.  One quite clever and unique
  Komodo feature is a "code check" feature that works like spell
  checkers in recent wordprocessors:  problem code is marked with
  a squiggly underline as you type; you can keep typing, but it
  is a good reminder to go back to fix the problem before you are
  done.  Komodo does <em>not</em> attempt to build in any sort of form
  designer or graphical programming, but other than that it seems
  quite well-rounded for a beta.
</p>
<h3>Crossing The Date Line</h3>
 <p>
  Now let us look at ways to spend money on Python IDEs. One
  imagines that commercial products would offer something extra
  to merit their money cost.  In some respects they do; but
  unfortunately, I found neither the $100 <strong>WingIDE</strong> nor the $80
  <strong>BlackAdder</strong> (but $400 for redistribution of components)
  sufficiently stable to recommend using them for live
  development.  Nominal feautures are not worth much if you
  cannot practically use the IDE.  Hopefully, both products will
  improve with versions and patches.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>BlackAdder</strong> is a QT-based development environment for Linux
  and Windows.  Of the products covered in this column, it is the
  only one with a form designer, and its form designer is itself
  quite nicely done (for <em><code>PyQT</code></em> programming).  Like Delphi,
  Visual Basic, and similar tools, you can place widgets on
  palettes, and play with their attributes and behaviors in a
  "properties" sheet The icons for elements have a somewhat
  blockish look, especially when grayed out, but the aesthetic
  issue is minor.  The source editor provides code-folding and
  syntax highlighting, but not code-completion tips.  BlackAdder
  has a decent debugger, on par with the free tools except for
  the lack of watches.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, in testing V1.0 Beta 2, I encountered some
  serious usability problems.  I tested the Mandrake, Slackware
  and Windows packages (but not Debian or Redhat, although I
  think the Linux variants are only packaging differences).
  Various problems occurred everywhere (perhaps in part because
  of reliance on exact OS versions and revisions).  For example,
  the default font was far too small to read on both Linux and
  Windows.  Changing the editor font required a quite tedious
  process of individually changing the font for each of 20 syntax
  markup elements (no "inherit font" option, as many text editors
  and IDEs have).  Worse than this, under both Mandrake 7.1 and
  a customized Slackware 7.1, the Python interpreter "terminates
  unexpectedly" when BlackAdder launches.  You can edit files,
  but not run them in the IDE.  My attempts to change Python
  paths--and point to either Python 2.0 or Python 1.5.2 managed
  to change the error message, but not fix things.  Further,
  under Windows I found that some Python scripts would not open
  under BlackAdder; I would get an "X is not a valid BlackAdder
  file" instead.  There was no obvious pattern to this message.
  These are the sorts of matters that one might be able to
  resolve with some work--but if you've just shelled out $400,
  you are usually not in a mood for debugging the product you
  purchased.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>WingIDE</strong> has the making of a quite nice IDE.  Its editor
  includes syntax highlighting for a large number of languages,
  although beyond that it is Python-oriented.  The source code
  browser is wonderfully useful for browsing projects/modules
  (presenting either navigable source, or docstring summaries).
  The debugger is well arranged, although without watches.  The
  editor has nice command-completion and a function jump list,
  but no code-folding.  The project-oriented style of the IDE
  would be useful for large products (better in this regard than
  most of the free IDEs, except Komodo).  The overall interface
  is somewhat similar to an enhanced Idle in using the "many
  windows" arrangement familiar in many TK and XWindow
  interfaces.  I prefer some use of docking and panes (but not
  the excesses of MS Visual Studio, in this regard), but
  different developers will like different styles of windowing.
  WingIDE has a lot of promise as a development environment.
</p>
<p>
  Like BlackAdder, however, WingIDE--in both the 1.0 and 1.1b3
  versions I tested--has problems that make it difficult to
  recommend for serious development.  There are some small
  annoyances, like the annoying license key configuration
  procedure, and the erratic--but mostly missing--tooltips for
  toolbars.  Also, little warts exist like the absence of an
  "open recent" menu item, and the fact you can only open an
  interactive shell window when a program is running (not just to
  experiment with code).  But those types of things are minor.
  The killer is WingIDE's habit of randomly generating
  segmentation faults on my Mandrake 7.1 box.  Everything dies in
  these cases, and you lose anything you were working on.  "Save
  often" may be good advice, but is not really enough to make
  WingIDE usable fulltime.
