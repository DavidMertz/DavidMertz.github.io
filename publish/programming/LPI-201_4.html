<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Working with Hardware", the fourth of eight tutorials
  designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial you will
  learn how to add and configure hardware to a Linux system, including
  RAID arrays, PCMCIA cards, other storage devices, displays, video
  controllers, and other components.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About hardware
</h3>
 <p>
  While you will often use userland tools to work with hardware devices,
  for the most part, basic support for those devices is provided by a
  Linux base kernel and/or by kernel modules.  One notable exception to the
  close connection between the Linux kernel and hardware devices is in
  graphics cards and computer displays.  A simple console text display
  is handled well enough by the Linux kernel (and even some graphics
  with framebuffer support), but generally advanced capabilities of
  graphics cards are controlled by XFree86, or more recently X.Org, X11
  drivers.  Almost all distributions include X11 and associated window
  managers and desktop environments; but for non-desktop servers, using
  X11 may be superfluous.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the information on adding hardware is contained in Topic 201
  on kernel configuration, or in Topic 203 on filesystems.  The LPI
  examp on this topic expects familiarity with kernel and filesystem
  tuning, so please refer to those other tutorials during exam
  preparation.
</p>
<h3>Configuring Raid</h3>
 <h3>What is RAID?
</h3>
 <p>
  RAID stands for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks", and provides
  mechanisms to combine multiple partitions on different hard drives
  into larger or more resilient virtual hard drives. Numerous RAID
  levels were initially defined, but only three remain in common use:
  RAID-0 (disk striping); RAID-1 (mirroring); and RAID-5 (striping with
  parity information).  Ocassionally RAID-4 is also used, which is like
  RAID-5, but puts parity information on exactly one drive rather than
  distributing it.
</p>
<p>
  The RAID support this tutorial discusses "new-style" RAID under Linux
  (the default for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, with backports to earlier
  kernels available). The "old-style" RAID initially present in 2.0 and
  2.2 kernels was buggy, and should not be used.  Specifically,
  "new-style" means the 0.90 RAID layer made by Ingo Molnar and others.
</p>
<h3>Using a RAID array
</h3>
 <p>
  There are two basic elements to using a RAID array. The simplest part
  of it is mounting the RAID device. Once a RAID (virtual) device is
  configured, it looks to the <code>mount</code> command the same as a regular
  block device partition. A RAID device is named as <code>/dev/mdN</code> once it
  is created, so you might mount it as, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mount /dev/md0 /home

</pre></div><p>
  You can also include a line in <code>/etc/fstab</code> to mount the RAID
  virtual partition (this is usually the preferred method).  The device
  device driver reads superblocks of raw partitions to assemble a RAID
  partition once it has been created.
</p>
<p>
  The more complicated part involves creating the RAID device out of
  relevant raw partitions. This part is not all <strong>that</strong> complicated, but
  there are more details to get right. Creating a RAID partition may be
  accomplished with the took <code>mkraid</code> combined with an <code>/etc/raidtab</code>
  configuration file.
</p>
<p>
  You may also use the newer tool <code>mdadm</code> which can usually operate
  without the need for a separate configuration file.  In most
  distributions, <code>mdadm</code> is supplanting <code>raidtools</code> (which includes
  <code>mkraid</code>), but this tutorial discusses <code>mkraid</code> to follow the LPI
  guidelines.  The concepts are similar either way, but you should read
  the <code>mdadm</code> manpage to learn about its switches.
</p>
<h3>The layout of /etc/raidtab
</h3>
 <p>
  The following definitions are used in the <code>/etc/raidtab</code> file, to
  describe the components of a RAID.  The below is not exhaustive, see
  the examples in the next panels or the
</p>
<p>
  * raiddev: The virtual disk partition provided by RAID (<code>/dev/md?</code>).
</p>
<blockquote>
    This is the device that <code>mkfs</code> and <code>fsck</code> work with, and that is
    mounted in the same way as an actual hard disk partition.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * raid-disk: The underlying partitions used to build a RAID.  They
</p>
<blockquote>
    should be marked (with <code>fdisk</code> or similar tools) as partition type
    0xFD
</blockquote>
<p>
  * spare-disk: These disks (typically there's only one) normally lie
     unused.  When one of the raid disks fails the spare-disk is brought
     online as a replacement.
</p>
<h3>Configuring RAID-0
</h3>
 <p>
  RAID-0 or "disk striping" provides more disk I/O bandwidth at the cost
  of less reliability (a failure in any one of the raid-disks and you
  loose the entire RAID device). For example the following
  <code>/etc/raidtab</code> entry sets up a RAID-0 device:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>raiddev /dev/md0
    raid-level      0
    nr-raid-disks   2
    nr-spare-disks  0
    chunk-size      32
    persistent-superblock   1
    device          /dev/sda2
    raid-disk       0
    device          /dev/sdb2
    raid-disk       1

</pre></div><p>
  This defines a RAID-0 virtual device called <code>/dev/md0</code>. The first 32k
  chunk of <code>/dev/md0</code> are allocated to /dev/sda2, the next 32k go on
  <code>/dev/sdb2</code>, the 3d chunk is on <code>/dev/sda2</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  To actually create the device, simply run:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% sudo mkraid /dev/md0

</pre></div><p>
  If you use <code>mdadm</code> switches will configure these options rather than
  the <code>/etc/raidtab</code> file.
</p>
<h3>Configuring RAID-1
</h3>
 <p>
  RAID-1 or "disk mirroring" simply keeps duplicate copies of the data
  on both block devices. RAID-1 gracefully handles a drive failure with
  no noticeable drop in performance. RAID-1 is generally considered
  expensive since half of your disk space is redundant. For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>raiddev /dev/md0
    raid-level      1
    nr-raid-disks   2
    nr-spare-disks  1
    persistent-superblock 1
    device          /dev/sdb6
    raid-disk       0
    device          /dev/sdc5
    raid-disk       1
    device          /dev/sdd5
    spare-disk      0

</pre></div><p>
  Data written to <code>/dev/md0</code> will be saved on both <code>/dev/sdb6</code> and
  <code>/dev/sdc5</code>. <code>/dev/sdd5</code> is configured as a <code>hot spare</code>. In the event
  <code>/dev/sdb6</code> or <code>/dev/sdc5</code> malfunctions, <code>/dev/sdd5</code> will be populated
  with data and brought online as a replacement.
</p>
<h3>Configuring RAID-5
</h3>
 <p>
  RAID-5 requires at least 3 drives and uses error correction to get
  most of the benefits of disk striping but with the ability to survive
  a single drive failure. On the postivie side, it requires only one
  extra redundant drive. On the negative side, RAID-5 is more complex,
  and when a drive does fail, it drops into <code>degraded mode</code> which can
  dramatically impact I/O performance until a spare-disk can be brought
  online and repopulated.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>raiddev /dev/md0
    raid-level        5
    nr-raid-disks     7
    nr-spare-disks    0
    persistent-superblock 1
    parity-algorithm  left-symmetric
    chunk-size        32
    device            /dev/sda3
    raid-disk         0
    device            /dev/sdb1
    raid-disk         1
    device            /dev/sdc1
    raid-disk         2
    device            /dev/sdd1
    raid-disk         3
    device            /dev/sde1
    raid-disk         4
    device            /dev/sdf1
    raid-disk         5
    device            /dev/sdg1
    raid-disk         6

</pre></div><h3>Using mke2fs or mke3fs
</h3>
 <p>
  If you format a RAID-5 virtual device using e2fs or e3fs, you may (and
  should) pay attention to the "stride" option. The -R stride=nn option
  will allow <code>mke2fs</code> to better place different ext2 specific
  data-structures in an intelligent way on the RAID device.
</p>
<p>
  If the chunk-size is 32 kB, it means, that 32 kB of consecutive data
  will reside on one disk. If an ext2 filesystem has 4 kB block-size
  then there will be eight filesystem blocks in one array chunk. We can
  indicate this information to the filesystem by running:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% mke2fs -b 4096 -R stride=8 /dev/md0

</pre></div><p>
  RAID-5 performance is greatly enhanced by providing the filesystem
  with correct stride information.
</p>
<h3>Kernel support and failures
</h3>
 <p>
  Enabling the <code>persistent-superblock</code> feature allows the kernel to
  start the RAID automatically at boot time.  New-style RAID uses the
  persistent superblock, and is supported in 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
  Patches are available to retrofit 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.
</p>
<p>
  Here's what happens when a drive fails:
</p>
<p>
  * RAID-0:  All data is lost
</p>
<p>
  * RAID-1/RAID-5:  The failed drive is taken offline, and the
</p>
<blockquote>
    spare-disk (if it exists) is brought online and populated with
    data.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The document "The Software-RAID HOWTO" in the Linux HOWTO project
  discusses swapping in drives for failed or updated drives, including
  when such drives are hot-swappable, and when a reboot will be
  required.  Generally, SCSI (or Firewire) are hot-swappable, while IDE
  drives are not.
</p>
<h3>Adding New Hardware</h3>
 <h3>About hardware
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux, especially in recent versions, has an amazingly robust and
  broad capability to utilize a variety of hardware devices.  In
  general, there are two levels of support that you might need to worry
  about in supporting hardware.  At a first level, there is a question
  of supporting a device at a basic system level; doing this is almost
  always by means of loading appropriate kernel modules for your
  hardware device.
</p>
<p>
  At a second level, some devices need more-or-less separate support
  from the X11R6 subsystem: generally either XFree86 or X.Org (very
  rarely, a commercial X11 subsystem is used, but this tutorial does not
  discuss that).
</p>
<p>
  Support for the main hot-swappable devices categories--i.e. those
  using PCMCIA or USB interface--are covered in their own major topics
  below.
</p>
<h3>About X11
</h3>
 <p>
  A quick note: X.Org is essentially the successor project to XFree86
  (technically a fork). While XFree86 has not officially folded, almost
  all distribution support has shifted to X.Org because of licensing
  issues. Fortunately, except for some minor renaming of configuration
  files, the initial code base for both forks is largely the same; some
  newer special features are more likely to be supported in X.Org only.
</p>
<p>
  X11R6 is a system for (networked) presentation of graphical
  applications on a user workstation. Perhaps counterintuitively, an "X
  server" is the physical machine that a user concretely interacts with,
  using its keyboard, pointing device(s), video card, display monitor,
  etc. An "X client" is the physical machine that devotes CPU time, disk
  space, and other non-presentation resources to running an application.
  In many or most Linux systems, the X server and X client are the
  self-same physical machine, and a very efficient local communication
  channel is used for an application to communicate with user I/O
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  An X server--such as X.Org--needs to provide device support for the
  I/O devices with which a user will interact with an application.
  Overwhelmingly, where there is any difficulty, it has to do with
  configuring video cards and display monitors. Fortunately, this
  difficulty has decreased in recent X.Org/XFree86 versions, with much
  more automatic detection performed successfully. Technically, an X
  server also needs to support input devices--keyboards and mice--but
  that is usually fairly painless since these are well standardized
  interfaces. Everything else--disk access, memory, network interfaces,
  printers, special devices like scanners, and so on--are all handled by
  the X client application, hence generally by the underlying Linux
  kernel.
</p>
<h3>Kernel device support
</h3>
 <p>
  Almost everything you need to know about device support in the Linux
  kernel boils down to finding, compiling and loading the right kernel
  modules.  That topic is covered extensively in the tutorial "Topic 201:
  Linux Kernel".  Readers should consult that tutorial for most issues.
</p>
<p>
  To review kernel modules, the main tools a system administrator needs
  to think about are <code>lsmod</code>, <code>insmod</code> and <code>modprobe</code>.  Also <code>rmmod</code> to
  a lesser extent.  The tool <code>lsmod</code>, <code>insmod</code> and <code>rmmod</code> are low-level
  tools to, respectively, list, insert, and remove kernel modules for a
  running Linux kernel.  <code>modprobe</code> performs these same functions at a
  higher level, by examining dependencies, then making appropriate calls
  to <code>insmod</code> and <code>rmmod</code> behind-the-scenes.
</p>
<h3>Examining hardware devices
</h3>
 <p>
  Several utilities are useful for scoping out what hardware you
  actually have available. The tool <code>lspci</code> provides detailed
  information on findable PCI devices (including those over PCMCIA or
  USB buses, in many cases). Correspondingly <code>setpci</code> can configure
  devices on PCI buses. <code>lspnp</code> lists plug-and-play BIOS device nodes
  and resources. <code>lsusb</code> similarly examines USB devices (and has a
  <code>setpnp</code> to modify configurations).
</p>
<h3>Setting up an X11 server (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  Basically, X.Org (or XFree86) come with a whole lot of video drivers
  and other peripheral drivers, and you need to choose the right ones to
  use.  Ultimately, the configuration for an X server lives in the
  rather detailed, and somewhat cryptic, file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> (or
  <code>xfree86.conf</code>).  A couple standard utilities can be used for somewhat
  friendlier modification of this file, but ultimately a text editor
  works.  Some frontends included with X.Org itself include <code>xorgcfg</code>
  for graphical configuration (assuming you have it working well enough
  to use that), and <code>xorgconfig</code> for a text based setup tool.  Many
  Linux distributions package friendlier frontends.
</p>
<p>
  The tool <code>SuperProbe</code> is often useful in detecting the model of your
  video card.  You may also consult the database
  <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/Cards</code> for detailed information on supported video
  cards.
</p>
<h3>Setting up an X11 server (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  Within the configuration file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>, you should create
  a series of <code>Section</code> ... <code>EndSection</code> blocks, each of which defines a
  number of details and options about a particular device.  These
  section names consist of:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Files:          File pathnames
  </strong> ServerFlags:    Server flags
  <strong> Module:         Dynamic module loading
  </strong> InputDevice:    Input device description
  <strong> Device:         Graphics device description
  </strong> VideoAdaptor:   Xv video adaptor description
  <strong> Monitor:        Monitor description
  </strong> Modes:          Video modes descriptions
  <strong> Screen:         Screen configuration
  </strong> ServerLayout:   Overall layout
  <strong> DRI:            DRI-specific configuration
  </strong> Vendor:         Vendor-specific configuration
</p>
<h3>Setting up an X11 server (part three)
</h3>
 <p>
  Among the sections, <code>Screen</code> acts as a master configuration for the
  display system. For example, you might define several <code>Monitor</code>
  sections, but select the one actually used with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>Section "Screen"
    Identifier    "Default Screen"
    Device        "My Video Card"
    Monitor       "Current Monitor"
    DefaultDepth  24
    SubSection "Display:
          Depth       24
          Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600"
    EndSubSection
    # more subsections and directives
Endsection

</pre></div><p>
  The section named <code>ServerLayout</code> is the real "master"
  configuration--it refers to both the <code>Screen</code> to use, and to various
  <code>InputDevice</code> sections. But if you have a problem, it is almost always
  with selecting the right <code>Device</code> or <code>Monitor</code>. Fortunately, DPMS
  monitors nowadays usually obviate the need to set painful <code>Modeline</code>
  options (in the bad old days, you needed to locate very specific
  timings on your monitors scan rates; usually DPMS handles this for you
  now).
</p>
<h3>Configuring Pcmcia Devices</h3>
 <h3>About PCMCIA
</h3>
 <p>
  PCMCIA devices are also sometimes called PC-Card devices. These
  (thick) credit-card sized peripherals are generally designed to be
  easily hot-swappable and transportable, and are used most widely in
  notebook computers. However, some desktop or server configurations
  also have PCMCIA readers, sometimes in an external chasis connected
  via one of several possible buses (a special PCI or ISA card, a USB
  translator, etc). A variety of peripherals have been created in PCMCIA
  form factor, including wireless and ethernet adaptors, microdrives,
  flash drives, modems, SCSI adapters, and other special purposes
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  Technically, a PCMCIA interface is a layer used to connect to an
  underlying ISA or PCI bus. For the most part, the translation is
  transparent--the very same kernel modules or other tools that
  communicate with an ISA or PCI device will be used to manage the same
  protocol provided via PCMCIA.  The only real special issue with PCMCIA
  devices is recognition of the insertion event and of the card type
  whose drivers should load.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays, the PCMCIA peripheral packaging is being eclipsed by USB
  and/or Firewire devices. While PCMCIA is a bit more convenient as a
  physical form-factor (usually hiding cards in the machine chasis), USB
  is closer to univeral on a range of machines.  As a result, many
  devices that have been packaged as PCMCIA in the past might now be
  packaged as USB "dongle" style devices, and these are more readily
  available at retail.
</p>
<h3>Recognizing a PCMCIA device (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  In modern kernels--2.4 and above--PCMCIA support is available as a
  kernel module.  Modern distribution will include this support, but if
  you compile a custom kernel, include the options CONFIG_HOTPLUG,
  CONFIG_PCMCIA, and CONFIG_CARDBUS.  The same support was previously
  available in separately in the "pcmcia-cs" package.
</p>
<p>
  The modules <code>pcmcia_core</code>, and <code>pcmcia</code> support loading PCMCIA
  devices.  <code>yenta_socket</code> is also generally loaded to support the
  "CardBus" interface (PCI-over-PCMCIA).  I.e.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% lsmod | egrep '(yenta)|(pcmcia)'
pcmcia                 21380  3 atmel_cs
yenta_socket           19584  1
pcmcia_core            53568  3 atmel_cs,pcmcia,yenta_socket

</pre></div><p>
  Once a card is inserted into a PCMCIA slot, the daemon <code>cardmgr</code> looks
  up a card in the database <code>/etc/pcmcia/config</code>, then loads appropriate
  supporting drivers as needed.
</p>
<h3>Recognizing a PCMCIA device (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  Let us take a look at the PCMCIA recognition in action.  I inserted a
  card into a Linux laptop with a PCMCIA slot, and with the previously
  listed kernel module support.  I can use the tool <code>cardctl</code> to see
  what information this peripheral provided:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cardctl ident
Socket 0:
  product info: "Belkin", "11Mbps-Wireless-Notebook-Network-Adapter"
  manfid: 0x01bf, 0x3302
  function: 6 (network)

</pre></div><p>
  This information is provided by the <code>pcmcia_core</code> kernel module by
  querying the physical card.  Once the identification is available,
  <code>cardmgr</code> scans the database to figure out what driver(s) to load.
  Something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% grep -C 1 '0x01bf,0x3302' /etc/pcmcia/config
card "Belkin FSD6020 v2"
  manfid 0x01bf,0x3302
  bind "atmel_cs"

</pre></div><p>
   In this case, we want the kernel module <code>atmel_cs</code> to support the
   wireless interface this card provides.  You can see what actually got
   loaded by looking at either <code>/var/lib/pcmcia/stab</code> or
   <code>/var/run/stab</code>, depending on your system, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% cat /var/run/stab
Socket 0: Belkin FSD6020 v2
0       network atmel_cs        0       eth2

</pre></div><h3>Debugging a PCMCIA device
</h3>
 <p>
  In the above example, everything worked seamlessly.  The card was
  recognized, drivers loaded, and the capabilities ready to go.  That is
  the best case.  If things are not as smooth, you might not find a
  driver to load.
</p>
<p>
  If you are confident that your PCMCIA device can use an existing
  driver (for example, it is compatible with another chipset), you can
  manually run <code>insmod</code> to load the appropriate kernel module.  Or, if
  you use this card repeatedly, you can edit <code>/etc/pcmcia/config</code> to
  support your card, indicating the needed driver.  However, guessing a
  needed module is unlikely to succeed--you need to make sure your card
  really is compatible with some other known PCMCIA card.
</p>
<p>
  Loading PCMCIA devices can be customized with the setup scripts in
  <code>/etc/pcmcia/</code>, each named for a category of function.  For example,
  when an 802.11b card like the above example loads, the script
  <code>/etc/pcmcia/wireless</code> runs.  You can customize these scripts if your
  device has special setup requirements.
</p>
<h3>Using "schemes" for different configurations
</h3>
 <p>
  If you need to use a PCMCIA device in multiple configurations, you may
  use the <code>cardctl scheme</code> command to set (or query) a configuration.
  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>% sudo cardctl scheme foo
checking: eth2
/sbin/ifdown: interface eth2 not configured
Changing scheme to 'foo'...
Ignoring unknown interface eth2=eth2.
% cardctl scheme
Current scheme: 'foo'.

</pre></div><p>
  In this case, I have not actually defined the <code>foo</code> scheme, but in
  general, if you change a scheme, device reconfiguration is attempted.
  Schemes may be used in setup scripts by examining the <code>$ADDRESS</code>
  varialbe.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># in /etc/pcmcia/network.opts (called by /etc/pcmcia/network)
case "$ADDRESS" in
work,*,*,*)
    # definitions for network in work scheme ...
    ;;
default,*,*,*)
    # definitions for network in default scheme ...
    ;;
esac

</pre></div><p>
  You may, of course, set schemes in initialization scripts, or via
  other triggering events (in a <code>cron</code> job, via a GUI interface, etc).
</p>
<h3>Configuring Universal Serial Bus Devices</h3>
 <h3>About USB
</h3>
 <p>
  As the section on PCMCIA mentioned, USB is somewhat newer technology
  that has largely eclipsed PCMCIA in importance. USB allows chaining of
  up to 127 devices on the same bus, using a flexible radial topology of
  hubs and devices. USB comes in several versions, with increasing
  speeds, the latest being 2.0. The latest USB version theoretically
  supports up to 480 Mbs. USB 1.1 supported the lower speed of 12 Mbs.
  In practice, there are a lot of reasons that particular devices might,
  in fact, operate much slower than these theoretical numbers--but it is
  still a reasonably fast bus interface.

<h3>Recognizing a USB device (part one)
</h3>

  At an administrative level, USB works very similarly to PCMCIA.  The
  kernel module <code>usbcore</code>.  Support is better in 2.4+ kernels than in
  earlier 2.2 kernels.  Above the <code>usbcore</code> level, one of several kernel
  modules support: <code>uhci</code>, <code>uhci_hcp</code>, <code>ohci</code>, <code>ohci_hcp</code>, <code>ehci</code>,
  <code>ehci_hcp</code>.  Exactly which kernel modules you need depends on the
  chipset your machine uses, and in the case of <code>ehci</code> whether it
  supports USB 2.0 high speed.  Generally, if you machine support <code>ehci</code>
  (or <code>ehci_hcp</code>), you will also want a backward-compatible <code>ehci</code>
  module loaded.  Brad Hards' "The Linux USB sub-system" contains
  details on exactly which chipsets support which kernel modules.  For
  multiuse kernels, you should just compile in all the USB modules.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming you get a kernel with the correct support, the hotplug
  subsystem should handle loading any drivers needed for a specific
  inserted USB device.  The file <code>/proc/bus/usb/devices</code> contains
  detailed information on the currently available USB devices (both hubs
  and peripherals).

<h3>Recognizing a USB device (part two)
</h3>

  Normally the USB bus is mounted as a dynamically generated filesystem,
  similar to the <code>/proc/</code> filesystem.  The filesystem type is known as
  either <code>usbdevfs</code> or <code>usbfs</code>.  Depending on your distribution,
  <code>/proc/bus/usb/</code> might get mounted either in initialization scripts
  such as <code>/etc/rcS.d/S02mountvirtfs</code>, or via an <code>/etc/fstab</code>
  configuraiton.  In the latter case, you might have a line like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># /etc/fstab
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs defaults 0 0

</pre></div><p>
  Otherwise, an initialization script might run something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb

</pre></div><p>
  The recognition of devices, and control over the USB subsystem is
  contained in the <code>/etc/hotplug/</code>, especially within
  <code>/etc/hotplug/usb.rc</code> and <code>/etc/hotplug/usb.agent</code>.  Inserting a USB
  device will <code>modprobe</code> a driver.  You may customize the initialization
  of a device further by creating a <code>/etc/hotplug/usb/$DRIVER</code> script
  for your particular peripheral.
