    SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML
    [XML10]. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector
    graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and
    curves), images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled,
    transformed and composited into previously rendered objects. The
    feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha
    masks, filter effects and template objects.

    SVG is a platform for two-dimensional graphics. It has two parts: an
    XML-based file format and a programming API for graphical
    applications. Key features include shapes, text and embedded raster
    graphics, with many different painting styles. It supports scripting
    through languages such as ECMAScript and has comprehensive support
    for animation.

    SVG is a royalty-free vendor-neutral open standard developed under
    the W3C Process. It has strong industry support; Authors of the SVG
    specification include Adobe, Agfa, Apple, Canon, Corel, Ericsson,
    HP, IBM, Kodak, Macromedia, Microsoft, Nokia, Sharp and Sun
    Microsystems. SVG viewers are deployed to over 100 million desktops,
    and there is a broad range of support in many authoring tools.
