WHAT IS TEXTPAD?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  TextPad is a nicely featured, inexpensive text editor for Win32
  platforms.  It includes a number of features that are helpful
  for programmers; and it presents a very nice interface that is
  easy to work with.

  TextPad is generally more powerful than the free-of-cost PFE,
  which I reviewed earlier for Webreview.com. On the hand,
  TextPad is generally a less powerful than the Win32 editor I
  use the most (Boxer 99, which costs about twice as much as
  TextPad).  TextPad is also strictly Win32; it does not have a
  Win16 version, let alone ones for Linux, OS/2, MacOS, or other
  platforms (for one cross-platform and open-source option, see
  my review of FTE).


THE FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  First let's talk about the interface to TextPad.  I think this
  is the very best thought-out part of TextPad.  All the
  interface elements can be easily enabled or disabled, so you
  can make TextPad look and work the way you want.  In general
  TextPad consists of a paned interface that includes a "Clip
  Library", "Document Selector", MDI document windows, various
  optional toolbars, and (my favorite) filetabs that show the set
  of open documents.  I prefer a pretty spartan look to my text
  editors (and don't think a mouse has a lot of use in one), so
  the first thing I did was turn off the toolbars.  But the
  filetabs are an excellent convention for keeping track of which
  several documents you are working on at a given time (TextPad's
  Document Selector actuall serves almost the same purpose, but
  uses a pane to do it).

  What else does TextPad have?

  - Syntax Highlighting.  Only keyword-based syntax highlighting
    is supported.  This is not as exotic as regex or state-
    machine methods.  But it does 99% of what you reasonably want
    it to.

  - Simple keystroke macro facility.  This is pretty basic: you
    can repeat sequences of actions (including repeatedly).  But
    you do not get a full scripting language (but you quite
    likely do not need one).

  - Good regular-expression search and replace capabilities. Some
    editors allow regex's in search patterns, but not
    backreferences in replacement patterns.  TextPad does both.

  - Spell checkers for multiple languages.

  - Quite good built-in document comparison tool.

  - Handles column selection (and important item on my
    checklist).

  - Case changes in blocks, indentation changes in blocks,
    transpositions of lines/words.

  - Bookmarks are implemented with an icon to the left of
    bookmarked lines

  - Configurable key-bindings, language-modes, syntax colors,
    menus (to some extent), editing behavior, and various other
    bits.  Overall, almost everything about TextPad is easy to
    customize.

 The Clip Library is an interesting and somewhat unusual feature
 of TextPad.  You can optionally have a pane (or floating window)
 that contains snippets you'd like to insert in a document.
 Macros could be used for this purpose, but the Clip Library is
 quicker and more intuitive.  And it comes with a nice predefined
 set for HTML tags (for other languages, you'll have to roll your
 own).


THE MIS-FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  TextPad does not have any of the sophisticated means of
  structuring code that some editors have.  No folding sections,
  no CTags, no navigable function definitions.  Those features
  are probably too much to ask for in inexpensive shareware.  But
  there *are* a few things that TextPad could stand to do better,
  even within its scope.

  - Word wrap/indent is subtlely broken in several ways.  This
    makes working with paragraph text files more difficult (FAQs,
    READMEs, articles in ASCII).  For example, wrap margin is set
    globally for a document, and there does not seem to be a way
    to make different paragraphs reformat to different widths (or
    if there is, I couldn't find it).  And creating outdented
    bullet paragraphs seems to require some manual hard-returns
    to work around the automatic indent/wrap rules.

  - The language modes and clip libraries that ship with TextPad
    are quite limited.  For example, the three document types I
    am most likely to work with right now are Python, XML, and
    textual articles.  The wrap/indent problems make the latter
    difficult.  The first two have no built-in language mode
    support (adding your own isn't hard though).  But most
    editors have a better set of language modes "in the box."

  - The shareware version is actually nagware, and pops up a
    reminder box every once in a while.  This is not bad as
    nagware goes, but I tend to have a negative sentiment about
    the idea (but then, I prefer free software).

  - Some features seem hard to find on the menus--like
    View/Document Properties/Document Tab for a word count.  Once
    you learn a quirk or two, it is fine, but the menus might be
    done more intuitively.



ABOUT THE AUTHOR

  There is hardly anything David Mertz feels more strongly about
