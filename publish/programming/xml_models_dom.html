  <h2>About This Series</h2>
   
  <p>  As XML has developed into a widely used data format, a number   of
    programming models have arisen for manipulating XML   documents.  Some
 of   these models--or "paradigms"--have been   enshrined as standards, while
  others  remain only informally   specified (but equally widely used nonetheless).
     In a general   way, the several models available for manipulating XML
   documents closely mirror the underlying approaches and   techniques that
  programmers in different traditions bring to   the task of working with
XML.   It is worth noticing that   "models" are at a higher level of abstraction
  than a particular   programming language; most of the models discussed
in   this   series are associated with APIs that have been implemented in
  multiple   programming languages. </p>
   
  <p>  In part, the richness of available XML programming models   simply
    allows programmers and projects to work in the ways that   are most comfortable
    and familiar to them.  In many ways, there   is overlap--at least in
achievable     outcomes--between all the   XML programming models.  However,
different   models  also carry   with them specific pros and cons in the
context of XML    manipulation;  and these might urge the use of particular
models   for particular projects.   This series of five articles aims to
  provide readers with an overview of the costs, benefits, and   motivations
for all of the major approaches to programmatic   manipulation of XML documents
(manipulation  here, should be   understood also to mean "using XML to drive
or communicate    other application  processes"). </p>
   
  <p>  The current article, Part 1, discusses the Document Object   Model
    (DOM), which is a W3C Recommendation.  DOM is an Object   Oriented Programming
    (OOP) approach to the manipulation of XML   documents.  Part 2 of this
 series   will address the Simple API   for XML (SAX), which is an event-driven
 and   procedural style of   XML programming.  Part 3 will look at XSLT,
which   brings  a   declarative programming style to transformations of XML
  documents.     In Part 4, we will see the application of   full-fledged
Functional Programming     (FP) techniques to XML   manipulation--these in
some ways unify the earlier     models (but   are less commonly used).  The
final installment, Part 5,  will     look briefly at a number of tools and
techniques that did not   quite fit into the previous discussion, but that
readers would   do well to be aware of. </p>
   
  <h2>DOM's Conceptual Framework</h2>
   
  <p>  DOM represents an XML document as a <code>Node</code>, which contains, 
      hierarchically, zero or more "child" <code>Node</code>'s.  What is OOP
   about   a particular DOM tree is its containment tree, not any   inheritence
  trees   (although there is also an inheritence   structure to the special<code>
    Node</code>     types).  In fact, every such   descendent <code>Node</code>
     has pretty  much the same structure as the   <code>Document</code> itself.
   Conceptually,   every <code>Node</code> is a fairly   ordinary in-memory
  object from the  point-of-view of an   object-oriented programming language.
   A <code>Node</code>    is just an   object which has a few API-specified
  attributes/data-members,     and a few methods/member-functions (the terminology
  varies   between languages).     </p>
   
  <p>  There are two wrinkles to the system to address immediately.   First,
    there are actually two sorts of "children" that a<code>Node</code>  
might     have.  Some types of <code>Node</code>'s have children, while others
  do   not.  One type of child is an 'ELEMENT_NODE's subelements,   the other
 is   its XML attributes.  These two types of children   are both specialized
  'Node's  themselves.  Subelements are found   in the DOM <code>Node</code>
      data-member    <code>childNodes</code>; XML attributes are   found
in  the data-member   <code>attributes</code>. </p>
   
  <p>  This brings us to the second wrinkle.  As well as <code>Node</code>
           objects, DOM has two types of collection objects.  Ordered   collections
    of <code>Node</code> objects live in a <code>NodeList</code> object.
  Unordered   collections of named <code>Node</code> objects line in a  
  <code>   NamedNodeMap</code>     .  The value of the <code>childNodes</code>
 data-member,  for   example,  is a <code>NodeList</code> (several <code>
Node</code> methods  also return  a   <code>NodeList</code>).  The value
of the <code>attributes</code>    data-member,   in   contrast, is a <code>
NamedNodeMap</code>. </p>
   
  <p>  Node collections have a nice property:  they are "live"   connections
    to the underlying DOM <code>Document</code>.  A list or map is   not
just     a snapshot of an XML document at a moment in time, but   is the
actual  collection   of <code>Node</code> objects that fulfill some   property
(like  living under   a particular parent).  The W3C DOM   FAQ emphasizes
this:   </p>
   
  <blockquote>    NodeList, although it resembles an array or vector (it
has a     length attribute, and you can access the members of the list  
  via an integer index), is <em>not</em> an array.  Think of it     instead
as another way of looking at the DOM's document tree.     If that tree changes
        <em></em> if something inserts or appends or     removes Nodes <em></em>
         the NodeList will be automatically adjusted     at the same time.
  The   result is that a NodeList is always an     accurate representation 
 of the   getChildNodes or     getElementsByTagName results as if you had 
just issued   that     call, so there is no need to refresh the NodeList to
pick up     changes to the underlying document. </blockquote>
     
    <p>  The overall picture here is that a DOM object represents an   entire
    XML document, but it is possible to provide "handles" or   "pointers"
or   "proxies" into particular parts or samples of the   structure for convenience.
        </p>
     
    <h2>Types Of Nodes</h2>
     
    <p>  Nodes are lower level and more numerous than one might expect  
at first.  Basically, <em>everything</em> is a <code>Node</code>, but they
come   in different types.  In terms of OOP inheritance, all the   specific
types descend from the abstract class <code>Node</code>.  Each   concrete
node is one of the following types:  ELEMENT_NODE,   ATTRIBUTE_NODE, TEXT_NODE,
    CDATA_SECTION_NODE, ENTITY_NODE,   PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE,
    DOCUMENT_NODE,   DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE, NOTATION_NODE.  These types are
fairly       self-explanatory, and the uppercase names indicated are usually
  defined     as constants in a particular DOM implementation (import   syntax
and name     qualification will depend on the programming   language). </p>
     
    <p>  The top <code>Node</code> of any DOM representation of an XML document
    is   a DOCUMENT_NODE.  This <code>Document</code> node will contain zero
   or   more PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE's and COMMENT_NODE's, and   <em>
exactly     one</em> ELEMENT_NODE.  The one ELEMENT_NODE is the root   element
of the    XML document.  The root element, in turn, may   contain nodes of
the various    other types--and perhaps children   of the root will contain
nodes of the    various types. </p>
     
    <p>  TEXT_NODE's in particular are a little suprising in their   behavior.
     On the one hand, one might expect the text of an   element to simply
be   a string-type data-member of an   ELEMENT_NODE.  In some ways that would
  be more convenient.  But   instead, the textual contents inside an XML
element     is   contained in its own TEXT_NODE.  And being a type of <code>
Node</code>        , a   TEXT_NODE is not itself a string, but is instead
a DOM object    whose <em>attribute</em><code>nodeValue</code> has a string
in it.   Its     <code>nodeName</code>, for what it's worth, contains the
string       <code>#text</code>. </p>
     
    <p>  But the thing that is most surprising about TEXT_NODE's is that 
 they are not guaranteed to contain <em>all</em> the text inside a   particular
    element, even if there is nothing other than text in   the element. 
A  TEXT_NODE   is simply promised to contain <em>some</em>   text--the entire
 textual content   of an ELEMENT_NODE might be   split between any number
of TEXT_NODE's.  Fortunately,  the DOM   method <code>normalize()</code>
can be used to transform a DOM tree, and   minimize the number of TEXT_NODE's
 contained (and more   importantly,  make each such node of maximal relevant
 length). </p>
     
    <h2>DOM At Work</h2>
     
    <p>  If you are like me, it is hard to process the abstract   descriptions
    of DOM without some concrete code to look at.  To   show readers what
is   going on, I will use some commands pasted   from a Python interactive
shell.    DOM implementations exist in   Java, C++, ECMAScript, Perl, Ruby,
and many   other programming   languages.  A nice thing about DOM is that
the code usually     looks almost the same across languages.  But Python
has two   advantages   for presentation:  (1) it has an interactive shell
  to try variations on   commands (what the user types is preceded   by<code>
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> );  (2) its code is particularly concise, and resembles
  pseudo-code.   In general,  in this series I will make efforts to   avoid
using constructs   which are idiomatic to one particular   programming language
(so Python programmers  may find that there   is a more "Pythonic" way of
implementing my examples). &nbsp;In the code samples, those elements that
are generic DOM (and common to all languages) are marked in red.        
  </p>
     
    <p>  For this simple demonstration, I created the following trivial 
 XML document: </p>
     
    <div align="Center">     
    <h3>test.xml</h3>
     </div>
     
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" bgcolor="#e0e0e0" align="Center">
       <tbody>
         <tr>
           <td valign="Middle">

           </td>
         </tr>
       
      </tbody>     
    </table>

         </tr>

    <p>  Our start shows off several DOM features.  After the requisite 
 imports, we generally create a DOM object by parsing an XML   document using
    a <code>parse()</code> or <code>parseString()</code> method.  The   latter
    allows XML documents to come from a source other than a   file.  Neither
   of these methods is actually part of the W3C   standard, but both are
present     in almost every implementation.   We also might have created
a new DOM  object   from scratch, but   starting with an existing XML document
is more  common.       </p>
     
    <p>  When we check, we find that a <code>Document</code> node has no 
 <code>attributes</code>; it does, however, have some <code>childNodes</code>
        .  One of   the <code>childNodes</code> is the same as the <code>
documentElement</code>         (as is   demonstrated).  In our example, another
child of <code>Document</code>         is   a processing instruction.  In
this paricular DOM   implementation--and     in a number of others--comment
nodes are   ignored by the parser (and do   not appear in the <code>childNodes</code>
).   While this limitation is not   usually a problem since the   programmatic
content should not be in comments,   it is something   to be aware of. </p>
     
    <p>  Let us start working with the root node of the document, which 
 is what we are usually concerned with (and the descendents   thereof). 
Any descendent element will behave almost exactly   the same way the root
node does. </p>

    <p>  The attributes are interesting in their behavior.  If you   happen
    to know that an ELEMENT_NODE has a specific attribute,   it is easy to
 get   its value with a method call.  But if you are   not sure what XML
attributes     are present, you have to use a   slightly more roundabout
technique of  first   looking at the   <code>NamedNodeMap</code> data-member
    <code>length</code>        , then iterating through the   attributes
based on the number of them.     Guessing an XML   attribute that might be
present is not really reliable--this       Python DOM implementation returns
an empty string if the   attribute does   not exist.  But this implementation
is flawed,   since it cannot distinguish    the below cases (vis-a-vis the
  <code>color</code> attribute): </p>

    <h2>The Good And The Bad Of DOM</h2>
     
    <p>  The strong point of DOM is that it provides an OOP framework   for
    manipulating XML documents that will be familiar to   programmers in
many     object oriented languages.  The method and   attribute names suggest
a  particular   affinity with Java, but   the model is common to OOP thinking.
  Moreover,   although the   short article has not touched on it in any detail,
 DOM provides     a strong set of <code>Node</code> methods for filtering
and modifying   nodes and collections. </p>
     
    <p>  The weak point of DOM is that it is very poorly suited for   handling
    large XML documents.  For the trivial case we have   presented there
is   no  issue, but DOM is extremely memory   hungry.  A DOM representation
of   an XML document is likely to   be several times the size of the underlying
  document  (each   <code>Node</code> needs an object, and carries a variety
  of instance    data).  While DOM readers that operate incrementally upon
   file-based  XML documents are in experimental stages, by far the   rule
 is to read in  an entire XML document at one time in order   to create a
DOM object.  OOP  programmers are often lured by the   familiarity of DOM
techniques, but consequently  make decisions   that use resources inefficiently.
 In some ways, the SAX    approach that the next installment will address
answers the   limits of  DOM (but introduces its own set of limitations.

    <h2>Resources</h2>
     
    <p>  The official word on everything DOM is at the World Wide Web   Consortium's
    (W3C) website.  Many links to further resources   can be found there
also:         </p>
