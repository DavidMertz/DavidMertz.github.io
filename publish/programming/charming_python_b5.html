    Simple generators, introduced in Python 2.2, may be used to
    simplify state machines and to simulate coroutines.  A much
    earlier <cite>Charming Python</cite> presented an abstract pattern for
    state machine processing.  Since that time, the introduction
    of simple generators has provided some even more natural
    paradigms for describing machines.  Coroutines are an
    "exotic" flow mechanism that few widely-used languages allow
    (not even non-Stackless Python).  Python's new generators,
    however, get us <em>almost</em> all the way to coroutines, and the
    extra few steps can be faked.  Explanation of the relevant
    concepts are accompanied by code samples.

<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  It takes a while to completely "get" Python 2.2's new
  generators.  Even after writing an earlier <cite>Charming Python</cite>
  installment that introduced simple generators, I could not say
  that I fully understood the "gestalt" of generators.  This
  article presents some additional patterns for the use of
  generators, and hopefully brings both myself and readers
  further into the mindset of "resumable functions."
</p>
<p>
  There is a lot good about simple generators.  In addition to
  offering more natural ways of expressing the flow of a class of
  problems, generators prove to make many problems dramatically
  more efficient.  In Python, function invocation is rather
  expensive; among other factors, function arguments lists take a
  while to sort out (positional and default arguments need to be
  parsed, among other things).  Also, initializing a frame object
  takes some setup steps (according to Tim Peters, on
  comp.lang.python, over 100 lines of C; I have not examined the
  Python source myself).  Resuming a generator, in contrast, is
  quite cheap; the arguments have already been parsed, and the
  frame object is just sitting around waiting for resumption
  (almost no extra initialization is needed).  Of course, if
  speed is tantamount, you should not be using aa byte-code
  compiled dynamic language; but even where speed is not the
  primary concern, faster is better than slower.
</p>
<h3>Revisiting State Machines</h3>
 <p>
  In <cite>Charming Python</cite> #4, I presented a <code>StateMachine</code> class
  that allowed users to add as many state handlers as were needed
  for a given machine.  In the model, one or more states are
  defined as end states, and exactly one state is defined as a
  start state (calls to the class methods configure this).  Each
  handler had a certain required structure; a handler would
  perform a series of actions, then after a while return to a
  loop in the <code>StateMachine.run()</code> method with a flag indicating
  the desired next state.  As well, a <code>cargo</code> variable was used
  to allow one state to pass some (unprocessed) information on to
  the next state.
</p>
<p>
  A typical use for the <code>StateMachine</code> class I presented would be
  to consume input in a stateful way.  For example, a text
  processing tool (Txt2Html) I use reads lines from a file; each
  line needs to be processed in a particular fashion, depending
  on which category the line belongs in.  However, one often
  needs to look at the context provided by immediately prior
  lines to determine which category the current line belongs in
  (and how it should be processed).  An implementation of this
  process built around the <code>StateMachine</code> class might define a
  handler <code>A</code> that reads lines for a while, and processes them in
  an A-like manner.  After a while, a condition is satisfied such
  that the next batch of lines should be processed by the <code>B</code>
  handler.  <code>A</code> passes control back to the <code>.run()</code> loop, with
  the instruction to transition to the <code>B</code> state--along with any
  extra line(s) that <code>A</code> could not properly handle, and <code>B</code>
  should before reading additional lines.  Eventually, some
  handler passes its control to some state designated as an end
  state, and processing halts.
</p>
<p>
  For the concrete code example in the prior installment, I used
  a simplified application.  Rather than process lines, I
  processed a stream of numbers that were produced by an
  iterative function.  Each state handler simply printed those
  numbers that were within its desired numeric range (along with
  some messages about the operative state).  When a number in the
  stream passed into a different range, a different handler took
  over the "processing."  For this installment, we will look at
  another way of implementing the same numeric stream handling
  using generators (with some extra wrinkles and capabilities).
  But a more sophisticated generator example is likely to deal
  with something more like the input streams mentioned in the
  prior paragraph.  It is worth reminding ourselves about the
  earlier state machine with an abridged version of that code:

<h3>Using Generators</h3>
 <p>
  The entire generator-based version of our state machine is
  slightly longer than the code samples I prefer to present in
  this column.  However, the below code sample is the entire
  application, no separate <em><code>statemachine</code></em> module is imported for
  support.  In total, this version is shorter than the
  class-based one (and we will see that its does something extra,
  and very powerful).

  There are a number of observations to make about our
  generator-based state machines.  A first point is fairly
  cosmetic.  We arranged <code>stategen_test.py</code> to use only
  functions, not classes--generators, to my mind at least, have
  much more of a functional programming feel than an OOP feel.
  But one could easily wrap the same general model in one or more
  classes if desired.
</p>
<p>
  The main function in our sample is <code>scheduler()</code>, which is
  perfectly generic (while being quite a bit shorter than the
  <code>StateMachine</code> class in the earlier pattern).  The function
  <code>scheduler()</code> requires as arguments a dictionary of
  generator-iterator objects ("instantiated" generators).  The
  string names given to each generator can be whatever one
  wants--the literal names of the generator-factory functions is
  one obvious choice, but I use capitalized keyword names in my
  example.  The <code>scheduler()</code> function also accepts a "start
  state" as an argument, although perhaps a default value could
  be selected automatically if that was desired.
</p>
<p>
  Each generator "scheduled" obeys some simple conventions.  Each
  generator runs for a while, then yields a pair that contains
  the desired jump and some "cargo"--just as with the prior
  model.  No generator is marked specifically as an "end state."
  Instead we allow individual generators the option of raising an
  error to break out of <code>scheduler()</code>--specifically, a generator
  will raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception if the generator "fall
  off" the end or gets to a <code>return</code> statement.  One could catch
  that exception (or a different one), if desired.  In our case,
  we use a <code>sys.exit()</code> to terminate the application, which is
  encountered within the <code>exit()</code> generator.
</p>
<p>
  Two more small notes on the code.  Instead of an iterative
  function to generate our numeric sequence, the above sample
  uses a much cleaner looping generator-iterator.  Rather than
  have continually to pass back in the "last value", the
  generator simply issues an (infinite/indefinite) stream of
  numbers with each successive call.  It is a nice, albeit small,
  illustration of a generator.  As well, the above isolates the
  "state transition" table in a separate function.  In a
  realistic program, the state transition jumps would be much
  more context dependent, and would probably be determined in the
  actual generator bodies.  This approach simplifies the example.
  For what it is worth, we could have simplified even further by
  producing the generator functions out of a single function
  factory; but the general case would not have each generator so
  similar to the others as to make this feasible.
</p>
<h3>Coroutines And Semi-coroutines</h3>
 <p>
  Careful readers will have noticed that we have actually
  smuggled in a much more powerful flow-control structure than
  was initially admitted.  There is more than a state machine
  going on in the sample code.  The pattern above is, in fact,
  effectively a general system for coroutines.  Most readers will
  probably need a little bit of background here.
</p>
<p>
  A coroutine is a collection of program functionality that
  allows arbitrary branching into other control contexts <em>and</em>
  arbitrary resumption of flow from the branch point.  The
  subroutines familiar in most programming languages are an
  extremely limited sub-case of general coroutines.  A subroutine
  is only entered from a fixed point at the top, and only exits
  once (it cannot be resumed).  As well a subroutine always
  passes flow back to its caller.  In essence, each coroutine
  represents a callable continuation--although adding a new word
  doesn't necessarily clarify things for those who do not know
  it.  An illustration in Randall Hyde's <cite>The Art of Assembly</cite>
  goes a long way towards explaining coroutines:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/CH19A1.gif " alt="Two coroutines in action">
</p>
<p>
  See the Resources for Hyde's general discussion, which is good.
  Despite the negative associations, one can note that the
  infamous <code>goto</code> statment in many languages allows arbitrary
  branching too, albeit in a less structured context that
  promotes "spagetti code."
</p>
<p>
  Python 2.2+'s generators take a big step towards coroutines.
  That is, generators--unlike functions/subroutines--are
  resumable, and can yield values across multiple invocations.
  However, Python generators are only what Donald Knuth describes
  as "semi-coroutines."  A generator is resumable, and can branch
  control elsewhere--but it can only branch control back to its
  immediate caller.  To be precise, a generator context (like any
  context) can itself call other generators or functions--even
  itself recursively--but every eventual return must pass through
  a linear hierarchy of return contexts.  Python generators do
  not allow for the common coroutine usage of "Producers" and
  "Consumers" that freely resume into the middle of each other.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, full-fledged coroutines are quite easy to simulate
  with Python generators.  The simple trick is a <code>scheduler()</code>
  function exactly like that in the above sample code.  In fact,
  the state machine presented is itself a much more general
  coroutine framework pattern.  Adapting to this pattern
  overcomes the minor limitations still present in Python
  generators (and gives incautious programmers the full power of
  spagetti code).
</p>
<h3>Stategen In Action</h3>
 <p>
  To see exactly what is going on in <code>stategen_test.py</code>, the
  easiest thing is to run it:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Running STATEGEN (with manual jump control)</h4><pre>
% python stategen_test.py

TWENTIES State:   *26.2   *26.8
Exiting from exit()...

</pre></div><p>
  This output is basically identical to that from the earlier
  <code>statemachine_test.py</code>.  Each line of the results reprents flow
  spent in one particular state handler or generator; the flow
  context is announced at the beginning of the line.  However,
  rather than simply <strong>call</strong> a handler function again, the
  generator version <strong>resumes</strong> execution (within a loop) whenever
  another coroutine branches into it.  Given that the bodies of
  all the <code>get_*()</code> coroutines are all contained in infinite
  loops, this difference is less evident.
</p>
<p>
  To see what is fundamentally different in <code>stategen_test.py</code>
  look at what happens in the <code>exit()</code> generator.  On the first
  invocation of the generator-iterator, a jump target is
  collected from the user (which is a simple case of the
  event-driven branching decisions a realistic application might
  utilize).  However, when <code>exit()</code> is invoked a second time, it
  is within a later flow-context in the generator--an exit
  message is displayed, and <code>sys.exit()</code> is called.  The user in
  the sample interaction could have also jumped directly to
  "out_of_range", which would exit without going to another
  "handler" (but it <em>would</em> perform a recursive jump into this
  same generator).
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  As was hinted in the introduction, I expect my coroutine
  version of a state machine to run significantly faster than the
  class-with-callback-handlers version presented earlier.
  Resuming a generator-iterator will be notably efficient.  The
  particular example is so simple as to be hardly worth
  benchmarking, but I welcome readers' feedback on concrete
  results.
</p>
<p>
  But any speedup the "coroutine pattern" I present might achieve
  is shadowed by the startlingly general flow-control it allows.
  A number of readers on the comp.lang.python newsgroup have
  inquired about just how general Python's new generators are.  I
  think the availability of the described framework makes the
  answer "as general as one can want!"  As with most things
  Pythonic, it is usually a lot easier to <em>program</em> the things
  than it is to <em>understand</em> them.  Give my pattern a try; I
  think you will find it useful.

<h3>About The Author</h3>
 <p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/cgi/img_dqm.cgi" alt="Picture of Author">
  David Mertz would like to write, with Nietzsche, that these are
  the musings of an old philologist, but that untruth would
  unmask itself.  But perhaps his (right here gratuitously
  plugged) forthcoming book, <cite>Text Processing in Python</cite>, will
  someday be mistaken for a cybernetic variant of philology.
  David may be reached at mertz@gnosis.cx; his life pored over at
 <a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/.">http://gnosis.cx/publish/.</a>  Suggestions and recommendations on
  this, past, or future, columns are welcomed.
