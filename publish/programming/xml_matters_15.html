<h1>Xml Matters #15: More On Xml In Python</h1>

<blockquote>
    Think of the 4Suite set of Python modules as a "connoisseur's
    choice" of XML tools.  With their range and sophistication,
    4Suite tools give a programmer both a lot of power and a
    steep learning curve.  But for moving beyond the base XML
    capabilities offered by recent versions of Python, 4Suite
    offers useful options.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  In earlier installments of my <cite>Charming Python</cite> column (some
  also featured here in IBM developerWorks' XML Zone), I
  presented the Python XML modules included in standard
  distributions, as well as a few other modules that add some
  useful--but fairly limited--enhancements.  What I left out of
  that discussion was the 800-pound gorilla of Python XML tools.
</p>
<p>
  4Suite itself is only half of the rather grand open source
  project shepherded by Fourthought Corporation (and in large
  part by my fellow dW columnist Uche Ogbuji).  The other part is
  4Suite Server.  If 4Suite is sufficiently rich and myriad that
  it takes a while to figure out what it is all about, 4Suite
  Server practically takes a leap of faith.  In this respect,
  4Suite Server is a lot like another big Python server project,
  Zope.  4Suite Server is a very general backend for storage,
  manipulation, indexing, and interfacing with XML document
  stores; and for integrating XML into existing processes and
  systems in ways that take advantage of the business logic (and
  data formats) already in place.
</p>
<p>
  4Suite Server does a lot--in fact a lot more than this column
  will attempt to look at.  For now, I would just like to take a
  look at 4Suite itself; and even there, only at bits and pieces
  that I find most interesting (and that I hope will be most
  useful to readers).
</p>
<p>
  In part, 4Suite contains enhancements to existing PyXML
  capabilities.  One such enhancement is the (currently beta)
  <code>cDomlette</code> module, that can build a complex DOM tree much
  faster than PyXML's default DOM implementation.  But most of
  what is in 4Suite is a set of tools for more advanced chores
  than those in PyXML itself.  In main, these tools are:
  <code>4XSLT</code>, <code>4XPATH</code>, <code>4ODS</code> and <code>4RDF</code>.  Some words on each below.
</p>
<h3>Getting Started With 4suite</h3>
 <p>
  The first thing to do with 4Suite is to download a distribution
  from its website (see Resources).  As well as the distribution,
  you will want to grab the documentation file named
  <code>4Suite-docs-0_11_1.zip</code> (or a tarball equivalent; until a
  later version appears).  The docs contains overlapping, but
  apparently more complete descriptions of the 4Suite tools than
  does the source archive.  In particular, the documentation
  archive contains two very useful directories called <code>demo</code> and
  <code>demos</code> that offer good guidance to the tools.
</p>
<p>
  Most likely, you will need to obtain an update of the
  underlying PyXML distribution.  The details seem to depend on
  the exact platform and Python version you use, and whether you
  obtain a binary or source version of 4Suite.  But the safest
  approach is probably to download and install the most
  recent PyXML distribution first; then afterwards, install
  4Suite.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have the requisite parts installed, you should have a
  few command-line tools available, and quite a few new modules;
  most of the modules are under the <code>Ft</code> hierarchy, but a few
  updates within the <code>xml</code> hierarchy are also made.
</p>
<h3>A Few Words About Dom</h3>
 <p>
  One thing Python has is a slightly embarrassing richness of DOM
  engines.  Choosing the right one is not necessarily obvious.
  Installing 4Suite adds yet more options.  With 4Suite installed
  you might use any one of the below almost-equivalent imports:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Several ways to get DOM in Python</h4><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.dom <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> minidom as dom1
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.dom <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> pulldom as dom2
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> Ft.Lib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> pDomlette as dom3
&gt;&gt;&gt; <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> Ft.Lib <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> cDomlette as dom4</PRE></div><p>
  The "standard" technique is to use <code>minidom</code> (although
  pre-Python 2.0, this was less clear).  <code>pulldom</code> is built on
  top of <code>minidom</code>, but can selectively build subtrees.  4Suites'
  <code>pDomlette</code> is roughly equivalent to <code>minidom</code>, but some
  API differences might exist.  4Suite tools, moreover, rely on
  <code>pDomlette</code>.  <code>cDomlette</code> was mentioned above, and is a
  potentially much faster way of building a DOM tree (but it is
  beta, and might not be entirely API-compatible with other
  modules).
</p>
<p>
  Confused?  So am I, in truth.  But generally, if you cannot
  assume 4Suite is present, just use the Python standard imports;
  if you are using 4Suite, you will probably use higher level
  modules that take care of importing the DOM they want to have
  available.
</p>
<h3>4xslt</h3>
 <p>
  The 4Suite tool that is most general purpose performs XSLT
  transformations.  <code>4xslt</code> is the command-line version.  Its
  source is worth exhibiting:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>4xslt Python command-line script</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#1111CC>#!/usr/bin/env python</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.xslt <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> _4xslt
_4xslt.XsltCommandLineApp().run()</PRE></div><p>
  These two lines are all you need to perform an XSLT
  transformation; the pattern would be very similar in a CGI or
  other web-server context, or as part of a batch process.  But
  right with the package one gets a command-line tool, much as
  one would with a tool like Sablotron, Saxon or Xalan.  Of
  course, for Python programmers, it is nice to have a tool
  written in Python.
</p>
<p>
  The particular flags available for <code>4xslt</code> can be found by
  passing the <code>--help</code> option.  Mostly they are similar to other
  command-line processors.  Validation is optional, and URLs can
  be specified as arguments.  This lets you perform any
  transformation on any XML document on the internet.  Kind of
  handy.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>4xslt run as a command-line tool</h4><pre>
% 4xslt -i http://gnosis.cx/publish/mertz/chap5.xml
           http://gnosis.cx/publish/mertz/chapter.xsl

</pre></div><p>
  The above should send to STDOUT the exact same HTML document
  that was generated statically by Sablotron, and lives at
  <code>http://gnosis.cx/publish/mertz/chap5.html</code> (discussed in <cite>XML
  Matters</cite> #5, see Resources).
</p>
<p>
  Incorporating 4XSLT transformations into larger Python
  applications is equally easy.  Basically, the programmer just
  needs to pick a stylesheet, then run the transformation on an
  XML document.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Sample Python code-fragment of 4XSLT usage</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.xslt.Processor <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> Processor
proc1,proc2 = Processor(),Processor()
proc1.appendStylesheetUri(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'mime.xsl'</FONT>)
result1 = proc1.runUri(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'message.xml'</FONT>)
proc2.appendStylesheetString(open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'mime.xsl'</FONT>).read())
result2 = proc2.runString(open(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'message.xml'</FONT>).read())
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> result1,result2</PRE></div><p>
  Moreover, since 4XSLT transformations are based on an in-memory
  DOM tree, it is equally simple to apply an XSLT transformation
  to just a particular node of the tree.  Use the <code>Processor()</code>
  method <code>.runNode()</code> if you want to mutate the DOM subtree
  according to the transformation; use <code>.execute()</code> if you only
  want to return the result of the transformation.
</p>
<h3>4xupdate</h3>
 <p>
  Another little command-line tool utility in the 4Suite package
  is called <code>4xupdate</code>.  The XUpdate specification provides an
  analog of an SQL <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>INSERT</code> statement, but for XML
  documents rather than relational databases.  The idea behind
  this specification is to give a lightweight means of making
  small changes to XML documents, without requiring as much
  custom programming as a SAX or DOM approach would require.
  XUpdate instructions are themselves specified in XML, much like
  XSLT is--and XPATH paths are used to identify document
  positions for operations.
</p>
<h3>4xpath</h3>
 <p>
  XPath is a general specification for describing node paths
  within XML documents.  The XPath specification is integral to
  XSLT, but it is also used as part of other XML technologies.
  For example, when I decided to develop an indexer for large XML
  documents in a previous column, XPath was the obvious syntax to
  choose for describing parts of XML documents.
</p>
<p>
  The <em><code>xml.xpath</code></em> module that comes with 4Suite provides a
  wrapper for further programming involving XPath descriptions.
  While XPath per se does not require a DOM framework, in the
  context of 4XPATH, what XPath provides is a set of utilities
  for working with DOM trees.  An XPath description can run
  against a DOM (sub-)tree; a list of node objects matching the
  description is returned.  For example (adapted from a 4Suite
  demo program):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python fragment to process XPath node matches</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.dom.ext.reader <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> PyExpat
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.xpath <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> Evaluate
reader = PyExpat.Reader()
dom = reader.fromString(some_function_to_get_XML())
path_descript = <FONT COLOR=#115511>'/this/that/other'</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>for</B></FONT> node <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> Evaluate(path_descript, dom.documentElement):
    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># do something with each matched node</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  In effect, the above code snippet causes the DOM tree to be
  recursively traversed finding <code>&lt;other&gt;</code> elements who have
  parent <code>&lt;that&gt;</code> and grandparent <code>&lt;this&gt;</code>.  But for a class of
  problems, it is a lot easier just to give an XPath description
  of the nodes we are interested in.
</p>
<h3>4ods</h3>
 <p>
  I will only point in the direction of what ODS does for two
  reasons.  On the one hand, 4ODS is not really XML-specific
  itself; on the other hand, there are too many side issues to
  address in this installment.  Mostly, 4ODS is part of 4Suite
  because 4Suite Server wants it to be available.
</p>
<p>
  What 4ODS does is somewhat similar to what ZODB does.
  Actually, in a way 4ODS is simpler, and it could be compared to
  <em><code>shelve</code></em> or <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> (that is, 4ODS does not include native
  transactional capabilities).  Basically, 4ODS is one of the
  ways you can make Python objects persistent across application
  runs.  While worthwhile--and even difficult in most
  languages--object persistence is handled pretty well by other
  Python tools.  The thing that is different about 4ODS is that
  it specifically implements the ODMG Object Data Standard v,3.0
  (which none of the other tools attempt to do).  Amongst other
  things, the ODMG standard uses the specification of object
  formats in <code>.odl</code> files.  If you want it, the 4ODS allows more
  formal design of persistent objects than does an ad hoc
  approach like <em><code>shelve</code></em> or <em><code>pickle</code></em>.
</p>
<h3>4rdf</h3>
 <p>
  RDF is a way of creating "metadata" about XML documents.  4RDF
  is both a library and a command-line took, <code>4rdf</code>, for working
  with the "Resource Description Framework."  Naturally, RDF
  documents are themselves in XML format.  A good way to get a
  handle on what RDF is about is to read Uche Ogbuji's
  developerWorks columns on the topic (see Resources).
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  The 4Suite library adds a number of high-level capabilities to
  a Python/XML programmer's toolchest.  4XSLT fills a very needed
  gap in native Python XML tools.  Some other 4Suite tools occupy
  more niche positions, but are worth exploring if your
  application falls in that niche.

  Up to date versions of the PyXML distribution can be found at
  the below link.  You will probably need a recent release to use
  the most recent 4Suite version (quite likely more recent than
  your underlying Python version).  Of course, new PyXML's come

  Uche Ogbuji has written several article for IBM developerWorks
