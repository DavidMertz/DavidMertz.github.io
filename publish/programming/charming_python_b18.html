<h1>Charming Python #b18: The Natural Language Toolkit</h1>
<h2>Using Python in Computational Linguistics</h2>

<blockquote>
    The Natural Language Toolkit is a Python library for analyzing and
    otherwise processing collections of textual data, particularly in
    terms of the concepts and techniques developed in academic
    linguistics. Some of these techniques overlap with what goes by the
    name "text processing"--or perhaps to lexing/parsing in computer
    science--but other capabilities for syntactic and even semantic
    analysis are specialized to the more subtle texts and grammars of
    natural languages.
</blockquote>
<h3>What <em><code>NLTK</code></em> Includes</h3>
 <p>
  Your humble writer knows a little bit about a lot of things; but
  despite writing a fair amount about <em>text processing</em> (a book, for
  example), <em>linguistic processing</em> is a relatively novel are for me.
  Forgive me if I stumble through my explanations of the quite
  remarkable Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a wonderful tool for
  teaching, and working in, computational linguistics using Python.
</p>
<p>
  It is natural to think of NLTK as a stacked series of layers that
  build on each other. Readers how are familiar with lexing and parsing
  of artificial languages (like, say, Python) will not have too much of
  a leap to understand the similar--but deeper--layers involved in
  natural language modelling. While NLTK comes with a number of corpora
  that have been pre-processed (often manually) to various degrees,
  conceptually each layer relies on the processing in the adjacent lower
  layer. Tokenization comes first; then words are <em>tagged</em>; then groups
  of words are parsed into grammatical elements, like noun phrases or
  sentences (according to one of several techniques, each with
  advantages and drawbacks); finally sentences or other grammatical
  units can be classified.  Along the way, NLTK gives you the ability to
  generate statistics about occurences of various elements, and draw
  graphs that represent either the processing itself, or statistical
  aggregates in results.
</p>
<p>
  For this first article, I will present some comparatively fleshed out
  examples from the lower-level capabilities, but simply describe
  abstractly most of the higher level capabilities.  If I have the
  opportunity to return to NLTK in a later installment, I will give more
  detailed descriptions of parsing and graphing; for now, let us take
  the first steps past text processing, narrowly construed.
</p>
<h3>Tokenization</h3>
 <p>
  Much of what you can do with NLTK, particularly at its lower levels,
  is not <em>that</em> much different from what you can do with Python's basic
  data structures.  But NLTK provides a set of regularized interfaces
  that are relied on and utilized at higher levels, as well as simply
  providing convenient classes to hold tokenized and tagged texts.
</p>
<p>
  In particular the class <code>nltk.tokenizer.Token</code> is used very widely to
  store annotated segments of text; these annotations can mark a number
  of different features, including: parts-of-speech: subtoken stuctures:
  offsets of a token within a larger text; morphological stems;
  grammatical sentence component; and so on.  In fact, a <code>Token</code> is a
  special kind of dictionary--and is accessed in the fashion of a
  dictionary--so it can contain whatever keys you like.  A few special
  keys are used in NLTK, different ones by the various subpackages.
</p>
<p>
  Let us look briefly at creating a token and breaking it into
  subtokens:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>A first look at the nltk.tokenizer.Token class</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.tokenizer import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = Token(TEXT='This is my first test sentence')
&gt;&gt;&gt; WSTokenizer().tokenize(t, addlocs=True) # break on whitespace
&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['TEXT']
This is my first test sentence
&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['SUBTOKENS']
[&lt;This&gt;@[0:4c], &lt;is&gt;@[5:7c], &lt;my&gt;@[8:10c], &lt;first&gt;@[11:16c],
&lt;test&gt;@[17:21c], &lt;sentence&gt;@[22:30c]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t['foo'] = 'bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
&lt;TEXT='This is my first test sentence', foo='bar',
SUBTOKENS=[&lt;This&gt;@[0:4c], &lt;is&gt;@[5:7c], &lt;my&gt;@[8:10c], &lt;first&gt;@[11:16c],
&lt;test&gt;@[17:21c], &lt;sentence&gt;@[22:30c]]&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['SUBTOKENS'][0]
&lt;This&gt;@[0:4c]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(t['SUBTOKENS'][0])
&lt;class 'nltk.token.SafeToken'&gt;

</pre></div><h3>Probability</h3>
 <p>
  One fairly simple thing you are likely to with linguistic corpora is
  analyze frequencies of various <em>events</em> within them, and make
  probability predictions based on these known frequencies.  NLTK
  supports a variety of techniques for projecting probabilities based on
  raw frequency data; I will not cover those here (see the Probability
  Tutorial mentioned in Resources), but suffice it to say that what you
  are warranted to <em>expect</em> has a slightly fuzzy relationship to what
  you already <em>know</em> (beyond the obvious scaling/normalization).
</p>
<p>
  In essence, there are two types of frequency supported by NLTK:
  histograms and conditional frequencies.  The class
  <code>nltk.probability.FreqDist</code> is used to create histograms, for example,
  a word histogram can be created with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Basic histogram creation with nltk.probability.FreqDist</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.probability import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; article = Token(TEXT=open('cp-b17.txt').read())
&gt;&gt;&gt; WSTokenizer().tokenize(article)
&gt;&gt;&gt; freq = FreqDist()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word in article['SUBTOKENS']:
...     freq.inc(word['TEXT'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; freq.B()
1194
&gt;&gt;&gt; freq.count('Python')
12

</pre></div><p>
  The tutorial discusses creation of histograms on more complex
  features, like "the length of words following words ending in vowels."
  The class <code>nltk.draw.plot.Plot</code> is useful for visualization of
  histograms.  Of course, you can equally analyze frequencies of higher
  level grammatical features, or even of data sets unrelated to NLTK.
</p>
<p>
  Conditional frequencies are perhaps more interesting than plain
  histograms.  A conditional frequency is a kind of two dimensional
  histogram--it gives you one histogram per initial condition, or
  "context."  For example, the tutorial suggests the question of what
  the distribution of word lengths is for each first letter.  We can
  analyze that with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Conditional frequencies: word length per initial letter</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cf = ConditionalFreqDist()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word in article['SUBTOKENS']:
...     cf[word['TEXT'][0]].inc(len(word['TEXT']))
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; init_letters = cf.conditions()
&gt;&gt;&gt; init_letters.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c in init_letters[44:50]:
...     print "Init %s:" % c,
...     for length in range(1,6):
...         print "len %d/%.2f," % (length,cf[c].freq(n)),
...     print
...
Init a: len 1/0.03, len 2/0.03, len 3/0.03, len 4/0.03, len 5/0.03,
Init b: len 1/0.12, len 2/0.12, len 3/0.12, len 4/0.12, len 5/0.12,
Init c: len 1/0.06, len 2/0.06, len 3/0.06, len 4/0.06, len 5/0.06,
Init d: len 1/0.06, len 2/0.06, len 3/0.06, len 4/0.06, len 5/0.06,
Init e: len 1/0.18, len 2/0.18, len 3/0.18, len 4/0.18, len 5/0.18,
Init f: len 1/0.25, len 2/0.25, len 3/0.25, len 4/0.25, len 5/0.25,

</pre></div><p>
  A nice linguistic use of conditional frequencies is to analyze the
  syntagmatic distributions in corpora--for example, given the
  occurrence of a particular word, what words are most likely to come
  next. Grammars provide some constraints here, of course; but the study
  of selection among syntactic options falls within the fields of
  semantics, pragmatics, and register.
</p>
<h3>Stemming</h3>
 <p>
  The class <code>nltk.stemmer.porter.PorterStemmer</code> is a wonderfully handy
  tool to derive grammatical (prefix) stems from English words. This
  capability struck a particular chord for me, having previously created
  a public domain full-text indexed search tool/library in Python
  (covered in this column, see Resources; and used by a moderately large
  number of other projects).
</p>
<p>
  While it is quite useful to be able to search a large collection of
  documents almost instantly for a joint occurrence of a collection of
  exact words (what <code>gnosis.indexer</code> does), for many searching purposes
  a little fuzziness would help.  Perhaps you are not quite sure whether
  the old email you are looking for used the word "complicated,"
  "complications," "complicating," or "complicates," but you remember
  that was one of the general concepts involved (probably with a few
  others to perform a useful search).
</p>
<p>
  NLTK includes an excellent algorithm for word stemming, and lets you
  customize stemming algorithms further to your liking.  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Stemming words for morpohological roots</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.stemmer.porter import PorterStemmer
&gt;&gt;&gt; PorterStemmer().stem_word('complications')
'complic'

</pre></div><p>
  Exactly how you might utilize stemming within <code>gnosis.indexer</code>, a tool
  derived from it, or a wholly different indexing tool, depends on your
  usage scenarios. Fortunately, <code>gnosis.indexer</code> has an open interface
  that is easy to specialize. Do you want an index composed entirely of
  stems? Or do you want to include both full words and stems in the
  index? Are matches on exact words to be ranked higher than matches on
  stems? Do you want to separate stem matches form exact matches in your
  results? I will include some sort of stemming capability in future
  versions of <code>gnosis.indexer</code>, but end users might still want to
  customize differently.
</p>
<p>
  In general, however, adding stemming is very simple: First, derive
  stems from a document by specializing <code>gnosis.indexer.TextSplitter</code>;
  second, when you perform a search (optionally) stem the search terms
  before using them for index lookup, probably by customizing your
  <code>MyIndexer.find()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
  I made a discovery, while playing with the <code>PorterStemmer</code>: the class
  <code>nltk.tokenizer.WSTokenizer</code> really is as bad as NLTK's tutorial
  warns.  It is fine to occupy a conceptual role, but for real-life
  texts, you can do a lot better at identifying what a "word" is.
  Fortunately, <code>gnosis.indexer.TextSplitter</code> is one such more robust
  tokenizer.  For example, :
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Stemming based on poor NLTK tokenization</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.tokenizer import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; article = Token(TEXT=open('cp-b17.txt').read())
&gt;&gt;&gt; WSTokenizer().tokenize(article)
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.probability import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.stemmer.porter import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; stemmer = PorterStemmer()
&gt;&gt;&gt; stems = FreqDist()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word in article['SUBTOKENS']:
...     stemmer.stem(word)
...     stems.inc(word['STEM'].lower())
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems = stems.samples()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems[20:40]
['"generator-bas', '"implement', '"lazili', '"magic"', '"partial',
'"pluggable"', '"primitives"', '"repres', '"secur', '"semi-coroutines."',
'"state', '"understand', '"weightless', '"whatev', '#', '#-----',
'#----------', '#-------------', '#---------------', '#b17:']

</pre></div><p>
  Looking at a few stems, the collection does not look all that useful
  for indexing.  Many are not really words at all, others are compound
  phrases with dashes, and extraneous punctuation makes it in with the
  words.  Let us try it with better tokenization:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Stemming using clever heuristics in tokenization</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; article = TS().text_splitter(open('cp-b17.txt').read())
&gt;&gt;&gt; stems = FreqDist()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word in article:
...     stems.inc(stemmer.stem_word(word.lower()))
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems = stems.samples()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word_stems[60:80]
['bool', 'both', 'boundari', 'brain', 'bring', 'built', 'but', 'byte',
'call', 'can', 'cannot', 'capabl', 'capit', 'carri', 'case', 'cast',
'certain', 'certainli', 'chang', 'charm']

</pre></div><p>
  Here you can see several words that have several possible expansions,
  and all the words look like words, or like morphemes.  Tokenization
  matters a lot for random text collections; in fairness to NLTK, its
  bundled corpora have been packaged for easy and accurate tokenization
  with <code>WSTokenizer()</code>.  For a robust real-world indexer, use robust
  tokenization.
</p>
<h3>Tagging, Chunking And Parsing</h3>
 <p>
  The largest part of NLTK consists of various parsers, of varying
  levels of sophistication.  For the most part, this introduction will
  not explain their details, but I would like to give a first brush at
  what they hope to achive.
</p>
<p>
  As background, remember that tokens are special dictionaries--in
  particular, ones that can contain a key <code>TAG</code> to indicate the
  grammatical role of a word.  NLTK corpora documents often come
  pre-tagged for parts-of-speech; but you can certainly add your own
  tags to untagged documents.
</p>
<p>
  "Chunking" is something like "parsing lite."  That is, chunking is
  based either on existing markup of grammatical components, or is
  something you add manually--or semi-automatically using regular
  expressions and program logic.  But it is not really parsing, properly
  speaking (no production rules as such).  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Chunk parsing/tagging: words and and bigger bits</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.parser.chunk import ChunkedTaggedTokenizer
&gt;&gt;&gt; chunked = "[ the/DT little/JJ cat/NN ] sat/VBD on/IN [ the/DT mat/NN ]"
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = Token(TEXT=chunked)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = ChunkedTaggedTokenizer(chunk_node='NP')
&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence['SUBTOKENS'][0]
(NP: &lt;the/DT&gt; &lt;little/JJ&gt; &lt;cat/NN&gt;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence['SUBTOKENS'][0]['NODE']
'NP'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence['SUBTOKENS'][0]['CHILDREN'][0]
&lt;the/DT&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence['SUBTOKENS'][0]['CHILDREN'][0]['TAG']
'DT'
&gt;&gt;&gt; chunk_structure = TreeToken(NODE='S', CHILDREN=sentence['SUBTOKENS'])
(S:
  (NP: &lt;the/DT&gt; &lt;little/JJ&gt; &lt;cat/NN&gt;)
  &lt;sat/VBD&gt;
  &lt;on/IN&gt;
  (NP: &lt;the/DT&gt; &lt;mat/NN&gt;))

</pre></div><p>
  Chunking, as mentioned, can be done with the class
  <code>nltk.tokenizer.RegexpChunkParser</code> using pseudo-regular-expressions to
  describe series of tags making up a grammatical element, e.g. (from
  tutorial):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Chunking with regular expressions on tags</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rule1 = ChunkRule('&lt;DT&gt;?&lt;JJ.*&gt;*&lt;NN.*&gt;',
...               'Chunk optional det, zero or more adj, and a noun')
&gt;&gt;&gt; chunkparser = RegexpChunkParser([rule1], chunk_node='NP', top_node='S')
&gt;&gt;&gt; chunkparser.parse(sentence)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sent['TREE']
(S: (NP: &lt;the/DT&gt; &lt;little/JJ&gt; &lt;cat/NN&gt;)
  &lt;sat/VBD&gt; &lt;on/IN&gt;
  (NP: &lt;the/DT&gt; &lt;mat/NN&gt;))

</pre></div><p>
  True parsing gets us into a lot of theoretical areas.  For example,
  top-down parsers are guaranteed to find every possible production, but
  can be extremely slow because of frequence (exponention order)
  backtracking.  Shift-reduce parsing is much more efficient, but can
  miss some productions.  In either case, a grammar is declared in a
  manner similar to those created to parse artificial languages.  This
  column has looked at some of those: <code>SimpleParse</code>, <code>mx.TextTools</code>,
  <code>Spark</code>, <code>gnosis.xml.validity</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Even past top-down and shift-reduce parser, NLTK also offers "chart
  parsers" that create partial hypotheses that a given sequence can be
  continued to fulfill a rule.  This approach can be both efficient and
  complete.  A quick (toy) example illustrates:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Defining basic productions for a context-free grammar</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.parser.chart import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; grammar = CFG.parse('''
...    S -&gt; NP VP
...    VP -&gt; V NP | VP PP
...    V -&gt; "saw" | "ate"
...    NP -&gt; "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | NP PP
...    Det -&gt; "a" | "an" | "the" | "my"
...    N -&gt; "dog" | "cat" | "cookie"
...    PP -&gt; P NP
...    P -&gt; "on" | "by" | "with"
...    ''')
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = Token(TEXT='John saw a cat with my cookie')
&gt;&gt;&gt; WSTokenizer().tokenize(sentence)
&gt;&gt;&gt; parser = ChartParser(grammar, BU_STRATEGY, LEAF='TEXT')
&gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_n(sentence)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for tree in sentence['TREES']: print tree
(S:
  (NP: &lt;John&gt;)
  (VP:
    (VP: (V: &lt;saw&gt;) (NP: (Det: &lt;a&gt;) (N: &lt;cat&gt;)))
    (PP: (P: &lt;with&gt;) (NP: (Det: &lt;my&gt;) (N: &lt;cookie&gt;)))))
(S:
  (NP: &lt;John&gt;)
  (VP:
    (V: &lt;saw&gt;)
    (NP:
      (NP: (Det: &lt;a&gt;) (N: &lt;cat&gt;))
      (PP: (P: &lt;with&gt;) (NP: (Det: &lt;my&gt;) (N: &lt;cookie&gt;))))))

</pre></div><p>
  A probabilistic context free grammar (or PCFG) is a context free
  grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions.
  Again, parsers for probabilistic parsing are also bundled with NLTK.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  There are important features of NLTK this brief introduction could not
  get to.  For example, NLTK has a whole framework for text
  classification using statistical techniques like "naive Bayesian" and
  "maximum entropy" models.  Heady stuff that I cannot yet explain,
  even if I had space.  But I think even NLTK's lower layers make it
  look like a useful framework for both pedagogical and practical
  applications.
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
 <p>
  The Natural Language Toolking is hosted by Sourceforge, and both its
  home page and associated documentation, downloads, and various other
  resources can be found there.  The home page itself is at:
</p>
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/index.html">http://nltk.sourceforge.net/index.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The documentation for NLTK is rooted at:
</p>
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/index.html">http://nltk.sourceforge.net/index.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  From there you can find API reference guides to several versions of
  the library.  At the time I wrote this, 1.3 was stable, and 1.4 was in
  alpha; but when you read it, most likely later versions will exist.
</p>
<p>
  Of particular use to the new user of NLTK--including me, as I wrote
  this article--are the series of tutorials at:
</p>
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/tutorial/index.html">http://nltk.sourceforge.net/tutorial/index.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Nine tutorials (as of this writing) generally cover respective
  subpackages of NLTK; three supplementary tutorials introduce Python
  more generally for linguistics students who may not already know the
  language (or for other folks). These tutorials are helpful and well
  written, but occasional details seem not to match the most current API
  version.
