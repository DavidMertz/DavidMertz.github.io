    When not to use heavyweight XML APIs. Standard XML APIs like
    SAX, DOM, and XSLT provide sophisticated ways of transforming
    and manipulating XML documents.  But each of them is also
    complex enough to warrant multi-hundred page specification
    documents, and myriad 3rd party books.  For easy tasks, there
    are easier way to get the XML work done.  This tip provides
    links to a number of lightweight XML libraries, and pointers
    on when programmers should use them.
</blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  XML is meant to be easy.  The promise of XML is to provide a
  simple, direct, and universal means of exchanging data between
  various platforms and programming languages.  Unfortunately,
  the most common APIs that have sprung up for manipulating XML
  are anything but simple--they each have multi-hundred page
  specification documents, and require a steep learning curve.
  Admittedly, XML itself has also become a bit more complicated
  than its initial promise.  There ought to be an easier
  way--and, in point of fact, there are a number of easier ways.
</p>
<p>
  Internally, most of the lightweight APIs this tip points out
  are built as higher-level wrappers around SAX(-like) libraries.
  To use the high-level APIs, a programmer need not know much
  anything about the underlying parsers.  In one respect or
  another, simplified APIs just present something easy for an XML
  programmer to deal with.
</p>
<p>
  There are two general approaches to lightweight XML libraries.
  One approach transforms XML into a line-oriented format that
  familiar tools like <code>wc</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>grep</code>,
  <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and in a more sophisticated way <code>perl</code> and other
  scripting languages are accustomed to dealing with.  Another
  approach is libraries that represent XML documents according to
  the "native" data structures of a given programming language.
  Such libraries exist for a number of programming languages, and
  are also generally simpler (and more intuitive to programmers
  of a given language) to invoke than are DOM, XSLT or SAX.
</p>
<h3>Line-oriented Xml</h3>
 <p>
  The PYX format is a line-oriented representation of XML
  documents.  PYX is not itself XML, but it is able to represent
  the information within an XML document.  Moreover, PYX
  documents can themselves be transformed back into XML as
  needed.  In PYX, the first character on each line identifies
  the content-type of the line.  The prefix characters are:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>PYX prefix characters</h4><pre>
(  start-tag
)  end-tag
A  attribute
-  character data
?  processing instruction

</pre></div><p>
  The motivation for PYX is the wide usage, convenience, and
  familiarity of line-oriented text processing tools and
  techniques.  These types of tools both generally expect
  newline-delimited records and rely on regular expression
  patterns to identify parts of texts--good matches for PYX, but
  not for XML.
</p>
<p>
  PYX libraries exist for several programming languages, but much
  of the time it is most useful simply to use the command line
  tools <code>xmln</code> (non-validating) and <code>xmlv</code> (validating).
</p>
<p>
  The PYX format, in contrast to the XML format, allows one to
  easily pose a variety of ad hoc questions about a document.
  For example:  what are all the attribute values in the sample
  document?  Using PYX, we can simply ask:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An ad hoc query using PYX format</h4><pre>
[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml | grep "^A" | awk '{print $2}'

</pre></div><p>
  Or another, let us try to dump the non-empty content lines of
  an XML document:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>An ad hoc query using PYX format (contents)</h4><pre>
[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml | grep '^-[^\n ]' | sed s/^-//

</pre></div><p>
  One could do write custom applications do do these things with
  SAX or DOM, but queries like this really <em>deserve</em> to be
  one-liners.
</p>
<h3>Going Native</h3>
 <p>
  The API methods of DOM give one access to a certain
  data-structure that represents an XML document.  The problem is
  that this data-structure is very little like the built-in data
  types of programming languages.  A number of libraries have
  made the move to "native" versions of XML documents.
</p>
<h3>Python's <code>xml_objectify</code>
</h3>
 <p>
  When my own Python module <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> is used to read in an
  XML document, what one gets is a very simple Python object,
  whose object attributes correspond to the subelements and
  attributes of the root document element.  The only difference
  between subelements and tag attributes is whether they contain
  futher objects or plain text.  Testing the type of thing a
  (Python) attribute contains is sufficient for determining
  whether it started out as a subelement or XML attribute.
</p>
<p>
  Remember first how one might use DOM to look at data in an XML
  document:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Python DOM access to XML data structures</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>from</B></FONT> xml.dom <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> minidom
dom = minidom.parse(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'test.xml'</FONT>)
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'flavor='</FONT>+dom.childNodes[1]._attrs[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'flavor'</FONT>].nodeValue
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>print</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR=#115511>'PCDATA='</FONT>+dom.childNodes[1].childNodes[5].childNodes[0].nodeValue</PRE></div><p>
  In contrast, <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> lets a user refer to the XML
  document data in much more intuitive, and Pythonic, ways:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>[xml_objectify] access to XML data structures</h4><pre>
from xml_objectify import XML_Objectify
py_obj = XML_Objectify('test.xml').make_instance()
print 'flavor=' + py_obj.flavor
print 'PCDATA=' + py_obj.MoreSpam.PCDATA

</pre></div><h3>Ruby's <code>REXML</code>
</h3>
 <p>
  The <em><code>REXML</code></em> library is a library for the Ruby programming
  language that operates in multiple modes.  The stream parser
  works in a way similar to SAX, but with a more Ruby-oriented
  syntax. The tree mode is the most interesting.  Basically, this
  mode is quite similar to the data representation one gets with
  <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> or Perl's <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em> "Tree" style.  One
  advantage the <em><code>REXML</code></em> library has is its integration of an
  XPATH-like region specifier syntax.  For example, the REXML
  tutorial shows these lines:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>REXML tree mode parsing and data structure</h4><pre>
require "rexml/document"
include REXML    # don't have to prefix everything with REXML::
doc = Document.new File.new("mydoc.xml")
doc.elements.each("inventory/section")
    { |element| puts element.attributes["name"] }
    # -&gt; health
    # -&gt; food

</pre></div><h3>Java's <code>JDOM</code>
</h3>
 <p>
  Java gets in the native game also.  Even though DOM was itself
  largely styled around Java, the programming language neutral
  methods of DOM are still unnecessarily complex to work with
  (even in Java).  JDOM is a more Java-native version of XML
  processing.  Let's just look at the JDOM mission statement to
  make the point:
</p>
<blockquote>
    There is no compelling reason for a Java API to manipulate XML to
    be complex, tricky, unintuitive, or a pain in the neck.  JDOM
    is both Java-centric and Java-optimized.  It behaves like Java,
    it uses Java collections, it is completely natural API for
    current Java developers, and it provides a low-cost entry point
    for using XML.
</blockquote>
<h3>Perl's TMTOWTDI
</h3>
 <p>
  In the culture of the Perl programming language, there is a
  motto held by programmers:  "there's more than one way to do
  it."  This slogan is well enough known that it is usually just
  abbreviated as TMTOWTDI.  As one would expect from this motto,
  Perl developers have come up with quite a few different ways of
  handling XML.  While there <em>do</em> exist Perl modules to support
  standards like DOM and SAX, most Perl programmers prefer
  modules that embody the Perlish cardinal virtues:  laziness,
  hubris, and impatience.  Perl programmers are the types of
  folks who think they can do it better, faster, and with less
  work than conformance with rigid and complex standards allow.
</p>
<p>
  In keeping with the style in other presented programming
  languages, both <em><code>XML::Grove</code></em> and <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em> in tree style
  parse XML documents into very Perlish native data structures.
</p>
<h3>Haskell's <code>HaXml</code>
</h3>
 <p>
  <em><code>HaXml</code></em> is a lot like Haskell itself.  It is not necessarily
  simple, but it is striking in its elagance.  <em><code>HaXml</code></em> does a
  good job of bringing a function programming style to XML
  manipulation.  As with the other modules discussed, <em><code>HaXml</code></em>
  makes XML documents look a lot like native data structures.
</p>
<p>
  A quick example shows how one can do an XSLT-like
  transformation to HTML:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>HaXml program to output an I Ching HTML Table</h4><pre>
module Main where
import XmlLib
main = processXmlWith (hexagrams `o` tag "IChing")
hexagrams =
    html [
      hhead [htitle [keep /&gt; tag "title" /&gt; txt] ],
      hbody [htableBorder [rows `o` children `with` tag "hexagram"] ]
    ]
htableBorder = mkElemAttr "TABLE" [("BORDER",("1"!))]
rows f = hrow [hcol [num], hcol [nam], hcol [jdg]] f
         where num = keep /&gt; tag "number" /&gt; txt
               nam = keep /&gt; tag "name" /&gt; txt
               jdg = keep /&gt; tag "judgement" /&gt; txt

 <p>
  Everything one really <em>needs</em> to know about XML is in the
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 W3C Recommendation.  Of
  course understanding exactly what this signifies requires some
  subtlety:
