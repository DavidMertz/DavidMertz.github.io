charming_python_1.txt-  There must be some enthymetic necessity to David Mertz writing

charming_python_1.txt-  he imbibed as a teenager, he wound up with graduate degrees in
charming_python_1.txt-  philosophy.  Now that he writes computer programs for a
charming_python_1.txt-  living--and writes about writing computer programs--a certain
charming_python_1.txt-  symmetry is served by writing such in and about Python.  David

charming_python_2.txt-  <strong>about</strong> quite different matters.  Roads come together.  The

charming_python_2.txt-  comparison to most other programming languages it is both
charming_python_2.txt-  aposiopetic and aphaeretic.  You can just write what you mean
charming_python_2.txt-  without the language making extra demands of your fingers.
