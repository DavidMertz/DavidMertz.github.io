<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  </strong> Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  <strong> Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  </strong> Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  <strong> Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  </strong> Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Domain Name System", the third of seven tutorials covering
  intermediate network administration on Linux. In this tutorial, we
  discuss how to use Linux as a DNS server, chiefly using BIND 9, with
  minor discussion of other utilities.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About DNS
</h3>
 <p>
  The Domain Name System, very usefully, allows users of TCP/IP
  applications to refer to servers by symbolic name rather than by
  numeric IP address. The Berkley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software
  provides a server daemon called <code>named</code> that answers requests for
  information about the IP address assigned to a symbolic name (or a
  reverse lookup, or other information). On the client side of the DNS
  system, applications a <em>resolver</em> is a set of libraries that
  applications may utilize to communicating with DNS servers.  The BIND
  package comes with several client utilities to assist in configuring,
  querying, and debugging a BIND 9 server: <code>dig</code>, <code>nslookup</code>, <code>host</code>,
  <code>rndc</code> (formerly <code>ndc</code>); in essence, these utilities call the same
  libraries as other client applications do, but provide direct feedback
  on answers provided by DNS servers.
</p>
<h3>About BIND
</h3>
 <p>
  As of this writing, the current version of BIND is 9.3.1.  The first
  stable version of the BIND9 series was released in October 2000.  You
  may find BIND8, which is still maintained for security patches
  (currently at 8.4.6) on some older installations.  But as a rule,
  upgrade to BIND9 whenever possible.   Truly ancient systems might
  have BIND4 installed on them, but you should upgrade those as soon as
  possible since BIND4 is deprecated.
</p>
<p>
  All version of BIND may be obtained from the Internet Systems
  Consortium at: &lt<a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/&gt;.">http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/&gt;.</a>  You may also
  find documentation and other resources on BIND at that site.
</p>
<h3>Other resources
</h3>
 <p>
  As with most Linux tools, it is always useful to examine the manpages
  for any utilities discussed. Versions and switches might change
  between utility or kernel version, or with different Linux
  distributions. For more in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
 <a href="http://www.tldp.org/.">http://www.tldp.org/.</a>  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's <cite>TCP/IP Network
  Administration</cite>, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).
</p>
<p>
  For DNS and BIND information specifically, O'Reilly's <cite>DNS and BIND</cite>,
  Fourth Edition (Paperback) by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu, is a good
  resource.  Several other books on BIND are avaialable from various
  publishers.  This tutorial, of course, cannot cover as much detail as
  that 622 page book.
</p>
<h3>Understanding Domain Name System Queries</h3>
 <h3>The topology of DNS
</h3>
 <p>
  DNS is a hierarchical system of domain <em>zones</em>. Each zone provides a
  limited set of answers about domain name mappings: those within its
  own subdomain. A given server will query up to a more general server
  when it does not know a mapping, and if necessary, follow redirect
  suggestions until it finds the correct answer (or determines that no
  answer can be found, producing an error). When a local <code>named</code> server
  finds the answer to a DNS query, it caches that answer for a
  configurable amount of time (typically on the order of hours, rather
  than seconds or days).  By caching DNS queries, the overall network
  demand is lowered considerably, especially on top level domain (TLD)
  servers.  The article on DNS at Wikipedia,
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System,</a> is an excellent
  starting point for understanding the overall architecture.  This
  tutorial borrows a public domain diagram from that site.
</p>
<p>
  An diagram of a hypothetical DNS query makes it easy to understand the
  overall lookup process. Suppose your local machine wishes to contact
  the symbolic domain name <code>www.wikipedia.org</code>. To find the
  corresponding IP address, your machine would first consult the local
  nameserver you have configured for a client machine. This "local"
  nameserve may run on the same machine as the client application; or it
  may run on a DNS server on your local LAN; or may be provided by your
  ISP. In almost all cases, it is an instance of BIND's <code>named</code>. This
  "local" nameserver will first check its cache, but assuming no cached
  information is available, will perform steps like in the below
  diagram:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/Recursive_DNS.gif" alt="An example of DNS recursion">
</p>
<p>
  Understand for this diagram that the "DNS Recurser" is the actual DNS
  server (<code>named</code>), not the client application that talk to it.
</p>
<p>
  DNS uses TCP and UDP on port 53 to serve requests. Almost all DNS
  queries consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a
  single UDP reply from the server.
</p>
<h3>How an application knows where to find a DNS server
</h3>
 <p>
  Configuring client application access to its DNS server(s) is quite
  straightforward. The entire configuration is contained in the file
  <code>/etc/resolve.conf</code>, whose job is principally to specify the IP
  addresses for one or main "local" DNS servers. You may manually
  configure <code>/etc/resolve.conf</code> with known DNS servers; however, if you
  use DHCP to configure a client the DHCP handshaking process will add
  this information to <code>/etc/resolve.conf</code> automatically (you may still
  read it, or even modify it, after DHCP sets it up; but it will be
  reset on reboot).  The library code modified by <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is
  called the "DNS resolver".
</p>
<p>
  If more than one DNS server is configured in an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>
  file, secondary and tertiary DNS servers will be consulted if the
  primary server fails to provide an answer within the specified timeout
  period.  A maximum of three DNS servers may be configured.
</p>
<p>
  The basic entry within an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file are the <code>nameserver
  &lt;IP-addr&gt;</code> entries.   Some other entries let you modify returned
  answers.  For example, the directives <code>domain</code> and <code>search</code> let you
  expand names without dots in them (e.g. machines on the local LAN).
  The <code>options</code> directive' lets you change timeouts per DNS server, turn
  on debugging, decide when to append full domain names, and change
  other aspects of DNS resolver behavior.  For example, one of my
  machines is configued with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># cat /etc/resolv.conf
search gnosis.lan
nameserver 0.0.0.0
nameserver 192.168.2.1
nameserver 151.203.0.84
options timeout:3

</pre></div><p>
  The first directive lets this machine know that machines on the local
  LAN use the private domain <code>gnosis.lan</code>, so the simple name <code>bacchus</code>
  may be resolved as <code>bacchus.gnosis.lan</code>. More than one space-separated
  domain may be listed in the <code>search</code> directive. Next I list several
  DNS servers to try. The first is the local machine itself, which can
  be referred to either as <code>0.0.0.0</code> or by its official IP address, but
  not with a loopback address. The next <code>nameserver</code> directive lists my
  home-office router that connects my LAN to the internet (and provides
  DHCP and DNS services).  The tertiary nameserver is one provided by my
  ISP.  I also set on option to use a three second timeout on each
  nameserver rather than the default 5 seconds.
</p>
<h3>DNS client utilities
</h3>
 <p>
  BIND9 comes with four main client utilities.  Three of those, <code>dig</code>,
  <code>nslookup</code>, and <code>host</code> perform similar functions, more or less in
  descending order of detailedness.  All three utilities are simply
  command-line utilities to exercise the DNS resolver; what they do is
  essentially what many client applications do internally, these
  utilities simply provide output on the results of lookups on STDOUT.
  The most powerful of the three utilities, <code>dig</code>, also has the most
  options to limit or configure its output.  These utilities are most
  often used to lookup an IP address from a symbolic domain name, but
  you may also perform reverse lookups or other record types other than
  default "A" records.  For example, the command <code>host -t MX gnosis.cx</code>
  will show you mail servers associated with <code>gnosis.cx</code>.  Some examples
  help:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'host' query of google.com</h4><pre>
$ host google.com
google.com has address 72.14.207.99
google.com has address 64.233.187.99


$ host -t MX gnosis.cx
gnosis.cx mail is handled by 10 mail.gnosis.cx.

</pre></div><p>
  For <code>nslookup</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>'nslookup' using default (machine-local) server</h4><pre>
$ nslookup gnosis.cx
Server:         0.0.0.0
Address:        0.0.0.0#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   gnosis.cx
Address: 64.41.64.172

</pre></div><p>
  Or a reverse lookup using <code>dig</code> and specifying a non-default
  nameserver:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ dig @192.168.2.2 -x 64.233.187.99

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.2.4 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @192.168.2.2 -x 64.233.187.99

</pre></div><p>
  The remaining BIND9 utility to keep in mind is <code>rndc</code>. The <code>rndc</code>
  utility controls the operation of a name server. It supersedes the
  <code>ndc</code> utility that was provided in old BIND releases. If rndc is
  invoked with no command line options or arguments, it prints a short
  summary of the supported commands.  See the <code>man</code> page for <code>rndc</code> for
  full information on its use.
</p>
<h3>Running A Name Server</h3>
 <h3>BIND configurations
</h3>
 <p>
  When you run the <code>named</code> daemon to provide a DNS server, you may
  choose from three modes of operation: master, slave, and caching-only.
  The <code>named</code> daemon itself looks in its configuration files to
  determine its operating mode, chiefly <code>/etc/bind/named.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
  In master mode, the <code>named</code> server acts as the authoritative source for
  all information about its zone. Domain information provided by the
  server is loaded from a local disk file that is manually modified or
  updated.  Each DNS zone should have exactly one master server.
</p>
<p>
  In slave mode, the <code>named</code> server transfers its zone information from
  the master server for its zone. Technically, a multi-zone server can
  be master of one zone and slave for another, but more commonly a LAN
  installation will have a single hierarchy between master and slave or
  caching-only servers. A slave mode server transfers complete zone
  information to local files from its master server, so the answers
  provided by a slave server are still considered authoritative.
</p>
<p>
  In caching-only mode, the <code>named</code> server keeps no zone files.  Every
  query relies on some other name server for an initial answer, but to
  minimize bandwidth usage, previous queries are cached by the
  caching-only server.  However, any novel query must be answered by a
  query sent over the network.  Caching-only servers are most common on
  local machines where client applications can often perform a lookup
  without any network traffic.
</p>
<p>
  In the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> configuration given as an example earlier,
  <code>0.0.0.0</code> is a caching-only server,  <code>192.168.2.1</code> is a slave server,
  and <code>151.203.0.84</code> is a master server.  You cannot tell this for
  certain just based on the order or IP addresses used, but the use of
  the local machine pseudo-IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> is suggestive of it
  running a caching-only server.
</p>
<h3>Configuring <code>named.conf</code>
</h3>
 <p>
  There are some standard features that pretty much every
  <code>/etc/bind/named.conf</code> file will have. An initial <code>options</code> directive
  will configure some basic information. After that, several <code>zone</code>
  directives will provide information on how to handle various zone
  requests. Domains given in <code>zone</code> directives as IP address represent
  intial portions of IP address ranges, but are indicated "backwards".
  Symbolic names may define zones too, allowing further specified
  subdomains.
</p>
<p>
  A <code>named.conf</code> file (and other BIND configuration files) follow
  somewhat C-like formatting conventions. Both C-style block comments
  (<code>/<strong> comment </strong>/</code>) and C++-style line comments (<code>// comment</code>) are
  allowed; as are shell-style line comments (<code># comment</code>). Directives
  are followed by semi-colon devided statements surrounded by
  curly-brackets. As a start, let us see some common options. My local
  <code>/etc/bind/named.conf</code> begins with:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>include "/etc/bind/named.conf.options";

</pre></div><p>
  But you may equally use the <code>options</code> directive directly:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Configuring 'named.conf' options</h4><pre>
options {
    directory "/var/bind";
    forwarders { 192.168.2.1; 192.168.3.1};
    // forward only;
}

</pre></div><p>
  This setup lets files specified without a full path be located in a
  relative <code>directory</code>; it also tells the local <code>named</code> to look first in
  <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.3.1</code> for non-cached results; the <code>forward
  only</code> directive (commented out here) says to only look in those
  nameservers on the local LAN, rather than ask the root servers on the
  internet.
</p>
<p>
  A special <code>zone</code> directive is present in nearly all <code>named.conf</code>
  files:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Hint zone for root servers</h4><pre>
zone "." {
    type hint;
    file "/etc/bind/db.root";
};

</pre></div><p>
  The contents of <code>db.root</code> (sometimes called <code>named.ca</code> for "certifying
  authority") is special.  It points to canonical root servers, the
  domain registars themselves.  There values change rarely, but you
  may obtain an official latest version from <code>ftp.rs.internic.net</code>.
  This is not a file a regular administrator will modify.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the root zone hint, a <code>named.conf</code> file will contain some
  master and/or slave zones.  For example, for the local loopback:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Loopback zone configuration</h4><pre>
zone "127.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.127";
};

</pre></div><p>
  More interestingly, a <code>named</code> server might act as master for a domain
  (and provide reverse lookup):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>External zone configuration</h4><pre>
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "example.com.hosts";  // file relative to /var/bind
};
// Reverse lookup for 64.41.* IP addresses (backward IP address)
zone "41.64.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "41.64.rev";
};

</pre></div><p>
  For a slave configuration, you might instead use:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>External zone configuration (slave)</h4><pre>
zone "example.com" {
    type slave;
    file "example.com.hosts";  // file relative to /var/bind
    masters { 192.168.2.1; };
};
// Reverse lookup for 64.41.* IP addresses (backward IP address)
zone "41.64.in-addr.arpa" {
    type slave;
    file "41.64.rev";
    masters { 192.168.2.1; };
};

</pre></div><h3>Other configuration files
</h3>
 <p>
   The <code>named.conf</code> file references a number of other configuration
   files with the <code>file</code> directive. These names are dependent on your
   specific setup, but in general will contain various resource records,
   that are defined in RFC 1033 ("Domain Adminstrators Operations
   Guide").  The standard resource records are:
</p>
<p>
     SOA:   "Start of authority".  Paramaters affecting an entire zone.
     NS:    "Nameserver". A domains name server.
     A:     "Address". Hostname to IP address.
     PTR:   "Pointer". IP address to hostname.
     MX:    "Mail exchange". Where to deliver mail for a domain.
     CNAME: "Canonical name". Hostname alias.
     TXT:   "Text". Stores arbitrary values.
</p>
<p>
  The format of a record is:
</p>
<blockquote>
    &lt;name&gt; &lt;time-to-live&gt; IN &lt;type&gt; &lt;data&gt;
</blockquote>
<p>
  The name and time-to-live are optional, and default to the last values
  used.  The literal string "IN" means internet, and is always used in
  practice.  The resource record files may also contain directives which
  begin with a dollar sign.  The most common of these is probably <code>$TTL</code>
  which sets a default time-to-live.  For example, a somewhat trivial
  record file for the <code>127.*</code> localhost looks like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># cat /etc/bind/db.127
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     localhost. root.localhost. (
                              1         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@       IN      NS      localhost.
1.0.0   IN      PTR     localhost.

</pre></div><p>
  Other directives are <code>$ORIGIN</code> which set the domain name used to
  complete any relative domain name; <code>$INCLUDE</code> reads an external file;
  <code>$GENERATE</code> creates a series of resource records covering a range of
  IP addresses.
</p>
<h3>Reverse zone files
</h3>
 <p>
  Reverse zone files (often indicated with a <code>.rev</code> extension) contain
  mappings from zone-specific IP address to symbolic names.  For
  example, we might have a file <code>/var/bind/41.64.rev</code> that contains:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Reverse zone file for 64.41.*</h4><pre>
$TTL 86400
; IP address to hostname
@       IN      SOA     example.com.  mail.example.com. (
                              2001061401   ; Serial
                              21600        ; Refresh
                              1800         ; Retry
                              604800       ; Expire
                              900 )        ; Negative cach TTL

                IN      NS    ns1.example.com.
                IN      NS    ns2.example.com.
; Define names for 64.41.2.1, 64.41.2.2, etc.
1.2             IN      PTR   foo.example.com.
2.2             IN      PTR   bar.example.com.
3.2             IN      PTR   baz.example.com.

</pre></div><h3>Forward zone files
</h3>
 <p>
  Forward zone files (often named as <code>domain.hosts</code>) contain the crucial
  <code>A</code> records for mapping symbolic names to IP address.  For example, we
  might have a file <code>/var/bind/example.com.hosts</code> that contains:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Forward zone file for example.com</h4><pre>
$TTL 86400
; Hostname to IP address
@       IN      SOA     example.com.  mail.example.com. (
                              2001061401   ; Serial
                              21600        ; Refresh
                              1800         ; Retry
                              604800       ; Expire
                              900 )        ; Negative cach TTL

                IN      NS    ns1.example.com.
                IN      NS    ns2.example.com.
localhost       IN      A     127.0.0.1
foo             IN      A     64.41.2.1
www             IN      CNAME foo.example.com
bar             IN      A     64.41.2.2
bar             IN      A     64.41.2.3
