    The Python Enterprise Application Kit (PEAK) is a Python framework
    for rapidly developing and reusing application components. While
    Python itself is already a very-high-level language, PEAK provides
    even higher abstractions. One fairly recent capability added to PEAK
    is the capability to create <em>generic functions</em>, and specifically to
    dispatch them on predicates, not simply on type. Sounds mysterious?
    Read on.

<h3>The Labyrinthine Mind Of Phillip J Eby</h3>
 <p>
  The easiest way to describe PEAK is as "whatever wild ideas Phillip J.
  Eby has studied most recently."  Despite the tone, I am only half
  joking in that characterization.  While PEAK attracts about as many
  contributors as other Free Software Python projects of moderate size,
  at heart the direction of PEAK is driven by the evolving goals and
  interests of its original creator.
</p>
<p>
  The obvious consequence of PEAK following evolving interest is that it
  will probably be somewhat "experimental" for the forseeable future.
  That said, do not worry too much about the issue--every version of
  PEAK I have tried has been stable, and has provided concretely useful
  features.  Moreover, you can now obtain an automatically updated
  tarball of the latest PEAK snapshot, complete with a friendly
  <em><code>disutils</code></em> installation script, with little fuss (see Resources)
</p>
<p>
  In the year since I last looked at PEAK, the most interesting new idea
  introduced in PEAK is <em>generic functions</em>. This article will look at
  this capability, even though it forms just one corner of PEAK as a
  whole. Still, given the natural association of this idea with my own
  multiple dispatch module, <em><code>multimethods</code></em>, I am excited to look at
  PEAK's extensions to dispatch styles. But before proceeding to the
  discussion of generic functions, it is worth glancing at the diagram
  of the components of PEAK given on the PEAK Wiki front page (check
  that page for latest status, see Resources).

<h3>Predicative Dispatch</h3>
 <p>
  A quick note: the term "predicate dispatch" is used more often than
  "predicative" despite being less grammatically accurate. If you do a
  web or library search, try the shorter version.
</p>
<h3>Type-Based Dispatch
</h3>
 <p>
  Readers who read my earlier installment on the Gnosis Utilities module
  <code>gnosis.magic.multimethods</code> have had an introduction to the idea of
  multiple dispatch. In recap, most OOP programming is single dispatch;
  that is, just one designated object determines which code path is
  taken. In a call like <code>foo.doIt(other,args,here))</code> the class of
  argument before the dot--say <code>Foo</code>--determines which code is run; the
  types of <code>other</code>, etc. might be tested in <code>if</code> blocks of <code>Foo.doIt()</code>
  but are not directly involved in code dispatch.
</p>
<p>
  Conceptually, a more general technique is to allow all of the
  arguments to a function/method to determine its specialization in
  equal measure. Under a multiple dispatch system, a generic function
  like <code>doIt()</code> can be specialized to handle various type signatures, of
  various specificity. In the <code>gnosis.magic.multimethods()</code> API this
  might look like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Multiple dispatch on type w/ multimethods.py</h4><PRE>doIt.add_rule((Foo1, Other2, int), func1)
doIt.add_rule((Foo2, Other1, str), func2)
doIt.add_rule((Foo1, Other1, float), func3)
doIt(foo, other, args)  <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># 'foo' is just one co-equal specializer</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  PEAK's module <em><code>dispatch</code></em> also has a type-based dispatcher, but it is
  somewhat trivial currently since it only handles single dispatch--the
  <code>dispatch.on()</code> wrapper gives you exceedingly little beyond normal
  Python class-based dispatch.  Nonetheless, looking at PEAK's
  type-based dispatch warms us up to the syntax for full predicative
  dispatch.  Note here that the examples all take advantage of Python
  2.4's new decorator syntax which is used to modify defined functions
  or methods.  You <em>can</em> use PEAK generic functions with earlier
  versions of Python, but the syntax accomodation is less elegant:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Single dispatch on type w/ PEAK dispatch package</h4><pre>
import dispatch
@dispatch.on('foo')
def doIt(foo, other, args):
    "Base generic function of 'doIt()'"
@doIt.when(int)
def doIt(foo, other, args):
    print "foo is an int |", other, args
@doIt.when(str)
def doIt(foo, other, args):
    print "foo is a str |", other, args
doIt( 1, 'this','that')  # -&gt; foo is an int | this that
doIt('x','this','that')  # -&gt; foo is a str | this that

</pre></div><p>
  It is true enough that <code>dispatch.on()</code> generic function signatures for
  new types can be added without changing the prior code. For example, I
  could add a <code>@doIt.when(float)</code> or <code>@doIt.when(MyClass)</code> to
  the prior code, and later calls would utilize this if relevant. But
  there are a number of ways to accomplish largely the same thing
  without the PEAK <em><code>dispatch</code></em> package.
</p>
<h3>What Is Typing?
</h3>
 <p>
  Types are a funny thing. What most programmers think about when they
  think about variable or object type owes a lot to the vagaries of
  computer CPUs--even among programmers of high level languages like
  Python. The difference between an int, float, and long are not
  compelling distinctions among the numbers themselves, but simply
  accidents of how chip designers have used registers and operands. But
  at a theoretical level the <em>type</em> of integers between 3 and 17 is just
  as sound as the type of integers between <code><em>2^31</code> and <code>2^31-1</code> (the
  latter being what the type <code>int</code> is in Python, on 32-bit machines at
  least). In fact, it makes sense to call <code>IntBetween3And17</code> a -subtype</em>
  of <code>int</code>, at least informally, whether or not the inheritance tree
  matches that.
</p>
<p>
  We can, of course, create our own types in Python by means of the
  <code>class</code> statement, and arrange our types in whatever hierarchies we
  like.  But then, we can also enforce the collection of values that a
  particular class may hold.  The class <code>IntBetween3And17</code> is not too
  difficult to implement in Python; nor is, for example, returning an
  instance of the more general <code>IntBetween0And1000</code> in case you try to
  add 100 to an object of the more restrictive class.
</p>
<p>
  What PEAK's <em><code>dispatch</code></em> module has done--though Eby and other
  contributors may or may not think of it this way--is create a rich
  parametric type system to enhance the relatively meager built-in types
  in raw Python.  However, rather than provide wrappers for creating
  various restricted-membership values of other classes--builtin or user
  defined--[dispatch] provides a way for generic functions to do their
  own fine-tuned "duck typing."  The phrase "duck typing" is often used
  in Python (and Ruby) circles in reference to the expression: "If it
  walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, let's treat it like a duck":
  We do not generally care what an object <em>is</em>. As long as it tastes as
  good as a duck, Python will happily swallow it when in a mood for
  duck.
</p>
<p>
  Let us take a look at our simple <code>doIt()</code> example with a bit of
  parametric typing thrown in:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Predicative dispatch w/ PEAK dispatch package</h4><pre>
import dispatch
@dispatch.generic()
def doIt(foo, other):
    "Base generic function of 'doIt()'"
@doIt.when("isinstance(foo,int) and isinstance(other,str)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is an unrestricted int |", foo, other
@doIt.when("isinstance(foo,str) and isinstance(other,int)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is str, other an int |", foo, other
@doIt.when("isinstance(foo,int) and 3&lt;=foo&lt;=17 and isinstance(other,str)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is between 3 and 17 |", foo, other
@doIt.when("isinstance(foo,int) and 0&lt;=foo&lt;=1000 and isinstance(other,str)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is between 0 and 1000 |", foo, other
doIt( 1, 'this')  # -&gt; foo is between 0 and 1000 | 1 this
doIt('x', 1234)   # -&gt; foo is str, other an int | x 1234
doIt(10, 'this')  # -&gt; foo is between 3 and 17 | 10 this
doIt(20, 'this')  # -&gt; foo is between 0 and 1000 | 20 this
doIt(-7, 'this')  # -&gt; foo is an unrestricted int | -7 this
try: doIt(2222, 66)
except dispatch.interfaces.NoApplicableMethods:
    print "No Applicable Methods" # -&gt; No Applicable Methods

</pre></div><p>
  Notice that the predicates you can specify (as strings) in
  <code>@doIt.when()</code> conditions are exactly the same Python code you might
  use an <code>if</code> block had you written the logic procedurally. However,
  generic functions are much better; generic functions will order
  themselves from more to less specific, so there is no question of
  putting an <code>elif</code> in the wrong place. And perhaps most powerful of
  all, you can add more <code>@doIt.when()</code> conditions in any subsequent
  code, and <code>doIt()</code> will thereafter begin evaluating that new condition
  as a candidate to fulfill a particular call.
</p>
<h3>Avoiding Ambiguity
</h3>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, once you start writing general predicates describing
  the values you would like to handle within a particular function body,
  it becomes easy to create amiguous conditions.  Or at least that is
  exactly what I did quite innocently in trying to write the above
  example.  For example, as a first brush, I naively wrote:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Ambiguous predicates describing 'foo'</h4><pre>
@doIt.when("isinstance(foo,int) and isinstance(other,str)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is an unrestricted int |", foo, other
@doIt.when("3&lt;=foo&lt;=17 and isinstance(other,str)")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is between 3 and 17 |", foo, other

</pre></div><p>
  Each condition is perfectly reasonable in itself.  But then, both are
  equally true for the call <code>doIt(10,"flaz")</code>.  Rather than guess what
  you might have meant, PEAK raises the exception
  <code>dispatch.interfaces.AmbiguousMethod</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Fair enough, we might say.  After all, we really ought to specify
  unique conditions, or at least conditions that can be arranged by
  specificity.  But I can very easily imagine a collection of defined
  predicative generic functions working happily for a long time before
  the ambiguous case is encountered.  PEAK only complains when a
  particular call creates amibiguity, not when the potentially ambiguous
  functions are defined.
</p>
<p>
  Moroever, even though the above example seems easy to catch, it can
  get worse. After all, we are just stating two overlapping conditions
  about <code>foo</code>. But ambiguity need not be restricted to conditions of one
  variable. They can be about multiple variables, and the ambiguity
  might only exist with particular combinations of values. For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Ambiguity in interaction of conditions</h4><pre>
@doIt.when('foo &lt; 10 and bar &lt; 100')
def doIt(foo, bar):
    print "Condition 1 |", foo, bar
@doIt.when('foo &lt; 100 and bar &lt; 10')
def doIt(foo, bar):
   print "Condition 2 |", foo, bar
doIt(50,5)  # -&gt; Condition 2 | 50 5
doIt(5,50)  # -&gt; Condition 1 | 5 50
doIt(5,5)   # -&gt; raises dispatch.interfaces.AmbiguousMethod

</pre></div><p>
  It starts to look, potentially, like difficult program logic to debug.
</p>
<h3>Wrapping Dispatched Functions</h3>
 <p>
  One way to ease the possible pain of predicate ambiguity is by
  breaking down applications of conditions into separate generic
  functions.  PEAK <em><code>dispatch</code></em> gives you a similar ability to explicitly
  dispatch to a <code>next_method</code> as <em><code>gnosis.magic.multimethods</code></em> or CLOS
  has.
</p>
<p>
  We will not go into the details of <code>next_method</code> here; instead, let us
  focus on the more general techniques of wrapping the <em>primary</em> generic
  functions in pre-conditions and/or post-conditions--methods that are
  called before or after a primary function. Moreover, unlike with
  primary conditions, <code>doIt.before()</code> and <code>doIt.after()</code> conditions are
  happy to execute multiple satisfied predicates. This matches our
  concept of a number of pre-conditions we want to make sure of before
  calling the main code.  In case of ambiguity, order of execution is
  essentially arbitrary (it uses the order of definition).
</p>
<p>
  A variation on our little <code>doIt()</code> example makes this more clear:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Dispatching on pre- and post-conditions</h4><pre>
import dispatch
@dispatch.generic()
def doIt(foo, other):
    "Base generic function of 'doIt()'"
@doIt.before("isinstance(foo,int)")
def sayType_int(foo, other):
    print "foo is an int |",
@doIt.before("isinstance(foo,float)")
def sayType_float(foo, other):
    print "foo is a float |",
@doIt.when("3&lt;=foo&lt;=17")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is between 3 and 17 |",
@doIt.when("0&lt;=foo&lt;=1000")
def doIt(foo, other):
    print "foo is between 0 and 1000 |",
@doIt.when(dispatch.strategy.default)
def doNothing(foo, other):
    pass
@doIt.after("True")
def sayValues(foo, other):
    print foo, other
doIt(-17, 'x') # -&gt; foo is an int | -17 x
doIt(1.1, 'x') # -&gt; foo is a float | foo is between 0 and 1000 | 1.1 x
doIt( 9,  'x') # -&gt; foo is an int | foo is between 3 and 17 | 9 x

</pre></div><p>
  If you are able to state invariant pre- and post-conditions, you can
  greatly reduce the danger of ambiguity sneaking in.
</p>
<p>
  There is one more thing to notice in this last example. In prior
  examples, we always used the same <code>doIt()</code> name to define
  specializations of the generic function <code>doIt()</code> However, there is no
  requirement for that naming pattern. Each specialization may be named
  however you like, and descriptive names are a good idea when
  applicable. The generic function itself must be named in the
  decorators to specialization and in the ultimate call that gets
  dispatched. Moreover, specialization functions are perfectly well
  usable outside of the generic framework. For example, if you like, you
  may call <code>sayValues("blah","bloo")</code> by itself; in this case, the
  effect is the same as calling <code>doIt("blah","bloo")</code> (but only because
  neither pre-condition nor primary conditions are satisfied by these
  arguments.
</p>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
 <p>
  Generic functions--especially the wild idea of predicatively
  dispatched functions--can be a little hard to reason about at first.
  But predicative dispatch is a very elegant extension of multiple
  dispatch on (narrow) types alone.
</p>
<p>
  The greatest benefit in PEAK's <em><code>dispatch</code></em> package is the possibility
  it offers for a much more accurate and concise modularization of code.
  Once you define a generic function and a collection of
  specializations, you remain free to add as many additional
  specializations as you want later on--all without so much as touching
  the original (hopefully well-tested) code. For large scale
  collaboration, or simply for applications that are adjusted for a
  family of related versions, this package looks extremely promising.
</p>
<p>
  I have not written about it here, but Phillip J. Eby has put
  considerable work into optimizing this dispatch framework; so you need
  not worry about these powerful facilities significantly impacting the
  speed of your programs that use them.  You just get cleaner code, for
  free.
