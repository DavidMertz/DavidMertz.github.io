    As information grows, effective means of locating information
    become ever more crucial.  This column examines the author's
    public-domain Python <em><code>indexer</code></em> module, with a focus on the
    general field of full-text indexing.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  This column has a somewhat different purpose than my previous
  ones.  Like my readers, I am always trying to learn more, and
  much of the purpose of this column is to invite contributions
  from readers, so that I can include them in future columns (and
  in the discussed project).  I would like this column, in
  general, to reflect the interests and knowledge of my community
  of readers, not simply pronouncements from on high by me.  Let
  us see how it goes.
</p>
<p>
  The project for this column is one that I hope will be useful
  to readers, even in the early version presented.  I have
  developed a full-text indexer in Python, that may be used
  either as a stand-alone utility, or as a module in larger
  projects.  The module is called, creatively enough, <em><code>indexer</code></em>.
  The design of <em><code>indexer</code></em> aims to illustrate principles of
  reusable object-oriented coding.  And the underlying purpose
  brings up many interesting design principles as well (text
  indexing is a quite rich topic, with a surprising number of
  subtleties).  While Knuth has justly warned that "premature
  optimization is the root of all evil," <em>speeding</em> up searches
  over the capabilities of raw text search tools like <code>grep</code>
  is, after all, the point of an index.  So performance issues
  are considered, to a degree, in this column as well.
</p>
<p>
  The module <em><code>indexer</code></em> comes, proximally, from a specific request
  by a colleague for a good way to search a large volume of text
  and HTML help documents.  A nagging concern over the
  usability of years of accumulated mail, news, and writing
  archives provides a distal motivation for <em><code>indexer</code></em>.  What
  <em><code>indexer</code></em> does is quite simple:  it allows one to locate
  (quickly) documents that match search criteria (especially
  where criteria may be difficult or impossible to specify as
  regular expressions).  While a number of commercial and free
  tools exist for similar purposes, many of these are focused on
  the specifics of web-indexing (and require a CGI interface,
  even if through LOCALHOST), are quite complicated to set up and
  use, and only one tool (with a different focus) exists for
  Python.  Of course, some of the older and more complicated
  tools <em>do</em> a lot more in terms of search capabilities.  But
  <em><code>indexer</code></em> has been designed with room to grow into additional
  capabilities.  Nonetheless, even in later versions, I
  anticipate that <em><code>indexer</code></em> will be quite easy to use in
  comparison to other programs.
</p>
<h3>About Search Engines</h3>
 <p>
  What this column calls "full text indexers" is part of the
  slightly broader category "search engines."  For most people,
  a search engine is usually something used to locate URL's on
  the WWW.  Indeed, the WWW is certainly the largest communal
  document store in human history, and by its informal
  organization is probably the set of documents most in need of
  good search engine.  But other document collections--including,
  notably, the files on increasingly large local harddisks--can
  also benefit from search engines to find contents.
  Hierarchical file systems and file-naming conventions are good,
  but they only go so far; sometimes you just need to find a
  document that <em>contains</em> certain information.
</p>
<p>
  Half the problem for internet search engines is <em>locating</em> the
  documents whose contents are to be indexed.  There is no
  algorithm for enumerating every valid URL (although there are
  many heuristics for finding a lot of them).  Fortunately,
  indexing local documents (as <em><code>indexer</code></em> does, for now) makes
  that step easy.  Documents all live in known and enumerable
  locations.  While one might still want to index some directory
  subtrees, but not others, listing of document locations can be
  exhaustive and precise.
</p>
<p>
  There are two rather different approaches one can take to a
  local search engine.  You can perform every search on an ad hoc
  basis against actual file contents at the moment you search, or
  you can create some kind of database of what files contain in
  advance (and search the database rather than the files
  themselves).  The first approach has the advantage of always
  being accurate, and always searching exactly where, and for
  exactly what, you indicate.  In addition, this approach adds
  nothing to storage requirements beyond those for the content
  files themselves.  The <em>big</em> disadvantage of the ad hoc
  approach is that it can be extremely slow, and use a lot of
  computer resources if searching is a common activity.  The
  second approach has the advantage of being <em>far</em> faster, at
  least if implemented well.  Furthemore, in the database
  approach, one search activity can produce summaries of the
  searchable features of documents such that those same documents
  never need to be accessed again for subsequent searches.  This
  makes for <em>much</em> lower cumulative load of a CPU.  On the
  downside, a database can potentially be out of synchronization
  with file contents (reindexing must occur periodically), and it
  will occupy extra space to store (how much space depends
  greatly on the search capabilities and design choices--anywhere
  from 1% to 100% of the size of the original documents might
  well occur).
</p>
<p>
  Some examples of the ad hoc approach are the "File Find"
  function in Windows, the <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> utilities under
  Unix-like operating systems (and <code>kfind</code> under KDE), the
  <code>PMSeek.exe</code> and "Find Object" utilities under OS/2, and the
  "Finder" under MacOS 7.  Database approaches include the "Fast
  Find" utility of MS-Office application, the similar
  "QuickFinder" of Corel-Office, "Sherlock" in MacOS 8+, and in a
  very limited way, the Linux <code>locate</code> utility.  The BeOS "Find"
  is something of a mixture, but it is limited to attibute--not
  full text--search.  Other operating systems have other
  utilities.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to searching, there are many different ways of
  specifying just what contents you are looking for.  All, or
  nearly all, operating systems maintain some metadata on
  documents, such as size, modified date, creation date, and file
  type (sometimes through a "file extension" convention).
  Usually regular file-oriented tools can search for such
  metadata.  Below are some ways of searching actual textual
  contents of files (for files that contain at least <em>some</em> text).
</p>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Regular expression</em> searches match for complex (or less
      complex) patterns that might occur inside files.  These are
      often useful for highly structured data, but usually far
      less useful for identifying textual contents.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Word occurrence rates</em> indicate how frequently a set of
      search words occur within a document.  The presumption here
      is that documents that contain a greater prevalence of
      searched terms are "better" matches for a given search.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Phrase</em> searches are simply searches that allow multi-word
      terms.  Regular expression searches certainly include this
      capability, but so do some simpler systems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Proximity</em> searches look for sets of words or phrases that
      occur "close" to one another.  How close is often a search
      option.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Boolean searches</em> allow complex relations between
      word/phrase occurrences.  For example "(spam AND eggs) OR
      (ham AND cheese)" might match either parenthesized
      conjunction without including words from the other side of
      the disjunction.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Word stems</em> are sometimes used rather than actual words.
      For purposes of searching, it is sometimes nice to consider
      that "run", "runner", "running" and "runs" are related words
      (since you might not be sure which occured in the documents
      you want).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Conceptual</em> searches pay attention to words that are
      similar in meaning (under the assumption that any of them
      might have been used in documents covering similar topics).
      This type requires integrating some sort of thesaurus into
      the search engine.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    * <em>Soundex</em> searches allow for irregular spellings,
      particularly in English.  Rather than look for words as
      spelled, a cannonical pronunciation is indexed for a word,
      and search terms are cannonicalized internally.
</blockquote>
<p>
  No doubt, still other variations are possible, but these are
  the mostly widely used capabilities.
</p>
<h3>About <em><code>indexer</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  The project presented, <em><code>indexer</code></em>, uses a database of word
  occurrences for its searching.  The only search capability
  contained in the version 0.1x alpha is a search for multiple
  words jointly occurring in a document.  However, an algorithm
  is optionally used to rank matched documents based on the
  prevalence of the occurrence of search words (compared to
  document length).  There are some ways <em><code>indexer</code></em> could be
  logically and directly extended, and other ways that would be
  more difficult.
</p>
<p>
  Boolean capability is straightfoward, and is planned.  Since
  <em><code>indexer</code></em> stores a mapping of everywhere each word occurs (and
  how many times per file), adding some logic to rule out or
  include files as matches based on the various search words that
  do and do not occur is easy enough.  In fact, the current
  capability is essentially the same thing as defaulting to an
  AND between every search word.  On the other hand, my own hunch
  is that the large majority of practical searches are precisely
  this "x AND y AND z" type search.
</p>
<p>
  Regular expressions would be nearly impossible to add to
  <em><code>indexer</code></em>, and I know of no database search system that stores
  an abstraction of possible regular expressions.  For practical
  purposes, regular expressions need to be handled on an ad hoc
  basis... and we have <code>grep</code> for just this purpose.
</p>
<p>
  Phrase and proximity searches are not currently performed, but
  the mechanism to perform them would not be all that difficult
  to add.  Basically, along with the number of occurrences of
  each word in each file, we would have to collect a list of
  offsets where the word occurs (per file).  From this, phrases
  and proximity could be deduced backwards.  However, I have a
  feeling that adding this would considerably increase database
  size, and thereby also search time.
</p>
<p>
  Conceptual, word stem, and soundex searches are also possible
  within the current general framework, but with quite a bit of
  work.  These might actually reduce the size of the database
  since only cannonical forms would be stored, not variants; but
  at the cost of requiring considerable external thesauri and
  rule-patterns for transformations of words.
</p>
<h3>How Is <em><code>indexer</code></em> Programmed?</h3>
 <p>
  I encourage readers to download the source for <em><code>indexer</code></em>.  It
  is just one file, and is extensively commented (almost to the
  point of literate programming).  But I'd like to make a few
  remarks on the program structure here, followed by a discussion
  of the biggest outstanding issues for future development.
</p>
<p>
  The general principle of <em><code>indexer</code></em> is simply to keep a Python
  dictionary with words as keys, and values containing nested
  dictionaries of fileid/occurrence pairs).  Python dictionary
  lookups are quite fast and efficient.  A little extra work goes
  into connecting integer fileids with the actual filenames, but
  that is fairly minor (there are a lot more words than there are
  files).
</p>
<p>
  In its main, <em><code>indexer</code></em> contains an <em>abstract</em> class called
  <code>GenericIndexer</code>.  The most important methods defined in
  <code>GenericIndexer</code> are <code>add_files()</code> and <code>find()</code>.  They rely on
  various other methods, but these are the main ones a user of
  the module will call.  The <code>save_index()</code> method might also be
  important, depending on whether the storage mechanism requires
  finalization (most do).
</p>
<p>
  What makes <code>GenericIndexer</code> <em>abstract</em> is that it cannot be
  instantiated itself, only its children that fulfill certain
  further obligations can.  The term "abstract" comes from C++,
  where it can be part of the formal declaration of a class.  In
  Python, no such formal declaration exists; instead, the
  "abstract"ness of a class is simply a matter of a
  recommendation by the class developer to its users.  That's the
  Python way--not to enforce data hiding, member visibility,
  inheritence requirements, and the like, but simply to follow
  polite conventions about when these things should be done
  (sometimes through a few naming conventions, such as initial
  underscores).  However, <code>GenericIndexer</code> does a pretty good job
  of imposing its recommendation, since several of its methods
  consist of the line <code>raise NotImplementedError</code>.  In
  particular, <code>__init__()</code> calls <code>load_index()</code>, which is one of
  those "NotImplemented" methods.  There are many ways to get
  around the limits of <code>GenericIndexer</code>, but the easiest one is
  simply to descend from it, and implement the missing methods
  (which is what is done).
</p>
<p>
  The main job descendents of <code>GenericIndexer</code> perform is the
  actual <strong>storage</strong> of indices.  It would be possible--although
  somewhat pointless--to create a <code>NullIndexer</code> descendent that
  effectively dumped every index to <code>/dev/null</code>, and required new
  indexing at the start of every search.  Partially for the fun
  of it, and partially because of some surprising performance
  results (see the module for benchmarks), I have created a large
  number of instantiable child <code>SomethingIndexer</code> classes.  If
  you like, concrete (the opposite of abstract) classes for
  <em><code>shelve</code></em>, XML, flat-file, <em><code>cPickle</code></em> are available.  But the
  best one for most purposes is <code>ZPickleIndexer</code>, which combines
  <em><code>zlib</code></em> with <em><code>cPickle</code></em>, and stores compressed, pickled
  dictionaries.
</p>
<p>
  As well as providing implementations for <code>load_index()</code> and
  <code>save_index()</code>, concrete <code>SomethingIndexer</code> classes inherit
  from a "mixin class" <code>SomethingSplitter</code>.  At the current time,
  the only such <code>SomethingSplitter</code> is <code>TextSplitter</code>, but others
  are likely later.  A <code>SomethingSplitter</code> provides the very
  important <code>splitter()</code> method, whose job is to take a text
  string, and break it into component words.  It turns out that
  this job is a <strong>lot</strong> more difficult than one might thing
  (certainly than I thought beforehand).  A lot of subtlety goes
  into what <em>is</em> and <em>is not</em> a word.  In ther future, besides
  general version improvements, I expect to create descendent
  classes like <code>XMLSplitter</code>, <code>TeXSplitter</code>, <code>PDFSplitter</code>, and
  the like.  For now, we try to find text words in a moderately
  naive way.
</p>
<p>
  A "mixin class" is an interesting concept, and is often a good
  design choice.  A class like <code>TextSplitter</code> (or its future
  descendents) might contain a bit of functionality that might be
  useful for a number of unrelated descendents.  Like an abstract
  class, a mixin is unlikely to be instantiated directly
  (although this is not as much a matter of prohibition as
  usefulness:  I do not raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> in the
  mixin).  But unlike an abstract class, a mixin does not try to
  contain the framework for an instantiable child.
  <code>TextSplitter.splitter()</code> is basically similar to a global
  utility function (which is how it started out, before
  refactoring), but the OOP-iness of an inherited class gives
  somewhat better control of scoping.
</p>
<h3>Open Problems In <em><code>indexer</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  There are a few specific issues I would like to resolve for
  <em><code>indexer</code></em>.  Ultimately, the problems boil down to peformance
  ones.
</p>
<p>
  In the current design, indexes are stored in a single database
  that is read into memory at startup (<code>ShelveIndexer</code> actually
  uses three 'shelve's, but the WORD one is the only one that
  matters, sizewise).  To read in a 3-4 MB database, find word
  matches, and produce results, takes only about 5 seconds on the
  slower of my test machines (a 333Mhz Linux box w/ 96 MB).  That
  is very reasonable, and still far faster than an ad hoc search
  tool.  However, I get dramatically non-linear performance as
  the database grows.  For a 12 MB database, the read-load-find
  cycles jumps to well over a minute.  That is really
  unacceptable, and is not proportional to the 4x increase in
  database size.  It seems like some sort of cache miss effect in
  behavior, but that does not make sense to me given the actual
  memory of the system.
</p>
<p>
  A fairly simple solution to the large database issue would be
  to break to database into pieces.  For example, separate files
  could be used for each initial letter of indexed words.  Since
  most searches would be on just a few words--hitting no more
  first letters than the number of words--only a subset of to
  pieces would be loaded for a given search.  Even with
  non-uniform distribution of initial letters, this makes for
  dramatically smaller reads.  Of course, a little extra
  processing would be needed to combine dictionaries in memory
  after read of each sub-database; but that should be far less
  significant than the read overhead.
</p>
<p>
  An even better solution to the database-read startup cost would
  be to avoid it altogether.  Using <code>shelve</code> would seem to be a
  way to do this, since it would allow disk files to be used as
  dictionaries without requiring a unified read into memory.
  However, on two test machines <code>dumbdbm</code> and <code>dbhash</code> proved to
  be the installed <code>dbm's, both of which produce <strong>absurdly</strong>
  inflated database sizes (an order of magnitude worse than
  'ZPickleIndexer</code> uses).  I do not like that cost, and do not
  feel that I can count on users installing a better <code>dbm</code> like
  <code>gdbm</code> or <code>bsddb</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The problems with database size boil down to a more fundamental
  problem, however.  Ideally, I would expect the word dictionary
  to behave asymptotically as more files are indexed.  After all,
  at a certain point, it would seem as if all the possible
  words--or at least a majority of them--have been added.
  Unfortunately, this ideal behavior does not seem to occur.
</p>
<p>
  It turns out that it is quite difficult to identify real words,
  and distinguish them from "gibberish."  The set of words
  someone might very reasonably want to search for is far larger
  than a simple English dictionary (documents are written in
  other human languages, for one thing).  Trademarks, usernames,
  URLs, company names, open source projects, and many other
  sources use words that are definitely "words" in the sense
  <em><code>indexer</code></em> wants.  But binary encodings--and especially
  semi-binary encodings like base64 and uuencoding--also
  produces, more-or-less by accident alphanumeric strings also.
  The result is quite a few spurious words when mixed filetypes
  are indexed.  A few heuristics are used by <code>TextSplitter</code> to
  eliminate a quite a bit of "gibberish", but an improvement to
  this class would probably bring indexing much closer to the
  desired asymptotic behavior.  By the way, restricting words to
  alphabetic characters would aid things by a huge amount, but
  there are just too many letter/number combinations that are
  genuine ("P2P", "Win95", "4DOM", and so on) to do this.
  Suggestions are welcomed.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>
  This column has probably only scratched the surface of either
  the <em><code>indexer</code></em> module itself, or the broader topic of full text
  indexing.  As the module improves with time--and especially if
  readers/users contribute suggestions--later columns will
  revisit the module, and more of the theory behind it.
