    The document format called reStructuredText has been adopted
    as (one of) the official source format(s) for Python
    documentation, but is also useful for other types of
    documentation. reStructuredText is an interesting hybrid of
    technologies--in syntax and appearance it is similar to
    other "almost-plaintext" formats, but in semantics and API it
    is very close to XML.   Moreover, existing tools can
    transform reStructuredText into several XML dialects
    (docutils, DocBook, OpenOffice), along with other useful
    formats like LaTeX, HTML, PDF.

<h3>About <em><code>reStructuredText</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  Previous articles I have written for the XML Zone have looked
  at alternatives to XML--document formats that satisfy many of
  the same purposes for which you might use XML. reStructuredText
  continues this tradition. In contrast to YAML, which is good
  for data formats, reStructuredText is designed for documentation;
  in contrast to smart ASCII, reStructuredText is heavier, more
  powerful, and more formally specified. All of these formats, in
  contrast to XML, are easy and natural to read and edit with
  standard text editors.  Working with XML more-or-less requires
  specialized XML editors, such as those I have reviewed
  previously.
</p>
<p>
  reStructuredText--frequently abbreviated as reST--is part of the
  Python Docutils project. The goal of this project is to create a
  set of tools for manipulating plaintext documents, including
  exporting them to structured formats like HTML, XML, and TeX.
  While this project comes from the Python community, the needs it
  addresses extend beyond Python. Programmers and writers of all
  stripes frequently create documents such as READMEs, HOWTOs,
  FAQs, application manuals, and in Python's case PEPs (Python
  Enhancement Proposals). For these types of documents, requiring
  users to deal with verbose and difficult formats like XML or
  LaTeX is not generally reasonable, even if those users are
  programmers. But it is still often desirable to utilize these
  types of documents for purposes beyond simple viewing: i.e.,
  indexing, compilation, pretty-printing, filtering, etc.
</p>
<p>
  For Python programmers, the Docutils tools can satisfy a
  similar purpose to JavaDoc does for Java programmers, or POD
  does for Perl programmers.  The documentation within Python
  modules can be converted to Docutils "document trees", and
  thence to various output formats (usually within a single
  script).  But for this article, the more interesting use is for
  general documentation.  For articles like this, and even for my
  forthcoming book, I write using smart ASCII; but I am coming to
  feel I would be better off with the formality of
  reStructuredText (and I may develop tools to convert my
  existing documents).
</p>
<p>
  As of this writing, the Docutils project is under development,
  and has not released a "stable" version.  The tools that exist
  are good, but the overall project is a mixture of promises,
  good intentions, partial documentation, and some actual
  working tools.  However, progress is steady, and what you can
  do already is very useful.
</p>
<h3>Examples Of <em><code>reStructuredText</code></em></h3>
 <p>
  Readers will get a better sense of what reStructured text is
  about with a brief example.  The following text is an example
  in PEP 287 (of part of a hypothetical PEP):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Plaintext version of PEP</h4><pre>
Abstract

    This PEP proposes adding frungible doodads [1] to the
    core. It extends PEP 9876 [2] via the BCA [3] mechanism.

...

    [2] PEP 9876, Let's Hope We Never Get Here
        http://www.python.org/peps/pep-9876.html

    [3] "Bogus Complexity Addition"

</pre></div><p>
  The format is exactly how PEPs prior to 287 were formatted.  If
  reStructuredText is used to "markup" the same PEP, it could
  look like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>reST version of PEP</h4><pre>
Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding `frungible doodads`_ to the core.
It *extends* PEP 9876 [#pep9876]_ via the BCA [#]_ mechanism.

...

References &amp; Footnotes
======================

.. _frungible doodads: http://www.example.org/

.. [#pep9876] PEP 9876, Let's Hope We Never Get Here

.. [#] "Bogus Complexity Addition"

</pre></div><p>
  There are a few details that differ from the plaintext.  But
  readability is really not harmed by the very light sprinkling
  of special characters.  You would not need to look twice to
  read this if you saw it in a text editor or a printed page.
</p>
<p>
  The above reST formatted document can be automatically
  transformed into an XML dialect, such as that defined by the
  Docutils Generic DTD:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Docutils XML version of PEP</h4><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;document source="test"&gt;
  &lt;section id="abstract" name="abstract"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Abstract&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;paragraph&gt;This PEP proposes adding &lt;reference
      refname="frungible doodads"&gt;Frungible doodads&lt;/reference&gt;
      to the core. It&lt;emphasis&gt;extends&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;reference
      refuri="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-9876.html"&gt;
      PEP 9876&lt;/reference&gt;&lt;footnote_reference auto="1" id="id1"
      refname="pep9876"/&gt; via the BCA &lt;footnote_reference
      auto="1" id="id2"/&gt; mechanism.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph&gt;...&lt;/paragraph&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;section id="references-footnotes"
           name="references &amp;amp; footnotes"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;References &amp;amp; Footnotes&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;target id="frungible-doodads" name="frungible doodads"
            refuri="http://www.example.org/"/&gt;
    &lt;footnote auto="1" id="pep9876" name="pep9876"&gt;
      &lt;paragraph&gt;&lt;reference
        refuri="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-9876.html"&gt;PEP
        9876&lt;/reference&gt;, Let&amp;apos;s Hope We Never Get Here
      &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;/footnote&gt;
    &lt;footnote auto="1" id="id3"&gt;
      &lt;paragraph&gt;&amp;quot;Bogus Complexity Addition&amp;quot;
      &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;/footnote&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/document&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  You can see several things in contrasting these three formats.
  The most dramatic difference is how much harder it is to skim
  the XML version.  But it is also notable just how much
  information the reStructuredText tools have located in the reST
  document.  References of several types are properly matched up,
  document sections are identified, character-level typographic
  markup is added.  In other examples, linked TOCs can be
  generated during processing, along with other special
  directives.
</p>
<h3>The Docutils Project Structure</h3>
 <p>
  The <em><code>docutils</code></em> package consists of quite a few subpackages, in
  a fairly complicated relationship to each other.  PEP 258,
  <cite>Docutils Design Specification</cite>, contains a chart that is
  useful for understanding the overall pattern:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Docutils Project model</h4><pre>
.                +---------------------------+
                 |        Docutils:          |
                 | docutils.core.Publisher,  |
                 | docutils.core.publish_*() |
                 +---------------------------+
                  /            |            \
                 /             |             \
                /              |              \
       +--------+       +-------------+       +--------+
       | READER | ----&gt; | TRANSFORMER | ====&gt; | WRITER |
       +--------+       +-------------+       +--------+
        /     \\                                  |
       /       \\                                 |
      /         \\                                |
+-------+   +--------+                        +--------+
| INPUT |   | PARSER |                        | OUTPUT |
+-------+   +--------+                        +--------+

</pre></div><p>
  A more complete explanation of the component subpackages is
  contained in that PEP, but a brief explanation is worth
  repeating here.
</p>
<p>
  The heavy work of converting a reST text into a tree of nodes
  is done by the <em><code>docutils.parsers.rst</code></em> subpackage.  The
  reStructuredText parser treats a source in a line-oriented
  fashion, looking for a state transition on each line; if none
  of the other transition patterns are found, the <code>text</code>
  transition catches the line.  Transitions consist of features
  like change in indentation, special leading symbols, and so on.
  The default just includes the next line as more text within the
  current node.
</p>
<p>
  This structure is similar to that used in the smart ASCII parsers
  <code>txt2dw</code> and <code>txt2html</code>. Other parsers would live under the
  <em><code>docutils.parsers</code></em> hierarchy, but none are currently provided.
  There is an experimental Python source code parser though, which
  treats a Python source file as a document tree.
</p>
<p>
  Once a tree of nodes is generated for a document, the
  <em><code>docutils.transforms</code></em> subpackage is enlisted to massage the
  tree in various ways.  For example, if you have specified a
  directive to include a table-of-contents, the document tree is
  walked to identify listed items.  Also, some cleanup of
  references and links is performed at this stage.  During the
  initial pass, the places in the tree where unresolved elements
  will go is filled with placeholders that cue the
  transformations.
</p>
<h3>Event-oriented Output</h3>
 <p>
  Of most interest to readers of this article are probably the
  various <em><code>docutils.writers</code></em> modules.  Some of the more
  interesting writers are still kept in the experimental
  "sandbox" area at the time of this writing (check the Docutils
  website), but the principles are the same in any case.  A
  writer module should define a <code>Writer</code> class that inherits from
  <code>docutils.writers.Writer</code>  This <code>Writer</code> class defines some
  settings, but mostly defines a <code>.translate()</code> method, that
  might look something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Typical custom Writer.translate() method</h4><pre>
def translate(self):
    visitor = DocBookTranslator(self.document)
    self.document.walkabout(visitor)
    self.output = visitor.astext()

</pre></div><p>
  The writer, as you can see, depends on a "visitor" that knows
  what to do with nodes of each type. A visitor will generally
  inherit from <code>docutils.nodes.NodeVisitor</code>. Programming a visitor
  is quite a lot like programming a <em><code>SAX</code></em>, <em><code>expat</code></em>, <em><code>REXML</code></em>, or
  other event-oriented XML parser.  However, a visitor is even
  closer to the programming style of Python's <em><code>xmllib</code></em> module.
  That is, a visitor will have a <code>.visit_FOO()</code> and
  <code>.depart_FOO()</code> method for each type of node, rather than
  switching on type within large <code>.startElement()</code> and
  <code>endElement()</code> methods.  OOP purists are likely to prefer this
  style.  An simple example from the Docbook/XML writer is:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>class DocBookTranslator(nodes.NodeVisitor):
    [...lots of methods...]
    def visit_block_quote(self, node):
      self.body.append(self.starttag(node, 'blockquote'))
    def depart_block_quote(self, node):
      self.body.append('&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n')
    [...lots more methods...]

</pre></div><p>
  Programming a custom writer/visitor is a straightforward enough
  matter, and existing writers exist for Docutils/XML, HTML,
  PEP-HTML, PseudoXML (a sort of "light" XML that combines start
  tags with indentation, but no closing tags), LaTeX,
  DocBook/XML, PDF, OpenOffice/XML, and Wiki-HTML.
</p>
<h3>Tree-oriented Processing</h3>
 <p>
  You may transform a reStructuredText document into a tree of
  nodes that can be manipulated in a DOM-like fashion.  The below
  is an example using the prior brief example of a reST PEP.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Creating a reST Node Tree</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; txt = open('pep.txt').read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; def rst2tree(txt):
...     import docutils.parsers.rst
...     parser = docutils.parsers.rst.Parser()
...     document = docutils.utils.new_document("test")
...     document.settings.tab_width = 4
...     document.settings.pep_references = 1
...     document.settings.rfc_references = 1
...     parser.parse(txt, document)
...     return document
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc = rst2tree(txt)
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc.children
[&lt;section "abstract": &lt;title...&gt;&lt;paragraph...&gt;&lt;paragraph...&gt;&gt;,
 &lt;section "references &amp; footnotes": &lt;title...&gt;
   &lt;target "frungible doodads"...&gt;&lt;footnote "pep9 ...&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print doc.autofootnotes
[&lt;footnote "pep9876": &lt;paragraph...&gt;&gt;, &lt;footnote: &lt;paragraph...&gt;&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print doc.autofootnotes[0].rawsource
PEP 9876, Let's Hope We Never Get Here

</pre></div><p>
  One thing to notice in contrast with DOM is that reStructuredText
  is already a fixed document dialect. So rather than use generic
  methods to search for matching nodes, you can search for nodes
  using attributes named for their meaning. The <code>.children</code>
  attribute is generically hierarchical, but most attributes
  collect nodes of a given type.
</p>
<p>
  One convenient method of reST nodes is <code>.pformat()</code>, which
  produces a pseudo-XML representation of the document tree for
  pretty-printing. E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Pseudo-XML representation of reST node</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print doc.autofootnotes[0].pformat('  ')
&lt;footnote auto="1" id="pep9876" name="pep9876"&gt;
  &lt;paragraph&gt;
    &lt;reference refuri="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-9876.html"&gt;
      PEP 9876,
    Let's Hope We Never Get Here

</pre></div><p>
  Node methods like <code>.remove()</code>, <code>.copy()</code>, <code>.append()</code>,
  <code>.insert()</code> are useful for pruning and manipulating trees.
</p>
<p>
  For XML programmer, a possibly more desirable API is actual
  DOM.  Fortunately, this API is a single method call away:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Converting a reST tree to a DOM tree</h4><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; dom = doc.asdom()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foot0 = dom.getElementsByTagName('footnote')[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print foot0.toprettyxml('  ')
&lt;footnote auto="1" id="pep9876" name="pep9876"&gt;
  &lt;paragraph&gt;
    &lt;reference refuri="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-9876.html"&gt;
      PEP 9876
    &lt;/reference&gt;
    , Let's Hope We Never Get Here
  &lt;/paragraph&gt;
&lt;/footnote&gt;

</pre></div><p>
  Unfortunately, as of this writing, there are no tools or
  functions to convert a DOM tree or XML document <em>back</em> into
  reStructuredText.  It would be nice, especially, to have a
  reader for the Docutils Generic DTD; this would let us produce
  a reST document tree for the corresponding XML.  We could write
  it back out as reST with the <code>.astext()</code> node method.  It would
  not be hard to write such a reader, and I am sure it will
  happen over time (perhaps by me or one of my readers).
