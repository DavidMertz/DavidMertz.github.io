WEB ZONE TIP: Pay attention to the CSS @media rule
When to define the 'screen' media type

    The CSS '@media' rule is a useful way to target an HTML or XML
    document to an intended output device. Use of the 'print' media is
    now fairly widespread, and provides a much cleaner means of creating
    print-friendly pages than do separate "printable version". The use
    of the 'screen' media has been somewhat underused, perhaps under an
    inaccurate belief that to screen is merely the "default rendering."
    However, in regard to positioning--especially absolute
    positioning--the screen media type has an important meaning that is
    not covered by media-free stylesheet rules.

INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  At a recent job I encountered a surprisingly difficult to research
  glitch in an AJAX web application I was creating. As in many web
  applications, I wished to create an interface widget in a fixed
  position on the screen. In my case, and in this tip, it was a bar
  across the bottom of an information display. For my real application,
  this bar contained a variety of child widgets to configure and
  interact with the application; for this tip, we will substitute a
  static collection of information.  The CSS problem is not affected by
  the simplification.

  One might go about this interface design by putting elements in a
  '<frame>' or '<iframe>' element. Using frames, however, loses both
  some of the easy RESTfulness of the application and the power of
  client ECMAscript to toggle the visibility of '<div>' elements during
  interaction. The best thing all around would be to have a pure CSS
  description of the interface.

  Let us try it.

A FIRST MISTAKE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For this tip, I created a toy


      Use the '@media screen' CSS rule to enable correct element
    positioning. There's a subtle gotcha in using 'absolute' positioning
    of HTML elements--especially for special or sometimes-hidden <div>
    elements: Elements positioned correctly on initial rendering will
    not stay where they should upon scrolling unless those <div>'s are
    styled within '@media screen' rules. Briefly discuss use of
    media-specific style sheet tags, with example of automatic
    print-friendly page versions.
