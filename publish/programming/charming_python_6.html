    Sometimes you want a full-blown GUI interface in your Python
    program.  And other times a strictly command-line interface
    is the most appropriate usage.  But still another class of
    Python programs would be well served by by having an
    interactive user-interface without the overhead or
    requirements of a graphical environment.  For interactive
    text mode programs (under Linux/Unix), the <code>ncurses</code> library,
    and Python's standard <em><code>curses</code></em> module as a wrapper for it,
    are just what you need for your program.  This article
    discusses the use of <code>curses</code> in Python, and uses example
    source code in the form of a front-end to the Txt2Html
    program developed throughout this column.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Python? What Is Curses?</h3>
 <p>
  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.
</p>
<p>
  <code>curses</code> (usually <code>ncurses</code> in practice) is a library whose
  routines give a programmer a terminal-independent method of
  controlling character screens.  <code>curses</code> is a standard part of
  most Unix-like systems, including Linux; ports are available
  for Windows and other systems as well.  <code>curses</code> programs will
  run on text-only systems, as well as within xterm's and other
  windowed console sessions, which provides a very broad coverage
  for these applications.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>
  The interface features available in Python's standard <em><code>curses</code></em>
  module are limited to the features available in essentially
  every type of "glass teletype" (the archaism here indicates the
  1970s origins of <code>curses</code>).  There a number of ways to bring
  greater sophistication to interactive text-mode programs
  written in Python; and these fall into two categories.  On the
  one hand, Python modules exist to provide support for the
  full-feature set of <code>ncurses</code> (which is a superset of <code>curses</code>)
  or <code>slang</code> (which is a similar but independent console
  library).  Most notably, using one of these enhanced libraries
  by way of an appropriate Python module wrapper, adds color
  support to your application.  On the other hand, a number of
  high-level widget libraries exist that are built on top
  <code>curses</code> (or <code>ncurses</code> / <code>slang</code>) that add features like buttons,
  menus, scroll-bars, and various common interface devices.
  Programmers who have worked with (or even just seen
  applications developed in) libraries such as Borland's
  TurboWindows (for DOS) will be familiar with how many of these
  features can look very attractive in text-mode consoles.  There
  is nothing in the widget libraries that you <strong>could not</strong> do
  yourself with just <em><code>curses</code></em>, but some other programmers have
  put some thought into how to wrap up high-level interfaces.
  See the Resources section for links to the modules mentioned.
</p>
<p>
  In this article, we'll be limiting ourselves to the features of
  <em><code>curses</code></em> itself.  Since the <em><code>curses</code></em> module is part of the
  standard distribution, you can expect it to be available
  without requiring users to download support libraries or other
  Python modules (at least on *nix systems).  Also, it is useful
  to have an understanding of the base support provided by
  <em><code>curses</code></em> even as a building-block for use of modules built on
  top of it.  Even with <em><code>curses</code></em> alone, it is quite easy to build
  attractive and useful text-mode applications in Python.  One
  footnote to notice is that pre-release notes suggest that
  Python 2.0 will include an enhanced version of <em><code>curses</code></em>, but
  this should be backward-compatible in any case.
</p>
<h3>The Application</h3>
 <p>
  As a test application for this article, the author will discuss
  a wrapper he has written for the <code>Txt2Html</code> program introduced
  in "Charming Python #3", whose techniques were discussed
  further in subsequent columns.  <code>Txt2Html</code> works in several
  ways, but for purposes of this article, we are interested in
  <code>Txt2Html</code> as a command-line format conversion program.  One
  way to operate <code>Txt2Html</code> is to feed it a bunch of command-line
  arguments indicating various aspects of the conversion to be
  performed, and let the application run as a batch process.  For
  occassional usage, it might be friendlier for users to be
  presented with an interactive selection screen that leads users
  through conversion options, and provides visual feedback of
  options selected, before performing the actual conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The application <code>curses_txt2html</code> is structured in terms of
  a familiar topbar menu with drop-downs and nested submenus.
  All of the menuing functions were done "from scratch" on top of
  curses.  As a result, these menus lack some of the features of
  more sophisticated <em><code>curses</code></em> wrapper programs, but the basic
  functionality can be implemented in a moderate number of lines
  using only <em><code>curses</code></em>.  In addition, a simple scrolling help box
  is implemented, and several user-input fields.  The below are
  screenshots of the application that show the general layout and
  style.

</p>
<h3>Wrapping A <em><code>curses</code></em> Application</h3>
 <p>
  The basic concept of <em><code>curses</code></em> programming is defining window
  objects.  A window is a region of the actual physical screen
  that can perform positional input and output (using coordinates
  relative to the window), can be moved around, and can be
  created and deleted independently of other windows.  Within a
  window object, the cursor is the position at which input or
  output actions take place; the cursor is usually set explicitly
  by input and output methods, but it can also be modified
  independently.
</p>
<p>
  One consequence of initializing curses is that stream-oriented
  console input and output is modified or disabled in various
  ways.  This is basically the whole point of using <em><code>curses</code></em>;
  but one effect of disabling streaming console interaction is
  that Python traceback events are not displayed in a normal
  manner in the case of program errors.  Andrew Kuchling
  provided a good top-level framework for setting up <em><code>curses</code></em>
  programs in his tutorial (see Resources).  Using this template
  (basically the same as Kuchling's) allows you to maintain the
  error-reporting capabilities of normal command-line Python:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Top level setup code for Python [curses] program</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>import</B></FONT> curses, traceback
<FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> __name__==<FONT COLOR=#115511>'__main__'</FONT>:
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>try</B></FONT>:
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Initialize curses</FONT>
      stdscr=curses.initscr()
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Turn off echoing of keys, and enter cbreak mode,</FONT>
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># where no buffering is performed on keyboard input</FONT>
      curses.noecho()
      curses.cbreak()

      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># In keypad mode, escape sequences for special keys</FONT>
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># (like the cursor keys) will be interpreted and</FONT>
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># a special value like curses.KEY_LEFT will be returned</FONT>
      stdscr.keypad(1)
      main(stdscr)                    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Enter the main loop</FONT>
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Set everything back to normal</FONT>
      stdscr.keypad(0)
      curses.echo()
      curses.nocbreak()
      curses.endwin()                 <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Terminate curses</FONT>
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>except</B></FONT>:
      <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># In event of error, restore terminal to sane state.</FONT>
      stdscr.keypad(0)
      curses.echo()
      curses.nocbreak()
      curses.endwin()
      traceback.print_exc()           <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Print the exception</PRE></FONT></div><p>
  Within the <code>try</code> block we perform a few initialization calls,
  then call the <code>main()</code> function to perform the actual
  application functionality, then finally perform a bit of final
  cleanup.  Just in case something went wrong in the above steps,
  the <code>except</code> block restores the console to its default state,
  and reports the exceptions encountered.
</p>
<h3>Our Main Event Loop</h3>
 <p>
  Let us take a look now at what our specific <code>curses_txt2html</code>
  application does by looking at its <code>main()</code> function.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>curses_txt2html.py main() function and event loop</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="main"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> main</B></FONT></A>(stdscr):
    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Frame the interface area at fixed VT100 size</FONT>
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>global</B></FONT> screen
    screen = stdscr.subwin(23, 79, 0, 0)
    screen.box()
    screen.hline(2, 1, curses.ACS_HLINE, 77)
    screen.refresh()

    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Define the topbar menus</FONT>
    file_menu = (<FONT COLOR=#115511>"File"</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"file_func()"</FONT>)
    proxy_menu = (<FONT COLOR=#115511>"Proxy Mode"</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"proxy_func()"</FONT>)
    doit_menu = (<FONT COLOR=#115511>"Do It!"</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"doit_func()"</FONT>)
    help_menu = (<FONT COLOR=#115511>"Help"</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"help_func()"</FONT>)
    exit_menu = (<FONT COLOR=#115511>"Exit"</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"EXIT"</FONT>)
    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Add the topbar menus to screen object</FONT>
    topbar_menu((file_menu, proxy_menu, doit_menu,
                 help_menu, exit_menu))

    <FONT COLOR=#1111CC># Enter the topbar menu loop</FONT>
    <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>while</B></FONT> topbar_key_handler():
        draw_dict()</PRE></div><p>
  Our <code>main()</code> function does a few things.  It is easy to think
  of this function in terms of the three sections seperated by
  blank lines.
</p>
<p>
  The first section performs some general setup of our
  application's appearance.  In order to establish some
  predictable spacing relations between application elements, we
  decided to limit our interactive area to an 80x25 VT100/PC
  screen size (even if an actual terminal window is larger).  We
  draw a visual box around this sub-window, and use a horizontal
  line for visual offset of the topbar menus.
</p>
<p>
  The second section establishes the particular menus used by our
  applications.  The function <code>topbar_menu()</code> performs a little
  bit of magic in binding hotkeys to application actions, and
  displaying menus with the desired visual attributes.  Check out
  the source archive provided for the full code to this.
  <code>topbar_menu()</code> should be pretty generic to whatever menus you
  might want to use, and you are welcome to incorporate it into
  your own applications.  The main thing to know is just that
  once the hotkeys are bound, they <code>eval()</code> whatever string is
  contained in the second element of the tuple associated with a
  menu.  For example, activating the "File" menu in the above
  setup will wind up calling <code>eval("file_func()")</code>.  Therefore,
  the application is required to define a function called
  <code>file_func()</code>, and this function is also required to return a
  boolean value indicating whether an application end-state has
  been reached.
</p>
<p>
  The third section--with just two lines--is where the whole
  application actually runs.  The function <code>topbar_key_handler()</code>
  does pretty much what its name suggests.  It waits for
  keystrokes, then handles them.  The key handler might return a
  boolean false value, and if it does that ends the application.
  In our application, the key handler consists of a check for the
  keys that were bound by the second section; but even if your
  <em><code>curses</code></em> application does not bind keys in the same manner, you
  will still want to use an event loop similar to the above. The
  key thing is that your handler will probably use a line like,
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>c = screen.getch()   # read a keypress

</pre></div><p>
  within its key hander.  Our <code>draw_dict()</code> function is the only
  thing directly within the event loop.  In our case, this
  function draws some values in a few locations in the <code>screen</code>
  window; but in any application you will probably want to
  include a line like,
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>screen.refresh()   # redraw the screen w/ any new output

</pre></div><p>
  inside your drawing/refresh function (or just inside the event
  loop itself).
</p>
<h3>Getting User Input</h3>
 <p>
  Probably the main thing a <em><code>curses</code></em> application needs to do is
  get input (keypress) events from the user.  That is how the
  application is used, after all.  We have already seen the
  <code>.getch()</code> method, so let us look at an example that combines
  <code>.getch()</code> with the other input method <code>.getstr()</code>.  Below is
  an abbreviated version of the <code>file_func()</code> function we have
  mentioned (it is activated by the "File" menu):
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>curses_txt2html.py file_func() function</h4><PRE><FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>def</B></FONT><A NAME="file_func"><FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B> file_func</B></FONT></A>():
  s = curses.newwin(5,10,2,1)
  s.box()
  s.addstr(1,2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"I"</FONT>, hotkey_attr)
  s.addstr(1,3, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"nput"</FONT>, menu_attr)
  s.addstr(2,2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"O"</FONT>, hotkey_attr)
  s.addstr(2,3, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"utput"</FONT>, menu_attr)
  s.addstr(3,2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"T"</FONT>, hotkey_attr)
  s.addstr(3,3, <FONT COLOR=#115511>"ype"</FONT>, menu_attr)
  s.addstr(1,2, <FONT COLOR=#115511>""</FONT>, hotkey_attr)
  s.refresh()
  c = s.getch()
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>if</B></FONT> c <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>in</B></FONT> (ord(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'I'</FONT>), ord(<FONT COLOR=#115511>'i'</FONT>), curses.KEY_ENTER, 10):
      curses.echo()
      s.erase()
      screen.addstr(5,33, <FONT COLOR=#115511>" "</FONT>*43, curses.A_UNDERLINE)
      cfg_dict[<FONT COLOR=#115511>'source'</FONT>] = screen.getstr(5,33)
      curses.noecho()
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>else</B></FONT>:
      curses.beep()
      s.erase()
  <FONT COLOR=#3333CC><B>return</B></FONT> CONTINUE</PRE></div><p>
  This function combines several <em><code>curses</code></em> features.  The first
  thing it does is create another window object.  This new
  window object is the actual drop-down menu for the "File"
  topbar menu. Therefore, we also decide to draw a frame around
  the window with the <code>.box()</code> method.  Within the window <code>s</code> we
  draw several menu options corresponding to the options in the
  drop-down menu.  A slightly laborious method is used because
  we want to have the hotkey for each option highlighted to
  contrast with the rest of the option description (take a look
  at <code>topbar_menu()</code> in the full source for a somewhat more
  automated handling of the highlights.  The final <code>.addstr()</code>
  call is used to place the cursor on top of the default menu
  action.  As with the main screen, we call <code>s.refresh()</code> to
  actually display the elements we have drawn to the window
  object.
</p>
<p>
  Once we have drawn our drop-down menu, we want to read in a
  users selection.  This is done with the simple <code>s.getch()</code>
  call.  In our demonstration application, menus only respond to
  hotkeys, not to arrow-key selection and movable highlight bars.
  These more sophisticated menuing functions could be built by
  capturing additional key actions, and setting up event loops
  within drop-down menus.  But the example suffices to get the
  idea.
</p>
<p>
  Next we need to compare the read in keystroke against various
  hotkey values.  In the above case, a drop-down menu option can
  be activated by an upper or lower case version of its hotkey,
  and the default option can be activated with the ENTER key.
  The <em><code>curses</code></em> special key constants do not seem to be entirely
  reliable, and this author found that adding the actual ASCII
  value "10" was necessary to trap the ENTER key.  Notice that if
  you wish to perform a comparison to a character value, you want
  to wrap the character's string in the <code>ord()</code> built-in Python
  function.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming the "Input" option is selected, we get to the use of
  the <code>.getstr()</code> method.  This method provides field entry with
  crude entry editing capability (you can use the backspace key).
  Entry is terminated by the ENTER key.  Whatever value is
  entered is returned by the method, and will generally be
  assigned to a variable, as in the above example.  A little
  trick the author used to help visually distinguish the entry
  field was to pre-underline the area where the field entry would
  occur.  Doing this is not necessary by any means, but it adds a
  little visual flair.  The underline is performed by the line:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>screen.addstr(5,33, " "*43, curses.A_UNDERLINE)

</pre></div><p>
  Of course, you will also want to remove the field entry
  emphasis, which happens to be done within the <code>draw_dict()</code>
  refresh function in our application, with the line:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>screen.addstr(5,33, " "*43, curses.A_NORMAL)


</pre></div><h3>Finally</h3>
 <p>
  The techniques outlined here--and especially those additional
  ones used in the full application source code should get you
  started with <em><code>curses</code></em> programming.  Play with it a bit, it is
  not hard to work with.  One nice thing is that the <code>curses</code>
  library may be accessed by many languages other than Python
  also, so what you learn using Python's <em><code>curses</code></em> module is
  mostly transferrable elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  If the base <em><code>curses</code></em> module starts to have more limitations
  than you wish, the Resources section provides links to a number
  of modules that add on to the capabilities of <em><code>curses</code></em>, and
  provide a nice gentle path for growth.

  Python <em><code>ncurses</code></em> is an enhanced module to support a larger
  range of <code>ncurses</code> functionality than Python 1.5.2 <em><code>curses</code></em>
  does.  Preliminary plans are to have <em><code>ncurses</code></em> replace <em><code>curses</code></em>
  in Python 2.0.  <em><code>ncurses</code></em> can be found at:

  An under-publicized--and somewhat hard to track
  down--alternative to <code>ncurses</code> and various wrappers is the
  combination of <code>slang</code> and <code>newt</code> with the python wrapper
  module <em><code>snack</code></em>.  <code>slang</code> does roughly what <code>curses</code> does, and
  <code>newt</code> does roughly what <em><code>Tinter</code></em> does.  One place to find
  these modules, and supporting libraries is:

  <em><code>pcrt</code></em> is a module for direct ANSI escape-code screen access.
  This allows writing to specific locations on screen, and with
  specific colors and attributes.  It is a low-level interace
  (even more so than <code>curses</code>) and will only work on consoles
  that support ANSI escape-codes (which is most of them).  But
  it is a nice way to add some splash to your text-mode
  applications:

  <em><code>dialog</code></em> is a Python wrapper around the Linux <code>dialog</code>
  utility. The utility (and its Python wrapper) lets you create
  yes/no, menu, input, message, text, info checklist and
  radiolist dialogs.  It is really possible to do a lot very
  quickly using this utility and module, if the platform
  restriction is not a problem (the target Linux distribution
  will need to have <code>dialog</code>, of course):
