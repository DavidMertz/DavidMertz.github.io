<blockquote>    This series looks at several distinct conceptual models for 
        manipulating XML documents.  But this final article serves as    
a  reflection and critique on programmers assumptions that XML     manipulation 
  should have <em>any</em> conceptual model.  Rather than     find a particular 
  paradigm for thinking about XML, and     providing API's for many programming 
  languages, some tools     take the opposite approach.  That is, these latter 
  tools     start with the paradigms and, even more so, <em>idioms</em> of 
 a     particular programming language, then try to figure out the     most 
 natural way to manipulate XML within these idioms </blockquote>
  <h2>About This Series</h2>
  <p>  As XML has developed into a widely used data format, a number   of
    programming models have arisen for manipulating XML   documents.  Some
 of   these models--or "paradigms"--have been   enshrined as standards, while
  others  remain only informally   specified (but equally widely used nonetheless).
     In a general   way, the several models available for manipulating XML
   documents closely mirror the underlying approaches and   techniques that
  programmers in different traditions bring to   the task of working with
XML.   It is worth noticing that   "models" are at a higher level of abstraction
  than a particular   programming language; most of the models discussed
in   this   series are associated with APIs that have been implemented in
  multiple   programming languages. </p>
  <p>  In part, the richness of available XML programming models   simply
    allows programmers and projects to work in the ways that   are most comfortable
    and familiar to them.  In many ways, there   is overlap--at least in
achievable     outcomes--between all the   XML programming models.  However,
different   models  also carry   with them specific pros and cons in the
context of XML    manipulation;  and these might urge the use of particular
models   for particular projects.   This series of five articles aims to
  provide readers with an overview of the costs, benefits, and   motivations
for all of the major approaches to programmatic   manipulation of XML documents
(manipulation  here, should be   understood also to mean "using XML to drive
or communicate    other application  processes"). </p>
  <p>  The first article, Part 1, discussed the OOP-style Document   Object
    Model (DOM), which is a W3C Recommendation.  Part 2   discussed the Simple
    API for XML (SAX) and similar event-driven   and procedural styles of
XML    programming.  Part 3, covered   eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
    (XSLT) Part 4,   addressed functional programming (FP) approaches to
XML      processing, with examples from the Haskell HaXml library.  This
  final     installment, Part 5, looks briefly at a number of tools   and
techniques    that did not quite fit into the previous   discussion.  What
these tools   have in common is that their   structure and usage has a lot
more to do with  the programming   languages used to manipulate XML than
with the inherent      structure of XML. </p>
  <h2>When Standards Get in the Way</h2>
  <p>  The techniques presented in the previous installments of this   series
    have many conceptual differences between them.  But at a   meta-conceptual
    level, all the techniques share a surprisingly   close affinity.  That
 is,   even though DOM is pure OOP, SAX is   event-driven and procedural,
and XSLT   is pure declarative   programming, developing the paradigm for
each one followed  the   same path.  For all of them, someone started with
a question   like  "How should I think about XML documents, and about the
  transformations  one can make upon them?"  In each case the   answer was
a particular programming   paradigm.  Actually   implementing the abstract
API implied by the paradigm   choice   came later when libraries were written
for numerous programming    languages. </p>
  <p>  DOM, SAX, and XSLT each have their own sort of conceptual   purity.
     Perhaps the developers of each were most familiar or   most comfortable
   with the corresponding paradigm; or more   likely these developers merely
   wanted to develop APIs that   flowed from underlying conceptual models.
  The drawback of each   of these techniques is that they need to be shoehorned
   into   particular programming languages.  The APIs and proscribed   styles
   of programming around these APIs only fit concrete   programming languages
   in a rough way.  The data structures of   DOM, for example, can certainly
   be represented in many   programming languages, but they are not really
 the  most   idiomatic way of using data in any of them.  XSLT, as was  
described    in the previous installment, is its own   complete--albeit special--language,
   rather than really an API.   But inasmuch as XSLT transformations are
often    defined and   executed inside other programs, they have a "bolted-on"
feel    to   them (you need this whole other language, living inside your
  main   application language).  SAX, just because it <em>does</em> the 
 least also   creates the least "impedance mismatch" when called   from various
programming   languages.   </p>
  <p>  Some library developers have decided to approach XML   manipulation
    from a different direction.  Rather than start out   worrying about what
   the XML format suggests as a paradigm,   these latter developers start
by   thinking about which native   idioms of a given programming language
most   naturally express   the contents of an XML document.  A set of built-in,
  or at   least ubiquitous in usage, data structures are chosen to hold 
 all  the bits-and-pieces of XML, and the language-native flow   constructs
are  chosen to descibe the manipulation process.   This alternative approach
eschews  paradigms, and focusses on   practicality and simplicity.  Naturally,
one  drawback to this   practical approach is that every library and technique
  is   wholly like every other, and much less knowledge and practice   transfers
  between different languages, libraries and   techniques.  It is a drawback
  often worth living with. </p>
  <p>  One thing left out of the above summary is the subject of the   fourth
    installment of this series.  The Haskell library   HaXml--as well as
the    other functional programming language   libraries indicated in the
Resources    of that installment--have   already taken the main steps towards
a programming-language       focus.  In a sense, HaXml would fit well in
this installment.   However,     given the special strengths of functional
programming   for XML processing--type     safety, complex data types,  
higher-order functions, and the general stark    contrast with   imperative
languages--FP deserved its own installment.    </p>
  <p>  In the rest of this installment, we take a look at a handful of  
different "native-oriented" XML libraries in a half-dozen   programming languages.
 Other libraries probably exist, but   this gives readers a feel for the
terrain.   </p>
  <h2>A Line-Oriented Xml</h2>
  <p>  The PYX format is a line-oriented representation of XML   documents
    that is derived from the SGML ESIS format.  PYX is   not itself XML,
but    it is able to represent all the information   within an XML document
in  a  manner that is easier to handle   using familiar text processing tools.
  Moreover, PYX documents   can themselves be transformed back into XML as
 needed.  It is   worth noting that PYX documents are approximately the same
 size   as the corresponding XML versions (sometimes a little larger,   sometimes
  a little smaller); so storage and transmission   considerations do not
significantly     enter into the   transformation between XML and PYX. </p>
  <p>  The PYX format is extremely simple to describe and understand.   The
    first character on each line identifies the content-type of   the line.
   Content does not directly span lines, although   successive lines might
 contain the same content-type.  In the   case of tag attributes, the attribute
 name and value are simply   separated by a space, without use of extra quotes.
    The prefix   characters are: </p>
  <pre>    (  start-tag     
    )  end-tag      
    A  attribute    
    -  character data    
    ?  processing instruction 
    </pre>
  <p>  The motivation for PYX is the wide usage, convenience, and   familiarity
   of line-oriented text processing tools and   techniques.  The GNU textutils,
   for example, include tools like   <code>wc</code>, <code>tail</code>,
  <code>      head</code>, <code>uniq</code>; other familiar text processing
  tools   are    <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and
in a more   sophisticated  way   <code>perl</code> and other scripting languages.
 These   types of tools    both generally expect newline-delimited records
and rely   on   regular expression patterns to identify parts of texts. 
 Neither of   the expectations is a good match for XML, as it   happens.
   </p>
  <p>  Let us take a look at PYX in action.  PYX libraries exist for   several 
   programming languages, but much of the time it is most   useful simply 
to   use the command line tools <code>xmln</code> and <code>xmlv</code> . 
  The   first is a non-validating transformation tool, the second   adds
validation   against a DTD. </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>XML and PYX versions of a document</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>[PYX]# cat test.xml<br>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE Spam SYSTEM "spam.dtd" &gt;<br>&lt;!-- Document Comment --&gt;<br>&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="test.css" type="text/css"?&gt;<br>&lt;Spam flavor="pork" size="8oz"&gt;<br>  &lt;Eggs&gt;Some text about eggs.&lt;/Eggs&gt;<br>  &lt;MoreSpam&gt;Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")&lt;/MoreSpam&gt;<br>&lt;/Spam&gt;<br><br>[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml<br>?xml-stylesheet href="test.css" type="text/css"<br>(Spam<br>Aflavor pork<br>Asize 8oz<br>-\n<br>-<br>(Eggs<br>-Some text about eggs.<br>)Eggs<br>-\n<br>-<br>(MoreSpam<br>-Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")<br>)MoreSpam<br>-\n<br>)Spam<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  One should notice that the transformation loses the DOCTYPE   declaration
    and the comment in the original XML document.  For   many purposes, this
   is not important (parsers often discard   this information also).  The
PYX   format, in contrast to the XML   format, allows one to easily pose
a variety   of ad hoc questions   about a document.  For example:  what are
all the attribute     values in the sample document?  Using PYX, we can simply
ask:   </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>An ad hoc query using PYX format</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>[PYX]# ./xmln test.xml | grep "^A" | awk '{print $2}'<br>pork<br>8oz<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  Getting this answer out of the original XML is a huge   challenge.
     Either one needs to create a whole program that   calls a parser, and
 looks   for tag attribute dictionaries, or   one needs to come up with a
quite complex   regular expression   that will find the information of interest
  (left as  an exercise   for readers).  Complicating things is the contents
  of the     <code> &lt;MoreSpam&gt;</code> element, which contains something
  that looks  a lot   like a tag attribute, but is not. </p>
  <p>  Sean McGrath's article (see Resources) has additional similar   examples. 
     </p>
  <h2>Going Native</h2>
  <p>  The API methods of DOM give one access to a certain data-structure 
      that represents an XML document.  The problem is that this   data-structure
    is very little like the built-in data types of   programming languages.
   A number of libraries have made the   move to "native" versions of XML
documents.     But in my opinion,   none has done it as thoroughly as my
own Python   <em><code>      xml_objectify</code></em>   module. </p>
  <p>  When <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> is used to read in an XML
    document, what   one gets is a very simple Python object, whose object
   attributes correspond to the subelements and attributes of the   root
document    element.  The only difference between subelements   and tag attributes
is   whether they contain futher objects or   plain text.  Testing the type
of   thing a (Python) attribute   contains is sufficient for determining
whether   it started out   as a subelement or XML attribute (but in Python
data terms,   the   difference is not really that important--it usually reflects
a   fairly   arbitrary XML design choice). </p>
  <p>  The earlier articles listed in the Resources go into the design   and
limitations of <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em>, but an example of its
usage   illustrates its strength.  Remember first how one might use DOM 
  to look at data in an XML document: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>Python DOM access to XML data structures</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre><font color="#000000"><b>from</b> xml.dom </font><font color="#000000"><b>import</b> minidom<br>dom = minidom.parse(</font><font color="#000000">'test.xml')<br></font><font color="#000000"><b>print</b> dom<br></font><font color="#000000"><b>print</b> </font><font color="#000000">'flavor='+dom.childNodes[1]._attrs[</font><font color="#000000">'flavor'].nodeValue<br></font><font color="#000000"><b>print</b> </font><font color="#000000">'PCDATA='+dom.childNodes[1].childNodes[5].childNodes[0].nodeValue</font><br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  This produces something like: </p>
  <div>
  <h3>Python DOM output from data structures      </h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>% python dom.py<br>&lt;xml.dom.minidom.Document instance at 0x8aa0c&gt;<br>flavor=pork<br>PCDATA=Ode to Spam (spam=<font color="#115511">"smoked-pork"</font>)<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  In contrast, <em><code>xml_objectify</code></em> lets a user refer
    to the XML   document data in much more intuitive, and Pythonic, ways:
   </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3><code>xml_objectify</code> access to XML data structures</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>from xml_objectify import XML_Objectify<br>py_obj = XML_Objectify('test.xml').make_instance()<br>print py_obj<br>print type(py_obj.flavor), 'flavor=' + py_obj.flavor<br>print type(py_obj.MoreSpam), 'PCDATA=' + py_obj.MoreSpam.PCDATA<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  The result is similar to the DOM version: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3><code>xml_objectify</code> output from data structures</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>% python xo.py<br>&lt;xml_objectify._XO_Spam instance at 0xe626c&gt;<br>&lt;type 'unicode'&gt; flavor=pork<br>&lt;type 'instance'&gt; PCDATA=Ode to Spam (spam="smoked-pork")<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>There's More Than One Way To Do It</h2>
  <p>  In the culture of the Perl programming language, there is a   motto
    held by programmers:  "there's more than one way to do   it."  This slogan
    is well enough known that it is usually just   abbreviated as TMTOWTDI.
   As one would expect from this motto,   Perl developers have come up with
  quite a few different ways of   handling XML.  While there <em>do</em>
exist   Perl modules to support   standards like DOM and SAX, most Perl programmers
  prefer   modules that embody the Perlish cardinal virtues:  laziness, 
 hubris,  and impatience.  Perl programmers are the types of   folks who
think they  can do it better, faster, and with less   work than conformance
with rigid  and complex standards allow. </p>
  <p>  What most of the Perl modules for XML manipulation have in   common
    is that they convert XML documents into data structures   that are more
  idiomatic  Perl.  API calls like one might find in   DOM or SAX are eschewed
  in favor  of standard data   structures--generally arrays and hashes. 
In   keeping with  the   Perl motto, several different modules often do almost,
  but not   quite,  the same thing.  Let us look first at the example of
    <em><code> XML::Grove</code></em>  .  As I have suggested, <em><code>
XML::Grove</code></em>       takes an XML   document, and creates a representation
of it in terms  of  Perl   hashes, accessed with normal Perl syntax.  A short
example   lets  us extract almost the same information in the PYX example
  above:   </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3><code>XML::Grove</code> script to print root attribute values</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>use XML::Grove;<br>use XML::Grove::Builder;<br>use XML::Parser::PerlSAX;<br>$grove_builder = XML::Grove::Builder-&gt;new;<br>$parser = XML::Parser::PerlSAX-&gt;new ( Handler =&gt; $grove_builder );<br>$document = $parser-&gt;parse ( Source =&gt; { SystemId =&gt; 'test.xml' } );<br><br># the particular has a PI and a comment before the body<br>$root = $document-&gt;{Contents}[2];   # name the document root element<br>$attrs = $root-&gt;{Attributes};       # name the root's attributs<br>foreach $attr (keys %$attrs)        # print the attribute values<br>  { print %$attrs-&gt;{$attr} . "\n" };<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  This usage is fairly straightforward, or at least rather   Perlish.
     The result is: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>Perl <code>XML::Grove</code> attribute query</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>[PERL]# perl grove.pl<br>pork<br>8oz<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  The <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em> module is quite versatile, and 
   allows several   "styles" of handling XML documents.  Some of these styles 
   are   SAX-like insofar as they utilize callbacks from serial   processing 
   of a document.  But the structure is much more   Perl-native than is using 
   all the SAX API.  But the style that   best illustrates how far <em><code>
       XML::Parser</code></em> has "gone native" is the   "tree" style. 
In  fact,   this style has an even more Perlish   feel than     <em><code>
XML::Grove</code></em>        does: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3><code>XML::Parser</code> "tree" style native data structure</h3>

      <tr>

        <pre>use XML::Parser;<br>$tree_parse = new XML::Parser(Style =&gt; 'Tree');<br>$tree = $tree_parse-&gt;parsefile('test.xml');<br><br>use Data::Dumper;<br>($Data::Dumper::Indent,$Data::Dumper::Terse) = (1,1);<br>print Dumper($tree);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  The result of this program shows all its Perl roots, and has   very
    little XML-specific about it: </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>Perl <code>XML::Parser</code> tree data structure result</h3>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>Even More Native Libraries</h2>
  <p>  By this point, the idea of using programming language native   data
    structures has probably sunk in.  A couple more libraries   for doing
this    are worth mentioning briefly. </p>
  <p>  The <em><code>REXML</code></em> library is a very well thought out
    library for the   Ruby programming language.  Much like <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em>
         for Perl,   <em><code>REXML</code></em> operates in multiple modes.
   The  stream parser works in   a way similar to SAX, but with a more Ruby-oriented
    syntax.   The tree mode is the most interesting.  Basically, this mode
 is     quite similar to the data representation one gets with   <em><code>
   xml_objectify</code></em>      of <em><code>XML::Parser</code></em> "Tree"
 style.  One advantage   the     <em><code>REXML</code></em> library has
is  its integration of an XPATH-like     region specifier syntax.  Combined
with  the rest of Ruby's   concise syntax,  one can be extremely expressive
without    DOM-style contortions.  For example,  the REXML tutorial shows
  these lines:   </p>
  <div align="Center">
  <h3>REXML tree mode parsing and data structure</h3>
  </div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="80%" align="Center" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>require "rexml/document"<br>include REXML    # don't have to prefix everything with REXML::<br>doc = Document.new File.new("mydoc.xml")<br>doc.elements.each("inventory/section")<br>    { |element| puts element.attributes["name"] }<br>    # -&gt; health<br>    # -&gt; food<br></pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>  Java gets in the native game also.  Even though DOM was itself   largely 
   styled around Java, the programming language neutral   methods of DOM are
   still unnecessarily complex to work with   (even in Java).  JDOM is a
more    Java-native version of XML   processing.  Let's just look at the JDOM
mission    statement to   make the point: </p>
  <blockquote>    There is no compelling reason for a Java API to manipulate
    XML to     be complex, tricky, unintuitive, or a pain in the neck.  JDOM 
       is both Java-centric and Java-optimized.  It behaves like Java,   
 it  uses Java collections, it is completely natural API for     current Java
 developers, and it provides a low-cost entry point     for using XML.  
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>    While JDOM interoperates well with existing standards
    such as the     Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document Object Model
 (DOM),   it     is not an abstraction layer or enhancement to those APIs.
 Rather,      it seeks to provide a robust, light-weight means of reading
and     writing  XML data without the complex and memory-consumptive    
options that current  API offerings provide. </blockquote>
      <p>  What more could I write? </p>
      <h2>Wrapup</h2>
      <p>  There is one more class of Native-to-XML libraries that I   should 
   mention briefly.  All the above tools were ways of   making XML documents 
   look like the native data structures of a   favorite programming language 
   (this is even true of PYX, where   some tools prefer to see newline delimited 
   records).  But one   can go in the other direction also.  For various reasons,
   one   sometimes want to create serialized representations of native  
in-memory    objects.  Many programming languages have   internal--and  often
binary--formats    for representing their   objects.  But a number of developers
have decided    that XML, as   the "universal interchange format"  would
make a good   serialization    format. </p>
      <p>  Some of the XML serializers I know about are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My own Python <em><code>xml_pickle</code></em> module.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Perl's <em><code>DataDump::DumpXML</code></em> and           
         <em><code>DataDump::DumpXML::Parser</code></em>       modules&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Ruby's <em><code>XMarshall</code></em> module   (which seems 
little maintained,       however).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Java library JSX.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>XML-RPC is a cross-language library for remote   procedure   
   calls.  However, calling a procedure and returning a value          wind 
up requiring a means of representing data structures.       I  look at the 
possibility of adapting XML-RPC to the needs       of object  serialization 
 in an earlier article (see       Resources). <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What all these libraries do is very similar.  Unfortunately     
though, as of right now, the XML dialects of each serializer is   slightly
    different from the others.  A unification might allow   a lightweight
means    of exchanging objects between programming   languages. </p>
