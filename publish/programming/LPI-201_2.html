<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of eight tutorials helps you
  prepare for the first of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 201. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 202. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 201 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 201: Linux Kernel (5)
  </strong> Topic 202: System Startup (5)
  <strong> Topic 203: Filesystems (10)
  </strong> Topic 204: Hardware (8)
  <strong> Topic 209: File Sharing Servers (8)
  </strong> Topic 211: System Maintenance (4)
  <strong> Topic 213: System Customization and Automation (3)
  </strong> Topic 214: Troubleshooting (6)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Understanding the System Startup", the second of eight
  tutorials designed to prepare you for LPI exam 201. In this tutorial
  you will learn the steps a Linux system goes through during system
  initialization, and how to modify and customize those behaviors for
  you specific needs.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About the Linux system startup
</h3>
 <p>
  This tutorial is at the border of Linux, strictly speaking. Topic 201
  addressed the kernel itself, which is the core of Linux. This tutorial
  moves on to the ancillary tools and scripts that are necessary both to
  get the kernel running, and to initialize a system to the point it
  does something meaningful. Hower the scripts and tools associated with
  initialization are maintained by the creators of Linux distributions,
  or individualized by system administrators, rather than developed as
  part of the Linux kernel per se.  Still, every Linux system--even an
  embedded one--will require some basic initialization steps similar to
  those discussed here.
</p>
<p>
  In later tutorials, we will look at a variety of tools for networking,
  system maintenance, manipulating files and data, and so on, which are
  important for a working Linux installation and part of almost every
  Linux distribution, but are even less part of Linux per se than are
  initialization scripts.
</p>
<h3>The Linux Boot Process</h3>
 <h3>What happens when you turn a Linux computer on? (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  It is useful to break the Linux boot process into 9 steps that will
  occur in almost every Linux configuration.  Steps 10 and beyond might
  involve launching additional services, logging into a graphical
  environment, restoring UI settings, or other more personalized details
  that are outside this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  1. Hardware/firmware: The BIOS or firmware system reads the master
     boot record on the harddisk or other boot device (e.g. CD, floppy,
     netboot, etc).
</p>
<p>
  2. A boot loader runs. Linux systems on x86 systems typically use
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>LILO</code> or <code>GRUB</code>. Some older systems might use <code>loadlin</code> to boot via
    an intermediate DOS partition. On PowerPC systems, this might be
    <code>BootX</code> or <code>yaboot</code>. In general, a boot loader is a simple program
    that knows where to look for the Linux kernel, perhaps choosing
    among several versions, or even selecting other operating systems on
    the same machine.
</blockquote>
<p>
  3. The kernel loads.
</p>
<p>
  4. The root filesystem is mounted.  In some cases, a temporary
     ramdisk image is loaded before the true root filesystem to enable
     special drivers or modules that might be necessary for the true
     root filesystem.
</p>
<p>
  Keep reading boot steps on the next page
</p>
<h3>What happens when you turn a Linux computer on? (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  One we have a root filesystem in place (see last page), we are ready
  for initialization proper.
</p>
<p>
  5. Start the process <code>init</code>, the parent of all other Linux processes.
</p>
<p>
  6. Read the contents of <code>/etc/inittab</code> to configure the remaining boot
     steps.  Of special importance is the line in <code>/etc/inittab</code> that
     controls the runlevel the system will boot to (and therefore, which
     further steps will be taken during initialization).
</p>
<p>
  Actually, everything after this point is completely controlled by the
  content of the file <code>/etc/inittab</code>.  Specifically, the scripts and
  tools that run generally follow some conventions, but in theory you
  could completely change <code>/etc/inittab</code> to run different scripts.
</p>
<p>
  One specific setting in <code>/etc/inittab</code> is particularly crucial.  A
  line similar to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>id:5:initdefault:

</pre></div><p>
  Generally occurs near the top of the file, and sets the <code>runlevel</code>.
  This runlevel controls what actions are taken in the remainder on the
  <code>/etc/inittab</code> script.
</p>
<h3>What happens when you turn a Linux computer on? (part three)
</h3>
 <p>
  Just what happens as an <code>/etc/inittab</code> script is processed? And
  specifically, what conventional files and directories are involved in
  the process?
</p>
<p>
  7. Runlevel-neutral system initialization.  Generally there are some
     initialization actions that are performed regardless of runlevel.
     These steps are indicated in <code>/etc/inittab</code> with a line like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># System initialization.
si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

     On some Linux systems (mostly Debian based), you will see something
     more like:

si::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

     If the latter case, '/etc/init.d/rcS' is a script that simply runs
     each of the scripts matching '/etc/rcS.d/[Ss]??*'. On the other
     hand, if your system uses '/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit', that file
     contains a single long script to perform *all* the initialization.

</pre></div><h3>What happens when you turn a Linux computer on? (part four)
</h3>
 <p>
  8. Runlevel-specific system initialization.  You may actually define
     as many actions as you like related to runlevel, and each action
     may pertain to one or more runlevels.  As a rule, <code>/etc/inittab</code>
     will contain some lines like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>l0:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 0
# ...
l5:5:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 5
l6:6:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 6

     In turn, the script '/etc/rc.d/rc' will run all the files
     matched by the pattern '/etc/rc$1.d/[KkSs]??*'.  For example, on
     the sample system described, that start at runlevel 5, we would run
     (in order):

/etc/rc5.d/K15postgresql
/etc/rc5.d/S01switchprofile
/etc/rc5.d/S05harddrake
...
/etc/rc5.d/S55sshd
...
/etc/rc5.d/S99linuxconf
/etc/rc5.d/S99local

     The files(s) starting with 'K' or 'k' are "kill scripts" that end
     processes or cleanup their actions.  Those starting with 'S' or 's'
     are startup scripts that generally launch new processes or
     otherwise prepare the system to run at that runlevel.  Most of
     these files ran will be shell scripts, and most will be links
     (often to files in '/etc/init.d/')

</pre></div><h3>Logging into the running Linux system
</h3>
 <p>
  Most of the time, once a Linux system is running at a runlevel, you
  wish to log into the system as a user.  To let that happen, a program
  called <code>getty</code> runs to handle the login process.  A number of
  variations on the basic <code>getty</code> are used by distribution creators,
  such as <code>agetty</code>, <code>mgetty</code> and <code>mingetty</code>.  All do basically the same
  thing, however.
</p>
<p>
  9. Login at the prompt.  Our good friend <code>/etc/inittab</code>/ will usually
     launch <code>getty</code> programs on one or more virtual terminals, and do so
     in for several different runlevels.  Those are configured with
     lines like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># Run gettys in standard runlevels
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6

     The first number is reminds us of the virtual terminal where the
     getty runs, the next set of number are the several runlevels where
     this will happen. E.g. we launch 'mingetty' in all of the runlevels
     2, 3, 4 and 5.

</pre></div><h3>Understanding runlevels
</h3>
 <p>
  The concept of runlevel is somewhat arbitrary, or at least it is not
  hardcoded into a Linux kernel.  Valid runlevel numbers to set with the
  <code>initdefault</code> option (or override otherwise) are 0-6.  By convention,
  the following meanings are given to each number:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># Default runlevel. The runlevels used by Mandrake Linux are:
#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#   1 - Single user mode
#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
#   3 - Full multiuser mode
#   4 - unused
#   5 - X11
#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)

</pre></div><p>
  This convention, as you can see, is as used in the Mandrake Linux
  distribution, but most distributions obey the same convention.  Text
  only or embedded distributions might omit usage of some of the levels,
  but will still reserve their hypothetical use at the given numbers.
</p>
<h3>Configuration lines in /etc/inittab
</h3>
 <p>
  We have seen a number of <code>/etc/inittab</code> lines in examples, but it is
  worth understanding explicitly what these lines do.  Each one has the
  format:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>id:runlevels:action:process

</pre></div><p>
  The <code>id</code> field is simply a short abbreviation naming the configuration
  line (1-4 character in recent versions of <code>init</code>, 1-2 in ancient
  ones).  The <code>runlevels</code> we have explained well enough.  Next is the
  action taken by the line.  Some actions are "special", such as:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now

</pre></div><p>
  Which traps the ctrl-alt-delete key sequence (regardless of runlevel).
  But most actions simply relate to spawning.  A non-exhaustive list of
  actions includes:
</p>
<p>
  * <code>respawn</code>: The process will be restarted whenever it terminates (e.g.
</p>
<blockquote>
    getty).
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>wait</code>: The process will be started once when the specified runlevel
</p>
<blockquote>
    is entered and init will wait for its termination.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>once</code>: The process will be executed once when the specified
</p>
<blockquote>
    runlevel is entered.
</blockquote>
<p>
  * <code>boot</code>: The  process will be executed during system boot (but after
</p>
<blockquote>
    sysinit).  The runlevels field is ignored.
</blockquote>
<h3>Customizing System Startup</h3>
 <h3>What is a boot loader?
</h3>
 <p>
  A few years ago, a program called <code>lilo</code> was pretty much universally
  used to boot Linux on x86 systems. The name <code>lilo</code> is short for "LInux
  LOader." Nowadays, another program called <code>grub</code> (GRand Unified
  Bootloader) is more popular.  On non-x86 Linux systems, other boot
  loaders are used, but they are generally configured in the same manner
  as <code>lilo</code> or <code>grub</code>.
</p>
<p>
  While there are differences in their configuration syntaxes, <code>lilo</code>
  and <code>grub</code> perform largely the same task.  Basically, either one
  presents a choice of operating systems (including, perhaps, multiple
  Linux kernels), and loads the selected OS kernel into memory.  Both
  programs let you pass arguments on to a Linux kernel along the way,
  and both can be configured to boot non-Linux operating systems on the
  same machine.
</p>
<p>
  Either <code>lilo</code> or <code>grub</code> (or other boot loaders) generally live in the
  MBR (Master Boot Record) of the primary harddisk, which is
  automatically loaded by system BIOS.  <code>lilo</code> was restricted to loading
  specific raw sector from a harddisk.  <code>grub</code> is more sophisticated in
  itself understanding a number of filesystem types such as ext2/3,
  ReiserFS, VFAT, UFS.  This means that <code>grub</code> doesn't need to rewrite
  the MBR every time a configuration file is changes, as <code>lilo</code> requires.
</p>
<h3>Configuring the LILO boot loader (part one)
</h3>
 <p>
  The <code>lilo</code> boot loader is configured with the contents of the file
  <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code>.  For full details on configuration options, read the
  <code>man</code> page on <code>lilo.conf</code>.  Several initial options control general
  behavior.  For example, you will often see <code>boot=/dev/hda</code> or similar;
  this means to install <code>lilo</code> to the MBR of the first IDE harddisk.
  You might also install <code>lilo</code> within a particular partition, usually
  because you use a different main boot loader.  For example,
  <code>boot=/dev/sda3</code> installs lilo to the third partition of the first
  SCSI disk.  Other options control the appearance and wait time of
  <code>lilo</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The thing to keep in mind is that after you have edited a
  <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> configuration, you need to run <code>lilo</code> to actually
  install a new boot sector used during initialization.  It is easy to
  forget to install new settings, but the boot loader itself cannot read
  the configuration, except as encoded as raw sector offsets (which
  <code>lilo</code> calculates when run).
</p>
<h3>Configuring the LILO boot loader (part two)
</h3>
 <p>
  In the main, when using <code>lilo</code> you are interested in the one or more
  <code>image=</code> lines, and perhaps in some <code>other=</code> lines if you multiboot to
  other operating systems. A sample <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> might contain:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>image=/boot/bzImage-2.7.4
      label="experimental"
image=/boot/vmlinuz
      label="linux"
      initrd=/boot/initrd.img
      append="devfs=mount acpi=off quiet"
      vga=788
      read-only
other=/dev/hda3
      label=dos

</pre></div><p>
  This would allow you to choose at runtime either a 2.7.4 development
  kernel, or a stable kernel (the latter happens to utilize an initial
  ramdrive during boot). You can also select a DOS installation
  installed to partition 3 on the first IDE drive.
</p>
<h3>Configuring the GRUB boot loader
</h3>
 <p>
  A nice thing about <code>grub</code> is that it does not need to be reinstalled
  each time you change boot configuration.  Of course, you <strong>do</strong> need to
  install it once in the first place, usually using a command like
  <code>grub-install /dev/hda</code>.  Generally, distributions will do this for
  you during installation, so you may never explicitly run this.
</p>
<p>
  However, since <code>grub</code> knows how to read many filesystems, normally you
  can simply change the contents of <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code> to change the
  options for the next bootup.  Let us look at a sample configuration:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>timeout 5
color black/yellow yellow/black
default 0
password secretword

title linux
kernel (hd0,1)/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda2 quiet
vga=788 acpi=off
initrd (hd0,1)/boot/initrd.img

title experimental
kernel (hd0,1)/boot/bzImage-2.7.4 root=/dev/hda2 quiet

title dos
root (hd0,4)
makeactive
chainloader +1

</pre></div><h3>Changing options within the boot loader (LILO)
</h3>
 <p>
  Both <code>lilo</code> and <code>grub</code> allow you to pass special parameters to the
  kernel you select.  If you use <code>lilo</code> you may pass boot prompt
  arguments by appending them to your kernel selection.  For example,
  you might type:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>LILO: linux ether=9,0x300,0xd0000 root=/dev/ha2 vga=791 acpi=on

</pre></div><p>
  For a custom boot setting (special options to the ethernet module,
  specify the root partition, choose video mode, etc).  Of course, it is
  not all that friendly, since you need to know the exact options
  available, and type them exactly right.
</p>
<p>
  Of particular importance is the option to change the runlevel from the
  boot loader.  For example, for recovery purposes you may want to run
  in single user mode, which you can do with, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>LILO: experimental single

</pre></div><p>
  Or:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>LILO: linux 1

</pre></div><p>
  Another rather special option is the <code>init=</code> argument that lets you
  use a program other than <code>init</code> as the first process.  An option for a
  fallback situation might be <code>init=/bin/sh</code>, which at least gets you an
  Linux shell if <code>init</code> fails catastrophically.
</p>
<h3>Changing options within the boot loader (GRUB)
</h3>
 <p>
  With <code>grub</code> you have even more flexibility.  In fact, <code>grub</code> is a
  whole basic shell that lets you change boot loader configurations and
  even read filesystems.  For custom boot options, simply press <code>e</code> in
  the <code>grub</code> shell, then add options (such as a numeric runlevel, or the
  keyword "single", as with <code>lilo</code>).  All the other boot prompt
  arguments you might type under <code>lilo</code> can be edited in a <code>grub</code> boot
  command, using simple <code>readlines</code> style editing.
</p>
<p>
  For some real sense of the power, you can open a <code>grub</code> command line.
  For example, suppose you think your <code>/etc/inittab</code> might be
  misconfigured, and you need to examine it before booting.  You might
  type:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>grub&gt; cat (hd0,2)/etc/inittab

</pre></div><p>
  This would let you manually view your initialization without even
  launching any operating system.  If there was a problem there, perhaps
  you would want to boot into single user mode and fix it.
</p>
<h3>Customizing what comes after the boot loader
</h3>
 <p>
  In the main, once you understand the steps in a Linux post-kernel boot
  process (i.e. the <code>init</code> process, and everything it calls), you also
  understand how to customize it.  Basically, customization is just a
  matter of editing <code>/etc/inittab</code> and the various scripts in
  <code>/etc/rc?.d/</code> directories.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I recently needed to customize the video bios on a
  Debian-based Linux laptop using a third-party tool. If this didn't run
  before X11 ran, my XOrg driver would not detect the correct video
  modes. Once I figured out what the issue actually was, the solution is
  as simple as creating the script <code>/etc/rcS.d/S56-resolution.sh</code>. In
  other words, I run an extra script during every system startup.
  Notably, I made sure this ran before <code>/etc/rcS.d/S70xorg-common</code> by
  the simple convention that scripts run in alphabetical order (if I
  wanted it to run later, I might have named it <code>S98-resolution.sh</code>
  instead.  Arguably, I might have put this script only in the
  <code>/etc/rc5.d/</code> directory to run when X11 does--but my way lets me
  manually run <code>startx</code> from other runlevels.
</p>
<p>
  Everthing in the initialization process is out in the open, right in
  the filesystem; and almost all of it is in editable text scripts.
</p>
<h3>System Recovery</h3>
 <h3>About recovery
</h3>
 <p>
  The nicest thing about Linux from a maintenance perspective is that
  everything is a file.  Of course, it can be perplexing at times to
  know <strong>which</strong> file something lives in.  But as a rule, Linux recovery
  amounts to using basic filesystem utilities like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>,
  <code>rm</code>, and a text editor like <code>vi</code>.  Of course, to automate these
  activities, tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>bash</code> are helpful; or at a
  higher level <code>perl</code> or <code>python</code>.  This particular tutorial does not
  address basic file manipulation.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming you know how to manipulate and edit files, the only "gotcha"
  perhaps remaining for a broken system is not being able to use the
  filesystems at all.
</p>
<h3>fsck
</h3>
 <p>
  Your best friend in repairing a broken filesystem is <code>fsck</code>.  Topic
  203 in this series has more information, so we will just introduce the
  tool here.
</p>
<p>
  The tool called <code>fsck</code> is actually just a frontend for a number of
  more narrow <code>fsck.*</code> tools, such as <code>fsck.ext2</code>, <code>fsck.ext3</code> or
  <code>fsck.reiser</code>.  You may specify the type explicitly using the <code>-t</code>
  option, but <code>fsck</code> will make an effort to figure it out on its own.
  Read the manpage for <code>fsck</code> or <code>fsck.*</code> for more details.  The main
  think you want to know is that the <code>-a</code> option will try to fix
  everything it can automatically.
</p>
<p>
  You can check an unmounted filesystem by mentioning its raw device.
  For example: <code>fsck /dev/hda8</code> to check a partition not in use.  You
  can also check a rooted filesystem, such as <code>fsck /home</code>; but
  generally you only want to do that if the filesystem is already
  mounted as read-only, not as read-write.
</p>
<h3>mount and umount
</h3>
 <p>
  A flexible feature of Linux systems is the fine tuned control you have
  over mounting and unmounting filesystems. Unlike under Windows and
  some other operating systems, partitions are not automatically
  assigned locations by the Linux kernel, but are instead attached to
  the single <code>/</code> root hierarchy by the <code>mount</code> command. Moreover,
  different filesystems types (on different drives, even) may be mounted
  within the same hierarchy. Unmounting a particular partition is done
  with the <code>umount</code> command, specifying either the mount point (e.g.
  <code>/home</code>) or the raw device (e.g. <code>/dev/hda7</code>).
</p>
<p>
  For recovery purposes, the ability to control mount points lets you
  perform forensic analysis on partitions--using <code>fsck</code> or other
  tools--without risking further damage to a damaged filesystem. You may
  also custom mount a filesystem using various options; the most
  important of these is mounting read-only using either of the synonyms
  <code>-r</code> or <code>-o ro</code>.
</p>
<p>
  As a quick example, you might wish to substitute one user directory
  location for another, either because of damage to one, or simply to
  expand disk space or move to a faster disk.  You might perform this
  switch using something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre># umount /home      # old /dev/hda7 home dir
# mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 /home  # new SCSI disk using XFS
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda2 /tmp  # also put the /tmp on SCSI

</pre></div><h3>/etc/fstab
</h3>
 <p>
  For recovery, system upgrades, and special purposes, it is useful to
  be able to mount and unmount filesystems at will. But for day-to-day
  operation, you generally want a pretty fixed set of mounts to happen
  at every system boot. You control the mounts that happen at bootup by
  putting configuration lines in the file <code>/etc/fstab</code>. A typical
  configuration might look something like the below example. The Topic
  203 tutorial contains more details.
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>/dev/hda7 / ext3 defaults 1 1
none /dev/pts devpts mode=0620 0 0
/dev/hda9 /home ext3 defaults 1 2
none /mnt/cdrom supermount dev=/dev/hdc,fs=auto,ro,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850,umask=0 0 0
none /mnt/floppy supermount dev=/dev/fd0,fs=auto,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,sync,codepage=850,umask=0 0 0
none /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/hda8 swap swap defaults 0 0
