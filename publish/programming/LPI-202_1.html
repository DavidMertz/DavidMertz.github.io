<blockquote>
    Welcome to "Network Configuration", the first of seven tutorials
    covering intermediate network administration on Linux.  In this
    tutorial, you will learn how to configure a basic TCP/IP network,
    from the hardware layer (usually ethernet, modem, ISDN, or 802.11),
    through the routing of network addresses.  Higher level servers that
    may operate on these configured networks are covered in later
    tutorials.

<h3>Before You Start</h3>
 <h3>About this series
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  </strong> Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  <strong> Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  </strong> Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  <strong> Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  </strong> Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)

<h3>About this tutorial
</h3>
 <p>
  Welcome to "Network Configuration", the first of seven tutorials
  covering intermediate network administration on Linux. In this
  tutorial, you will learn how to configure a basic TCP/IP network, from
  the hardware layer (usually ethernet, modem, ISDN, or 802.11), through
  the routing of network addresses. Higher level servers that may
  operate on these configured networks are covered in later tutorials.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites
</h3>
 <p>
  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.
</p>
<h3>About network configuration
</h3>
 <p>
  <img src="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/network-layers.png" alt="Network layers">
</p>
<p>
  It is useful in thinking about Linux networking, and this network
  configuration tutorial, to keep in mind the OSI seven layer Reference
  Model. What we call "network configuration" essentially lives on the
  second and third layers: <em>Data Link Layer</em> and <em>Network Layer</em>, and in
  the interfaces between them. In practice, this amounts to either
  ethernet or serial interfaces like modems the Data Link Layer, and
  Internet Protocol (IP) for the Network Layer. Later tutorials in this
  series deal with higher level layers, though most server applications
  discussed do not cleanly separate all seven layers (or even the top
  four where they operate)
</p>
<p>
  The first network layer is the <em>Physical Layer</em>: actual wires (or
  wireless channels) and circuits. A practical network administrator
  needs to be ready to inspect cabling and install new network
  peripherals, from time-to-time; but those issues are mostly not in
  scope of these tutorials. Clearly, however, a loose wire, fried
  ethernet card, or broken plug is just as capable of creating network
  problems as is misconfigured software.
</p>
<p>
  Layer 4 is the <em>Transport Layer</em>, which concretely means either TCP or
  UDP in IP networks. TCP and UDP are utilized at higher levels via the
  Berkeley Sockets Interface, which is a well-tested library on all
  modern computer systems. For background on how applications (such as
  those discussed in later tutorials of this series) utilize TCP or UDP

</blockquote>
<h3>Other resources
</h3>
 <p>
  As with most Linux tools, it is always useful to examine the manpages
  for any utilities discussed. Versions and switches might change
  between utility or kernel version, or with different Linux
  distributions. For more in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
 <a href="http://www.tldp.org/.">http://www.tldp.org/.</a>  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's <cite>TCP/IP Network
  Administration</cite>, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).
</p>
<h3>Basic Networking Configuration</h3>
 <h3>Address Resolution Protocol
</h3>
 <p>
  The first thing to understand about ethernet devices, either
  802.11a/b/g wireless or more traditional CAT5/CAT6 wired networks is
  that every ethernet device has a unique six-byte ID in it. Those IDs
  are assigned in blocks to manufacturers, and you can look up the
  assignments at &lt<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers&gt;.">http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers&gt;.</a>
  Ethernet generally "just works" at the hardware level, but a system
  needs to map an ethernet ID to the IP address it will use to enable IP
  networking.
</p>
<p>
  The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) lets machines discover each
  others' IP address within a local ethernet network. ARP, as a
  protocol, is generally implemented within network device drivers
  (kernel modules); the tool <code>arp</code> lets you examine the status of the
  ARP system, and tweak it in some ways.  At this point, we assume that
  each machine has been configured to know its own IP address, either by
  static assignment or dynamically with DHCP.
</p>
<p>
  When a Linux system (or any device with ethernet) wishes to address an
  IP address, the ARP request message, "who is X.X.X.X tell Y.Y.Y.Y" is
  sent using the Ethernet broadcast address. The target system forms an
  ARP response "X.X.X.X is hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh", and sends it to the
  requesting host. An ARP response is cached for a short time in
  <code>/proc/net/arp</code> to avoid the need to continually reestablish the
  mapping between hardware ethernet addresses and IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
  A nice description of ARP can be found at
  &lt<a href="http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/inet-pages/arp.html&gt;.">http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/inet-pages/arp.html&gt;.</a>
</p>
<h3>The <code>arp</code> utility
</h3>
 <p>
  The Linux utility <code>arp</code> lets you examine and modify the status of ARP
  mappings.  A simple status report might look like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>ARP status report</h4><pre>
$ arp -n
Address          HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask    Iface
192.168.2.1      ether   00:03:2F:09:61:C7   C             eth0

</pre></div><p>
  This tells you the specific hardware device assigned to IP address
  192.168.2.1 on this network (the number used is suggestive of a
  router/gateway, which indeed it is in this case).  The fact that only
  this single mapping is listed does not necessarily mean that no other
  devices exist on the local network, but simply that the ARP records
  for other devices have expired.  ARP expires records after a short
  time--on the order of minutes, rather than seconds or hours--to allow
  networks to reconfigure themselves if hosts are added or removed, or
  if settings are changed on machines.  By caching for an ARP record for
  a short time, a new request should not be necessary during most
  client/server application sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Any sort of IP request on a host that may be on the local network
  causes the kernel to send out an ARP request, and if an ARP reply is
  received, add the host to the ARP cache.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Interacting with additional IP addresses</h4><pre>
$ ping -c 1 192.168.2.101 &gt; /dev/null
$ ping -c 1 192.168.2.101 &gt; /dev/null
$ ping -c 1 192.168.2.102 &gt; /dev/null
$ ping -c 1 192.168.32.32 &gt; /dev/null
$ ping -c 1 192.168.32.32 &gt; /dev/null
$ arp -n
Address          HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask    Iface
192.168.2.1      ether   00:03:2F:09:61:C7   C             eth0
192.168.2.101    ether   00:30:65:2C:01:11   C             eth0
192.168.2.100    ether   00:11:24:9D:1E:4B   C             eth0
192.168.2.102    ether   00:48:54:83:82:AD   C             eth0

</pre></div><p>
  In this case, the first four addresses really exist on the local
  ethernet network, but 192.168.32.32 does not, and so no ARP reply is
  received.  Notice also that addresses you may succeed in connecting to
  via non-local routing will also not cause anything to be added to the
  ARP cache.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ ping -c 1 google.com
PING google.com (216.239.57.99) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 216.239.57.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=235 time=109 ms
--- google.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 109.123/109.123/109.123/0.000 ms
$ arp -n
Address          HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask    Iface
192.168.2.1      ether   00:03:2F:09:61:C7   C             eth0

</pre></div><p>
  Google is <em>reachable</em> (because routing is already configured), but
  216.239.57.99 is non-local and is not added to ARP.
</p>

</p>
<h3>PPP, PAP and CHAP
</h3>
 <p>
  Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used to establish internet links over
  dial-up modems, direct serial connections, DSL, and other types of
  point-to-point links, including sometimes as PPPoE (as a "pseudo-layer
  over ethernet). The <code>pppd</code> daemon works together with the kernel PPP
  driver to establish and maintain a PPP link with another system
  (called the peer) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
  for each end of the link.
</p>
<p>
  PPP, specifically <code>pppd</code> authenticate its peer and/or supply
  authentication information to the peer.  Such authentication is
  performed using either the simple password system Password
  Authentication Protocol (PAP) or the per-session Challenge Handshake
  Authentication Protocol (CHAP).  Of the two, CHAP is more secure if
  both ends support it.
</p>
<p>
  Options for PPP in general are stored in <code>/etc/ppp/options</code>.
  Configuration of PAP is via the "PAP secrets" file
  <code>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</code>, and for "CHAP secrets,"
  <code>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</code>.
</p>
<h3>The PAP/CHAP secrets file
</h3>
 <p>
  The <code>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</code> file contains white space separated field
  for client, server, secret, and "acceptable local IP address".  The
  last may be blank (and generally is for dynamic IP allocation).  The
  PAP secrets file should be configured correspondingly for each peer.
  Even though PPP is a peer protocol, for connection purposes we call
  the requesting machine the client, and the waiting machine the server
  for configuration purposes.  So, for example, the machine <code>bacchus</code> on
  my network might have a configuration like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets on bacchus</h4><pre>
# Every regular user can use PPP and uses passwords from /etc/passwd
# INBOUND connections
# client   server  secret            acceptable local IP addresses
*          bacchus ""                *
chaos      bacchus chaos-password
# OUTBOUND connections
bacchus      *     bacchus-password

</pre></div><p>
  Machine <code>bacchus</code> will accept connections claiming to be any regular
  user, or also claiming to be machine <code>chaos</code> (and demanding the
  password "chaos-password" in the latter case).  To other machines,
  <code>bacchus</code> will simply use its own name, and offer the password
  "bacchus-password" to every peer.
</p>
<p>
  Correspondingly, the machine <code>chaos</code> on my network might have:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets on chaos</h4><pre>
# client   server  secret            acceptable local IP addresses
chaos      bacchus chaos-password
bacchus    chaos   bacchus-password

</pre></div><p>
  Machine <code>chaos</code> is more conservative in whom it will connect to.  It
  is only willing to exchange credentials with <code>bacchus</code>.  You may
  configure each <code>/etc/ppp/options</code> file to decide if credentials are
  demanded though.
</p>
<p>
  Using CHAP secrets requires that you allow for both peer machines to
  authenticate each other.  As long as bidirection authentication is
  configued in PAP secrets, a CHAP secrets file may look just the same
  as the above examples.
</p>
<h3>Connecting with mgetty
</h3>
 <p>
  The PAP secrets file can be used with the AUTO_PPP function of mgetty.
  <code>mgetty</code> 0.99+ is preconfigured to startup <code>pppd</code> with the "login"
  option. This tells <code>pppd</code> to consult /etc/passwd (and /etc/shadow in
  turn) after a user has passed this file.
</p>
<p>
  In general, a <code>getty</code> program may be configured to allow connections
  from serial devices, including modems and direct serial ports. For
  example, for a hard-wired line or a console tty, you might run:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>/sbin/getty 9600 ttyS1

</pre></div><p>
  in your <code>inittab</code>. For a old style dial-in line with a 9600/2400/1200
  baud modem:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>/sbin/getty -mt60 ttyS1 9600,2400,1200

</pre></div><h3>Configuring routing
</h3>
 <p>
  In the discussion of Address Resolution Protocol, we saw how IP
  addresses are assigned within a local network.  However, to
  communicate with machines outside of a local network, it is necessary
  to have a <em>gateway/router</em>.  Basically, a gateway is simply a machine
  that connects to more than one network, and can therefore take
  packets transmitted within one network, and re-transmit them on other
  networks it is connected to.  This is where the name "internet" comes
  with: it is a "network of networks", in which every gateway can
  eventually reach every other network said to be "on the internet."
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial in this series, Topic 210: Network Client Management,
  discusses DHCP, which will assign both client IP addresses and gateway
  address. However, with a fixed IP address on a client, or in debugging
  situations, the Linux command <code>route</code> allows you to view and modify
  routing tables. The newer command <code>ip</code> also lets you modify routing
  tables, using a somewhat more powerful syntax. A routing table simply
  lets you determine which gateway or host to send a packet to, given a
  specific pattern in the address. And address pattern is specified by
  combining an address with a <em>subnet mask</em>. A subnet mask is a bit
  pattern, usually represented in dotted quad notation, that tell the
  kernel which bits of a destination to treat as the <em>network address</em>,
  and which remaining bits to treat as a <em>subnet</em>.  The command <code>ip</code> can
  accept the simpler <code>/NN</code> format for bitmasks.  In general, in a mask
  and address, zero bits are "wildcards".
</p>
<p>
  For example, a simple network with a single external gateway is likely
  to have a routing table similar to:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Typical simple routing table</h4><pre>
$ route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination  Gateway      Genmask        Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.2.0  0.0.0.0      255.255.255.0  U     0      0     0 eth0
0.0.0.0      192.168.2.1  0.0.0.0        UG    0      0     0 eth0

</pre></div><p>
  What this means is simply that any IP address that matches
  "192.168.2.*" is on the local network, and will be delivered directly
  to the proper host (resolved with ARP).  Any other address will be
  sent to the gateway "192.168.2.1", which will be required to forward a
  packet appropriately.  The machine 192.168.2.1 must be connected to
  one or more external networks.
</p>
<p>
  However, for a more complex case you may route specific patterns
  differently.  In an invented example, let us say that you wish to
  route specific <code>/16</code> addresses through other gateways.  You might use:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Changing routing on /16 networks</h4><pre>
$ route add -net 216.109.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.2.2
$ route add -net 216.239.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.2.3
$ route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination  Gateway      Genmask        Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
192.168.2.0  0.0.0.0      255.255.255.0  U     0      0     0 eth0
216.109.0.0  192.168.2.2  255.255.0.0    UG    0      0     0 eth0
216.239.0.0  192.168.2.3  255.255.0.0    UG    0      0     0 eth0
0.0.0.0      192.168.2.1  0.0.0.0        UG    0      0     0 eth0

</pre></div><p>
  Addresses of the form "216.109.*" and "216.239.* will now be routed
  through the gateways 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.2.3, respectively (both
  on the local network themselves).  Addresses that are local or outside
  the pattern spaces given, will be routed as before.  The command
  <code>route delete</code> may be used correspondingly to remove routes.
</p>
<h3>Advanced Networking Configuration And Troubleshooting</h3>
 <h3>About network utilities
</h3>
 <p>
  Linux comes with a number of standard utilities you will want to be
  familiar with in customizing and troubleshooting a network
  configuration.  Although much of Linux networking code lives in the
  kernel itself, almost everything about the behavior of networks is
  configurable using command-line utilities.  Many distributions also
  come with higher level and/or graphical high-level configuration
  tools, but those do not contain anything that can not be peformed and
  scripted using the command-line tools.
</p>
<h3>The <code>ping</code> utility
</h3>
 <p>
  The most basic way of checking whether a Linux host has access to an
  IP address (or once DNS and/or <code>/etc/hosts</code> is configured, to a named
  host) is with the utility <code>ping</code>.  <code>ping</code> operates at the basic IP
  layer, it does not rely on data link layer like TCP or IP, but instead
  uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  If you cannot
  reach a host with <code>ping</code>, you can assume you will not reach it with
  any other tool, so <code>ping</code> is always the first step in establishing
  whether a connection to a host is available.  See <code>man ping</code> for
  details on options.  By default <code>ping</code> sends a message every one second
  until cancelled, but you may change timings, limit message count, and
  change output details.  When run, <code>ping</code> returns some details on
  round trip time and dropped packages, but for the most part either you
  can ping a host or you cannot.  Some examples:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Local and non-local ping examples</h4><pre>
$ ping -c 2 -i 2 google.com
PING google.com (216.239.37.99): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 216.239.37.99: icmp_seq=0 ttl=237 time=43.861 ms
64 bytes from 216.239.37.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=237 time=36.956 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 36.956/40.408/43.861 ms

$ ping 192.168.2.102
PING 192.168.2.102 (192.168.2.102): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.102: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=4.64 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.102: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=2.176 ms
^C
--- 192.168.2.102 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 2.176/3.408/4.64 ms

</pre></div><h3>The <code>ifconfig</code> utility
</h3>
 <p>
  Network interfaces are configured with the tool <code>ifconfig</code>.  Usually
  this is run as part of the initialization process, but interfaces may
  be modified and tuned later, in some cases (especially for debugging).
  If run with no switches, <code>ifconfig</code> displays the current status.  You
  may use the forms <code>ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; up</code> and <code>ifconfig &lt;interface&gt;
  down</code> to start and stop network interfaces.  Some other switches
  change the display or limit the display to specific interfaces.  See
  <code>man ifconfig</code> for more details.
</p>
<p>
  An informational display might look something like:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Using ifconfig to examine network interfaces</h4><pre>
$ ifconfig
eth0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:12:F0:21:4C:F8
      inet addr:192.168.2.103  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

</pre></div><p>
  In this display, two networks are configured, one on ethernet, one on
  PPP (plus the local loopback).  In other case, you might have multiple
  ethernet interfaces configured, or other interface types.  If so, the
  system is called <em>multi-homed</em>.
</p>
<h3>The <code>netstat</code> utility
</h3>
 <p>
  With Linux utilities, there tends to be a fair overlap in
  functionality. The tool <code>netstat</code> displays information that may also
  be provided by several utilities, such as <code>ifconfig</code> and <code>route</code>.  You
  may also find extensive general statistics on network activity.  For
  example:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4>Network statistics report</h4><pre>
$ netstat -s
Ip:
    12317 total packets received
    0 forwarded
    0 incoming packets discarded
    12255 incoming packets delivered
    11978 requests sent out
Icmp:
    1 ICMP messages received
    0 input ICMP message failed.
    ICMP input histogram:

</pre></div><h3>Other utilties: <code>tcpdump</code>, <code>lsof</code>, <code>nc</code> (<code>netcat</code>)
</h3>
 <p>
  There are several other utilities you should be aware of for network
  configuration. As usual, their respective manpages contain full usage
  information. Detailed discussion of these is contained later in this
  tutorial series, in Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
  <code>tcpdump</code> lets you monitor all the packets that pass through network
  interfaces, optionally limited to particular interfaces or filtered on
  various criteria.  Often saving this packet summary information, then
  filtering or summarizing it with text processing tools, is useful for
  debugging network problem.  For example, you can examing packets
  communicated with a particular remote host.
</p>
<p>
  <code>lsof</code> lists open files on a running Linux system.  But in particular,
  you may use the <code>lsof -i</code> option to examine only the pseudo-files for
  a particular IP connection, or for network connections in general.
  E.g.:
</p>
<div class="code-sample"><h4></h4><pre>$ lsof -i
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE
        NAME
vino-serv 7812  dqm   33u  IPv4  12824
        TCP *:5900 (LISTEN)
gnome-cup 7832  dqm   18u  IPv4  12865
        TCP localhost.localdomain:32771-&gt;localhost.localdomain:ipp (ESTABLISHED)
telnet    8909  dqm    3u  IPv4  15771
        TCP 192.168.2.103:32777-&gt;192.168.2.102:telnet (ESTABLISHED)

</pre></div><p>
  <code>nc</code> and <code>netcat</code> are aliases. <code>netcat</code> is a simple unix utility which
  reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP
  protocol. It is a "back-end" tool that can be used directly or driven
  by other programs and scripts.  In many respects <code>netcat</code> is similar
  to <code>telnet</code>, but it is more versatile in allowing UDP interaction, and
  sending unfiltered binary data.
