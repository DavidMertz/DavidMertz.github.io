    RELAX NG Schemas provide a more powerful, more concise, and
    semantically more straightforward means of describing classes
    of valid XML instances than do W3C XML Schemas.  This
    installment continues the discussion of RELAX NG begun in the
    last one, addresses a few addition semantic issues, and looks
    at tools for working with RELAX NG.

MORE SEMANTIC ISSUES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The last installment gave readers a fairly complete overview of
  both the syntax and semantics of RELAX NG schemas.  However, a
  few issues were glossed over, and are worth touching on.

  Both DTDs and W3C XML Schemas allow for -infoset augmentation-,
  while RELAX NG does not.  James Clark--one of the creators of
  RELAX NG (and of many widely used XML tools)--argues vehemently
  that infoset augmentation violates modularity in the roles of
  XML instance documents and schemata.  In other words, for
  Clark, RELAX NG has a feature where DTDs and W3C Schemas have a
  bug.  My own feelings on the matter are mixed, but I can get
  his intuition.

  Let us backtrack a little and explain what this infoset stuff
  is about.  Basically, we can ask of an XML instance what data
  it contains.  If we parse the instance without validation, the
  answer depends on nothing other than what values occur in its
  attributes and element bodies.  If we value modularity, a
  schema should only tell us whether an instance is valid or not,
  it should not change that actually -information- in a document.
  However, such modularity is violated if we use a DTD or W3C XML
  Schema for validation.  For example, consider the following
  DTD:

      #--------------------- curious.dtd -----------------------#
      <!ELEMENT foo EMPTY>
      <!ATTLIST foo bar CDATA "curious"
                    baz CDATA #FIXED "curiouser">

  And the XML instance:

      #--------------------- curious.xml -----------------------#
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "curious.dtd">
      <foo/>

  A non-validating parser finds a different set of information in
  this document than a validating parser. Contrast the
  non-validating utility 'xmlcat' with the validating '4xml'
  (both echo whatever they "see" back to the console):

      % ./xmlcat curious.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
      <foo></foo>
      % 4xml -p curious.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <foo bar="curious" baz="curiouser"/>

  An W3C Schema allows 'default' and 'fixed' attributes to have
  similar effects for both '<xsd:attribute>' and '<xsd:element>'
  tags.

  The argument in favor of defaulting is that it allows XML
  instance minimization. I have used defaults (or more likely
  '#FIXED' attributes) for this very purpose. But I can also see
  dangers--both of malice and of debugging nightmares--in the idea
  that the very content of a local XML document depends on a remote
  URI (perhaps spoofable), and even upon an absence of network
  interruptions during parsing.

  In any case, RELAX NG does not peform any infoset augementation.
  Well, almost; I think Clark overstates this point. If you impose
  a datatype on an element or attribute, you still change the
  content of the value in an important way. The value of the string
  "1.0" is different from the value of the float 1.0, even though
  the two are represented in exactly the same way in an XML
  instance.

STATING CARDINALITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Basically, W3C XML Schemas have better means of requiring
  occurrence cardinalities than do DTDs or RELAX NG schemas. If you
  want a '<foo>' element to occur between 5 and 30 times within the
  '<bar>' element, you can decare this in W3C Schemas with a
  straightforward:

      #------------ W3C XML Schema cardinality rule ------------#
      <xsd:element name="bar">
        <xsd:element name="foo" minOccurs="5" maxOccurs="30"/>
      </xsd:element>

  The same cardinality rule -can- be stated in a DTD, but -very-
  clumsily:

      #----------------- DTD cardinality rule ------------------#
      <!ELEMENT bar
          (foo, foo, foo, foo, foo, foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?
           foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?
           foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?,foo?) >

  What I would like for RELAX NG would be an explicit
  '<cardinality>' tag, so that you could (hypothetically) write
  something like:

      #-------- Imagined RELAX NG 2.0 cardinality rule ---------#
      <element name="bar" xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0>
        <cardinality min="5" max="30">
          <element name="foo"/>
        </cardinality>
      </element>

  Unfortunately, in the actually existing RELAX NG, the only
  cardinalities you get are '<zeroOrMore>', '<oneOrMore>', and
  '<optional>'.  However, named patterns can at least be used to
  make spelling out cardinalities slightly less painful.  In
  compact syntax, for example:

      #---- Actual RELAX NG compact syntax cardinality rule ----#
      start = element bar { fivefoo, upto25foo }
      fivefoo = element foo { empty }, element foo { empty },
                element foo { empty }, element foo { empty },
                element foo { empty }
      maybefoo = element foo { empty }?
      upto25foo =
        fivefoo?, fivefoo?, fivefoo?, fivefoo?,
        maybefoo, maybefoo, maybefoo, maybefoo, maybefoo

  I confess that this sort of naming is not perfect, but at least
  it is possible to name large numbers by effectively raising to
  powers though repetition of named patterns.

TRANSFORMATIONS AND VALIDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a variety of tools available for working with RELAX NG
  schemas. Java is the language in which these tools are
  predominantly implemented, but some tools/libraries have been
  written in in Python, C#, Visual Basic. Surprisingly, I have not
  found any libraries written in other languages that would seem to
  be good fits: Perl, Ruby, C/C++.

  One obvious class of RELAX NG application is validators.  Just
  as with validating parsers that work with DTDs or W3C XML
  Schemas, a number of command-line, online, or library parsers
  are available for RELAX NG.  A slightly less obvious class of
  application is tools to transform schemata into each other.
  Sun's RELAX NG Converter and James Clark's [trang] and
  [DTDinst] let you convert among RELAX NG (XML and compact
  syntax), DTDs, and W3C XML Schemas.  I plan to write a less
  ambitious Python tool 'compact2xml.py' in time for the next
  installment, which will allow [4Suite] and [xvif] to utilize
  RELAX NG compact syntax (both authors have expressed an
  interest in including such a tool).

  It is worth looking at tranformations in a bit more detail.
  The first installment in this sequence looked at ways in which
  RELAX NG is strictly more powerful than W3C XML Schemas, and
  looking at some "best effort" transformations help illustrate
  this point.  For example, the previous installment presented a
  schema for a library patron, which is expressed in compact
  syntax as:

      #-------------- Libary Patron Compact Syntax--------------#
      element patron {
        element name { text }   &
        element id-num { text } &
        element book {
          attribute isbn { text } |
          attribute title { text }
        }*
      }

  See the first part for the XML syntax version, which is
  semantically identical, albeit more verbose.  [trang] make a
  good effort at turning this into a W3C XML Schema.  The file
  extensions of the input and output file are used to guess types
  (or may be overridden with switches):

      #------- Transforming RELAX NG to W3C XML Schema ---------#
      % java -jar trang.jar patron.rnc patron.xsd
      % cat patron.xsd
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <xsd:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                 elementFormDefault="qualified" version="1.0">
        <xsd:element name="patron">
          <xsd:complexType>
            <xsd:choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
              <xsd:element ref="name"/>
              <xsd:element ref="id-num"/>
              <xsd:element ref="book"/>
            </xsd:choice>
          </xsd:complexType>
        </xsd:element>
        <xsd:element name="name">
          <xsd:complexType mixed="true"/>
        </xsd:element>
        <xsd:element name="id-num">
          <xsd:complexType mixed="true"/>
        </xsd:element>
        <xsd:element name="book">
          <xsd:complexType>
            <xsd:attribute name="isbn"/>
            <xsd:attribute name="title"/>
          </xsd:complexType>
        </xsd:element>
      </xsd:schema>

  To the credit of [trang], I think this W3C Schema is genuinely
  the best that can be done for the situation.  -Every- XML
  instance accepted by the RELAX NG schema is also accepted by
  the W3C XML Schema, and many errors are rejected by both.  The
  problem is, that there is a distinct class of XML instances
  that are not -really- valid according to our desired rule, but
  that pass validation with the W3C Schema.  For example:

      #---------- Limits of W3C XML Schema discernment ---------#
      % cat patron-i1.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <patron>
        <book isbn="0-528-84460-X"/>
        <name>John Doe</name>    <!-- repeats name subelement -->
        <name>Second Name</name>
        <id-num>12345678</id-num>
        <book title="Why RELAX is Clever"/>
      </patron>
      % cat patron-i2.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <patron>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <id-num>12345678</id-num>
        <!-- Too many and too few attributes of book element -->
        <book title="Why RELAX is Clever" isbn="0-528-84460-X"/>
        <book/>
      </patron>
      % cat patron-i3.xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <patron/>        <!-- No required subelements -->

  Of course, even though the above three examples falsely
  validate, W3C XML Schema will still reject XML instances with
  entirely disallowed elements/attributes, or ones that nest
  elements in improper ways (e.g. '<book>' inside '<name>'
  rather than as a sibling).

  As far as validation tools go, I find that [jing] does a good
  job of producing useful error messages when validation fails.
  The Python XML library [4Suite] encorporates a version of the
  [xvif] library, and also performs validation (the latter is
  also accessible online, see Resources).  But compare the
  errors:

      #-------- Validation error messages with jing ------------#
      % java -jar ../trang/jing.jar patron.rng patron-i3.xml
      Error at URL "file:/.../patron-i3.xml",
      line number 2: unfinished element
      % java -jar ../trang/jing.jar patron.rng patron-i1.xml
      Error at URL "file:/.../patron-i1.xml",
      line number 5: element "name" not allowed in this context

      #-------- Validation error messages with 4Suite ----------#
      % 4xml --rng=patron.rng patron-i1.xml
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
        File "/.../site-packages/Ft/Xml/_4xml.py", line 89, in Run
          raise RngInvalid(result)
      Ft.Xml.Xvif.RngInvalid: Qname {None}name not exected
      % 4xml --rng=patron.rng patron-i3.xml
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      Ft.Xml.Xvif.RngInvalid

  Of course, in an application context, the choice of the
  programming language that will utilize the libraries outweighs
  differences in produced messages.

COMPILED VALIDATORS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A category of tool that I have not seen much of outside of RELAX
  NG contexts is a single-schema validator. Take a look at the
  RELAX NG home page for links to such tools, including [Bali],
  [RelaxNGCC].  These frameworks will automatically emit code for
  specialized validation of a particular RELAX NG schema.
  Presumably, such a specialized validator will run faster than a
  general purpose one.  The reason such tools are possible--or at
  least much more straightforward than the same thing would be
  relative to W3C XML Schemas--is because the design of RELAX NG
  is extremely well grounded in algorithmic analysis.

RELAX NG ENHANCED XML EDITORS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Unfortunately, XML editors do not yet support RELAX NG as
  widely as they do W3C XML Schemas.  Of course, DTDs remain much
  more widely supported than either of other schema style.  A
  shame in this is that it would actually be far -easier- to
  include customizations around RELAX NG in an editor because of
  the simple conceptual framework of RELAX NG validation.
  Ideally, a custom XML editor would utilize a RELAX NG schema to
  direct and assist a user in the insertion of attributes and
  elements in ways that maintain validity.

  A compromise for the moment could be to use a tool like [trang]
  to convert a RELAX NG schema into a W3C XML Schema or DTD that
  approximates it, then use those within a GUI XML editor.  But
  doing that would help only to a limited extent.

  There is one XML editor built around RELAX NG that is mentioned
  on the RELAX NG home page.  It is called XML Operator, and is a
  Java based tool.  I played with the editor a small amount, and
  found that it could be potentially useful.  But XML Operator
  falls on the low end of the XML editors I have previously
  reviewed, implementing just a few features here and there,
  providing neither the huge array of tools of XML-Spy, or the
  simple elegance of oXygen.  I suppose XML Operator is
  comparable to EditML Pro or XMLWriter (but XML Operator is Free
  Software, which is a plus).

UNTIL NEXT TIME
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The last two installments have looked at most of the elements
  of RELAX NG, including a summary of tools for working with it.
  The next installment will touch briefly on how RELAX NG lets
  you include external schemas in your schema, and selectively
  merge the specifications of different schemas.  But in main,
  the final installment of this sequence will look at the RELAX
  NG compact syntax in some more detail, and explain the exact
  correspondences between compact syntax and XML syntax.


RESOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The home page for RELAX NG is at the below URL.  This website
  contains numerous useful links to links, articles, tools, and
  so on.  Of particular note is the excellent tutorial written by
  two great luminaries of XML technologies, James Clark and
  Murata Makoto.

    http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/

  James Clark wrote a discussion of the algorithmic principles
  behind RELAX NG validation. Interestingly, his sample code is
  provided in Haskell, which has some advantages I have described
  in my _XML Matters_ installment on the [HaXml] library:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/derivative.html

  An online tool to validate an XML instance document against a
  RELAX NG shcema is at the following URL. A RELAX NG schema itself
  is validated during the process, as well. This tool is based on
  Eric van der Vlist's [xvif] tool, written in Python:

    http://downloads.xmlschemata.org/python/xvif/tryMe.cgi?testCase=013

  The above online RELAX NG validator lets you select from a set
  of test cases, as well as check your own examples.  The set of
  test cases provided are also available (and briefly discussed)
  at:

    http://downloads.xmlschemata.org/python/xvif/tests/iframe/strawman/

  The [xvif] library itself can be downloaded from:

    http://downloads.xmlschemata.org/python/

  However, [4Suite] is a somewhat more polished tool that
  incorporates [xvif] for RELAX NG validation.  The command-line
  tool '4xml' will validate against both RELAX NG and DTDs, with
  various options.  [4Suite] includes many other tools and
  libraries for working with many XML-related technologies:

    http://4suite.org/?xslt=downloads.xslt

  For background and comparison, an online tool to validate an XML
  instance document against a W3C XML Schema can be found at:

    http://tools.decisionsoft.com/schemaValidate.html

  Also, an online tool to check W3C XML Schemas against the
  Approved Recommendation:

    http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv

  The tools [trang] and [jing] are complementary tools for
  transformation between schemata and validation against RELAX NG
  schemas.  The former depends on the latter, but both can be
  downloaded in a convenient archive from:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html

  You will need to optain an implementation of the Java API for
  XML Processing (JAXP) to use [trang].  If you run a Java 1.4
  JVM, you are fine already; otherwise, obtain [crimson] at:

    http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson/

  Sun's RELAX NG Converter utilizes Sun's Multi-Schema Validator
  (MSV) to accomplish the same purpose as [trang].  See:

    http://wwws.sun.com/software/xml/developers/relaxngconverter/

  [DTDinst] is a Java tool to convert DTDs into an XML instance
  document format, including handling of parametric entities:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/dtdinst/

  The [DTDinst] XML format is of limited utility by itself, since
  nothing else works with it.  However, an XSLT stylesheet is
  available to transform this format into RELAX NG (with a few
  caveats).  You will need an XSLT tool to utilize this:

    http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/dtdinst/dtdinst2rng.xsl

  the library patron example discussed in this article can be
