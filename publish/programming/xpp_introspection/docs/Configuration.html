   <P class="indent">
   The function Configuration() returns the class object of the
   Configuration class.

<H2>Description</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   The Configuration class provides a means of bundling together all
   the data associated with configurable aspects of modules.  As well,
   the class provides mechanisms for persistent storage of its instances
   via serialization and diskfile storage.  As an adjunct to the
   persistence mechanism, the Configuration class has methods for
   handling the anticipatable event that the Configuration class is
   updated, which would cause the library version to differ from
   previously stored persistent instances.

   <P class="indent">
   The canonical method of accessing an instance of the Configuration
   class is via the Library Cfg() function (See the "Life Cycle" section
   of this page, and the Cfg() function documentation).

   <P class="indent">
   Each instance of the Configuration class contains a member :version
   that is used to indicate the currentness of the (possibly persistent)
   instance.  The methods :uptoDate(), :verUpdate() and :antiquated()
   utilize the :version instance data member for comparison with the
   class :C_version data member

   <P class="indent">
   The Configuration instance member :savedCfg is always initialized as
   false; by definition, at time of creation an instance has not been
   read from persistent storage.  The only action that can change the
   value of :savedCfg is reading back a serialized instance with the
   :fromDisk() method.  The :toDisk() does not modify the value of
   :savedCfg (however, an instance serialized by :toDisk() will not
   normally become a runtime instance except when instantiated with
   :fromDisk()).

   <P class="indent">
   The Configuration class supports introspection via the standard data
   members :_data and :_methods.

<H2>Class Data</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   The class data associated with persistence and versioning is
   declared in the parent class Persistent.  See its documentation
   for details on those data members.

<H2>Class Methods</H2>

   <DL>
   <DT><A HREF="Configuration_new.html"><b>:new()</b></A>
   <DD>Creates an instance of the Configuration class.

   <DT><b>:exposeSelf()</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>When implemented in a child class (of Persistent), :exposeSelf()
       is responsible for setting the child class' introspection and
       version data. All of the exposable data and method members <u>of
       the child</u> should be listed in :C_data and :C_methods,
       respectively. However, the exposed members declared in Class
       Persistent itself, will be added to the introspection data by
       :exposeParent().

   <DT><b>:initClass()</b>
   <DD>Initializes class data to default values.  By contract with its
       parent, Persistent, :initClass() must call ::exposeSelf(), then
       ::exposeParent()
   </DL>

<H2>Life Cycle</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   A Configuration instance comes into existence immediately upon its
   assignment with the Configuration():new() method.  No seperate
   :create() method is required to request system resources.

   <P class="indent">
   A Configuration instance is destroyed when its variable falls out of
   its declaration scope.  In principle, the variable containing a
   Configuration instance can be declared LOCAL to a function, and
   the exit condition of the controlling function will preform all
   necessary destruction of the instance.

   <P class="indent">
   However, in practical use, each module will access a single STATIC
   instance of the Configuration class via the Cfg() function.  The
   instance managed by the Cfg() function is self-initializing and will
   de-serialize itself from diskfile if one is available.  In other
   words, the Cfg() function can be treated as a globally available and
   persistent Configuration instance.

   <P class="indent">
   While the Cfg() function's Configuration instance will de-serialize
   itself from diskfile automatically, it will only be serialized
   with calls to the :toDisk() method.  When changes are made to
   Configuration data that the programmers desires to be persistent,
   it is necessary to "commit" the changes with the :toDisk() method.


<H2>Instance Data</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   The instance data associated with persistence and versioning is
   declared in the parent class Persistent.  See its documentation
   for details on those data members.

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:Font_Alert</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Character ("10.Arial")] </em>
   <DD>What font to use in Alert/Inform dialogs?

   <DT><b>:ButtonLabels</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Boolean (.F.)] </em>
   <DD>Display text labels on (most) buttons?

   <DT><b>:GrayBar</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Boolean (.F.)] </em>
   <DD>Display an "Outlook-style" gray bar with screen title?

   <DT><b>:ColorScheme</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Object (ColorScheme():new())]</em>
   <DD>What color scheme to use? Since the :ColorScheme data member is
       itself an object, it will usually be necessary to refer to the
       nested data or methods of this data.  E.g.
       oCfg:ColorScheme:Titlebar

   <DT><b>:MY_Date</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Date (DATE())]</em>
   <DD>What posting date to use in entry? See Functions PostDate()
       and Change_Postdate() also.

   </DL>

<H2>Instance Methods</H2>

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:init()</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Set introspection data members and default values for exposed
       data members (see Class method :new() for a discussion of the
       special initializiation procedure of this class)

   <DT><b>:toDisk(&lt;cFile&gt;)</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Writes a serialized copy of the instance to a diskfile.  If no
       parameter is passed as a filename specification, the file
       MY_HOMEPATH+"USER.CFG" is used.

   <DT><b>:fromDisk(&lt;cFile&gt;)</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Reads a serialized copy of a Configuration instance from diskfile.
       (if possible).  If no file is specified, or if the file specified
       does not exist, ::savedCfg is simply set to .F., and a reference
       to the original instance is returned.  Otherwise, the serialized
       data is read in, ::savedCfg is set to .T., and the read instance
       is returned.

       <P>
       Since XBase++ does not allow redefinition of self, the methods
       :fromDisk() and :verUpdate() return the modified Configuration
       instance, but do not update the existing instance in-place.

   <DT><b>:antiquated()</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Return a character string report of the differences (if any)
       between the calling instance's and the Class' introspection data
       and version number.

   <DT><b>:verUpdate()</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Returns an updated copy of an instance.  Any data members of the
       current Class' instrospection data that are also present in the
       instance are copied into a new instance of the Configuration class.
       All other data members, and all methods, are defined according
       to the definition and initialization values of the most current
       version.

       <P>
       Two data members, however, will be given Library/Class default
       values rather than the values existing in the calling instance.
       These are :version, which is not changed because all
       version-specific structure is updated in the returned instance; and
       :ColorScheme, which reinitialized under the (paranoid) assumption
       that the Class ColorScheme might have changed structure also.

       <P>
       Since XBase++ does not allow redefinition of self, the methods
       :fromDisk() and :verUpdate() return the modified Configuration
       instance, but do not update the existing instance in-place.

   <DT><b>:uptoDate()</b> <em>[implementation]</em>
   <DD>Returns a boolean value indicating whether the calling instance
       is current with the Class definition in the Library.

   </DL>
