<H1>ABSTRACT CLASS Persistent</H1>

   <P class="synopsis">
   Framework for child class serialization, storage and versioning

<!----------------------------------------------------------------><HR>

<H2>Sub classes</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   <A HREF="Configuration.html">Configuration</A>

<H2>Return</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   The function Persistent() returns the class object of the
   Persistent class.

<H2>Description</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   Each instance of a child of the Persistent class contains a member
   :version that is used to indicate the currentness of the (possibly
   persistent) instance.  The methods :uptoDate(), :verUpdate() and
   :antiquated() utilize the :version instance data member for
   comparison with the class :C_version data member

   <P class="indent">
   The Persistent-child instance member :savedCfg is always initialized
   as false; by definition, at time of creation an instance has not been
   read from persistent storage.  The only action that can change the
   value of :savedCfg is reading back a serialized instance with the
   :fromDisk() method.  The :toDisk() does not modify the value of
   :savedCfg (however, an instance serialized by :toDisk() will not
   normally become a runtime instance except when instantiated with
   :fromDisk()).

   <P class="indent">
   The Persistent class supports the framework for introspection via the
   standard data members :_data and :_methods.  However, since
   Persistent cannot itself be instantiated, it cannot expose instance
   introspection.

<H2>Class Data</H2>

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:C_data</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Array (member data list)]</em>
   <DD>Introspection data for curent child class of Persistent class in
       the library. This data might differ from the introspection data
       of a persistent (serialized) Persistent instance.

   <DT><b>:C_methods</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Array (member methods list)]</em>
   <DD>Introspection data for curent child class of Persistent class in
       the library. This data might differ from the introspection data
       of a persistent (serialized) Persistent instance.

   <DT><b>:C_version</b> <em>[EXPORTED READONLY; Numeric (version number)]</em>
   <DD>Version number of current child class of Persistent class in the
       library This version number might differ from the introspection
       data of a persistent (serialized) Persistent instance.
   </DL>

<H2>Class Methods</H2>

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:exposeSelf()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em>
   <DD>When implemented in a child class, :exposeSelf() is responsible
       for setting the child class' introspection and version data.
       All of the exposable data and method members <u>of the child</u>
       should be listed in :C_data and :C_methods, respectively.
       However, the exposed members declared in Class Persistent
       itself, will be added to the introspection data by :exposeParent().

   <DT><b>:exposeParent()</b>
   <DD>Add the exposable members of Persistent to child class'
       introspection data members :C_data and :C_methods.  At present,
       only the data members :version and :savedCfg are exposed; only
       the DEFERRED Class Persistent methods are exposed, since all of
       those implemented within Persistent are shallowly called by the
       child in its own method implementations. </DL>

   <P class="indent">
   Trying to declare the method :initClass() as DEFERRED runs into some
   problems in Xbase++ viz our introspection implementation.
   Therefore, :initClass() is simply not declared in Persistent.
   Nonetheless, :initClass() should effectively be considered a DEFERRED
   method, and a child is responsible for defining an :initClass().
   In most cases, this declaration can consist of exactly the following:

   <P class="code">
   INLINE CLASS METHOD initClass
   <br>&nbsp; ::exposeSelf()
   <br>&nbsp; ::exposeParent()
   <br>RETURN self

<H2>Life Cycle</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   Since Persistent is an abstact class, remarks about the specific
   implementation life cycle of a child class are subject to override.
   However, in a "normal" case, the life cycle of a child class will
   be as described.

   <P class="indent">
   An instance of a child class of Persistent normally comes into
   existence immediately upon its assignment with the ChildClass():new()
   method.  No seperate :create() method is required to request system
   resources.

   <P class="indent">
   A Persistent-child instance is destroyed when its variable falls out
   of its declaration scope.  In principle, the variable containing a
   Persistent instance can be declared LOCAL to a function, and the exit
   condition of the controlling function will preform all necessary
   destruction of the instance.

<H2>Instance Data</H2>

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:_data</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Array (member data list)]</em>
   <DD>Introspection data to expose member data.

   <DT><b>:_methods</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Array (member methods list)]</em>
   <DD>Introspection data to expose member methods.

   <DT><b>:savedCfg</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Boolean (.F.)]</em>
   <DD>Was this instance read from a diskfile?

   <DT><b>:version</b> <em>[EXPORTED; Numeric (Persistent():C_version)]</em>
   <DD>Version number of this instance (used for comparison with Class
       data :C_version in determining whether a serialized instance
       contains out-of-date Persistent fields.  Version number encodes
       the date of last change to the Class definition, i.e. 19990923.
   </DL>

<H2>Instance Methods</H2>

   <P class="indent">
   Instance methods of Persistent behave in a somewhat unusual manner
   because Persistent is an abstract class, and because of our standard
   for implementation of introspection.

   <P class="indent">
   The action performed by each Persistent instance method is performed
   not upon "self", as is done in instance methods of most classes, but
   upon a passed in special parameter "child".  The "child" parameter
   is always the "self" object of the child class instance.  Persistent
   methods come in pairs, one with an initial underscore, its match
   beginning with a letter, and declared as DEFERRED.  In the simplest
   case, a child class will implement one of these DEFERRED methods in
   the following manner:

   <P class="code">
   INLINE METHOD foo([...]) ; RETURN ::Persistent:_foo(self, [...])

   <P class="indent">
   The implementation of the method named with an initial underscore
   will resemble:

   <P class="code">
   METHOD Persistent:_foo(child, [...])
   <br>&nbsp; [...]
   <br>&nbsp; BarFunc(child)
   <br>&nbsp; [...]
   <br>RETURN child

   <P class="indent">
   Notice that if an instance object is returned, this object will
   normally be the object "child" rather than the object "self".

   <DL>
   <DT><b>:init()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_init(&lt;child&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Set introspection data members and default values for exposed
       data members (see child Class method :new() for a discussion of
       the special initializiation procedure of this class)

      <P>
      The :_init() method of the Persistent class, and thereby
      (normally) indirectly the :new() method of child classes,
      initializes introspection data in a somewhat unusual manner,
      compared to other classes.  Since Persistent-child instances are
      designed to be serialized and persistently stored, it is necessary
      to store introspection data in Class data members, as well as in
      the instance itself.  Doing this allows comparison of a serialized
      instance with current Class data.  Therefore, ::_data and
      ::_methods are initialized as Persistent():C_data and
      Persistent():C_methods, respectively.  Also ::version is
      initialized with its corresponding Class data,
      Persistent():C_version.


   <DT><b>:toDisk()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_toDisk(&lt;child&gt;, &lt;cFile&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Writes a serialized copy of the instance to a diskfile.
       Parameter &lt;cFile&gt; is required by :_toDisk(), but the
       child class may choose to implement a default value.

   <DT><b>:fromDisk()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_fromDisk(&lt;child&gt;, &lt;cFile&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Reads a serialized copy of a Persistent instance from diskfile.
       (if possible).  If no file is specified, or if the file specified
       does not exist, ::savedCfg is simply set to .F., and a reference
       to the original instance is returned.  Otherwise, the serialized
       data is read in, ::savedCfg is set to .T., and the read instance
       is returned.

       <P>
       Since XBase++ does not allow redefinition of self, the methods
       :fromDisk() and :verUpdate() return the modified Persistent-child
       instance, but do not update the existing instance in-place.

   <DT><b>:antiquated()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_antiquated(&lt;child&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Return a character string report of the differences (if any)
       between the calling instance's and the Class' introspection data
       and version number.

   <DT><b>:verUpdate()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_verUpdate(&lt;child&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Returns an updated copy of an instance.  Any data members of the
       current Class' instrospection data that are also present in the
       instance are copied into a new instance of the Persistent-child
       class. All other data members, and all methods, are defined
       according to the definition and initialization values of the most
       current version.

       <P>
       Since XBase++ does not allow redefinition of self, the methods
       :fromDisk() and :verUpdate() return the modified Persistent-child
       instance, but do not update the existing instance in-place.

   <DT><b>:uptoDate()</b> <em>[DEFERRED]</em><br>
       <b>:_uptoDate(&lt;child&gt;)</b>
   <DD>Returns a boolean value indicating whether the calling instance
       is current with the Class definition in the Library.
