<p><strong class="subhead">Abstract</strong></p>
 <p>  This article discusses how version-safe object persistence and
  introspection can be implemented in XBase++, and a few of the uses
  for which one might want to do this.
</p>

 <p>  The source code and library documentation contained at the end of this
  this article may also be downloaded from:

</blockquote><p>  A note on intellectual property is worthwhile here.  I don't believe
  in it.  Not at all; not even in the reluctant way that BSD-style
  licenses do.  If you want to use this source or the accompanying
  documentation in any project of your own--free, commercial, or even
  unfree but unpaid--I will be pleased to have made a contribution to
  the human community, and do not wish to impose any further obligation
  upon you.
</p>
<p>  Although I do not impose any obligation upon you for the ideas
  mentioned, there are a few things I consider polite conduct.  (1) If
  you think something I created helps you, I would certainly be
  interested in hearing about it; (2) I consider it good manners to make
  a certain acknowledgment of people who help you out, such as in
  documents accompanying products or code you distribute; (3) On the off
  chance that I create something that has significant re-use value for
  other programmers, I certainly would not object to receiving donations
  similar to what one might pay for commercial products of similar
  utility.  But all that is just my opinion on good manners; not any
  legal restriction on derived works.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Introduction</strong></p>
 <p>  Alaska's XBase++ compiler supports a superset of the Clipper language
  developed by Computer Associates.  Unlike CA-Clipper (a DOS product),
  XBase++ is targeted at Win32 and OS/2, including native GUI
  development on those platforms.  At the same time,
  backwards-compatible compilation options are provided for extremely
  easy recompilation of legacy Clipper/DOS code, with the option for
  incremental improvements to a GUI and event-driven environment.
</p>
<p>  One important addition to Clipper that XBase++ provides is the
  option of using object-oriented programming techniques.  XBase++
  both provides a very clean syntax for combining OOP and procedural
  code, and implements a very clear expression of OOP concepts.
  Almost every OOP technique one would want is present in XBase++:
  (multiple) inheritence, encapsulation, and polymorphism, of course;
  but also good scope and access control, and class methods and data.
  However, at least two niceties are absent from XBase++ OOP system:  a
  version-safe object persistence mechanism, and (relatedly) object
  introspection.  Fortunately, these two additional features can be
  added to XBase++ by creating some carefully designed ancestor classes,
  and obeying a few conventions in class data members.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">About Introspection</strong></p>
 <p>  Even many programmers familiar with object-oriented programming will
  be unfamiliar with introspection (the concept is also sometimes called
  "metadata").  Introspection is not among the canonical list of what
  defines OOP (inheritence, encapsulation, polymorphism), and is absent
  from many OOP languages (such as C++, Eiffel, and XBase++ by default).
  What "introspection" means is just the ability of a class or instance
  to tell other parts of a program what it <strong>has</strong> or what it <strong>does</strong> at
  runtime.  You can usually determine this from the source code, of
  course.  But in some contexts there is runtime dynamic class creation;
  and more often the source code is not available, but you still want to
  do something with an object.  "Unavailable" is a loose concept, by the
  way:  it might simply mean that someone else is working on a
  particular class, and you want to write code that does something with
  its instances without having to wait for the final version of the
  class to be written.
</p>
<p>  Some languages that have rich notions of introspection are Smalltalk,
  Python, and Java.  Java--probably the most widespread introspective
  language--introduced introspection in a way somewhat similar to that
  discussed in this article:  as part of the JavaBean standard.  That
  is, introspection is not really a language feature of Java, but rather
  a documented convention for writing classes that layer on
  introspection.  Smalltalk and Python, on the other hand--probably
  related to their extreme dynamism--are introspective at the heart of
  their language definitions.  Such differences in the "depth" of
  introspection has some implications for what we can do in XBase++.
  Specifically, we will be able to add introspection to classes we
  create ourselves, but we must remain blind to classes we do not
  control (such as the built in "XBase Parts").
</p>
<p>  The limitation of XBase++ (as of 1.2) in regard to "deep"
  introspection comes down to its provision of only "shallow" metadata
  functions.  Specifically, two of the functions XBase++ provides us
  with--IsMemberVar() and IsMethod()--really are introspective
  functions.  These functions answer a certain question about what an
  object <strong>has</strong> and <strong>does</strong>.  But the questions they answer is simply not
  as general as the questions that might be answered by the hypothetical
  functions ArrayMemberVars() and ArrayMethods()--which in my scenario
  would return arrays listing all the member variables and methods.  On
  the plus side for generality (and clarity even, I think), XBase++
  implements the Clipper macro syntax, even in OOP expressions.  This
  allows code like the following to work:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>instance        := MyClass():new()
instance:myData := "Gnosis Software"
varName         := "myData"
? instance:&amp;(varName)        // Result: Gnosis Software


</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p><strong class="subhead">About Object Persistence</strong></p>
 <p>  As with introspection, object persistence is non-canonical, and not
  all OOP languages have it.  What "object persistence" is is pretty
  simple, however.  It is the capability of saving a class instance from
  one execution context in order to use it in a different execution
  context.  The second context can be seperated in either time or space.
  In a distributed network, sometimes we want to create an object on one
  machine, then ship it across the network to be used by another
  machine.  Java's RMI is an example of this; CORBA is another; XML-RPC
  is another; DCOM is yet another; and JINI takes the idea about as far
  as it might go (as an extension of RMI).  But sometimes our desire for
  persistence is a bit more mundane than that motivated by the sea of
  acronyms in the last sentence.  Sometimes we just want to save what
  our program is doing in order to continue with it later.  In a sense,
  that is what a database is all about to start with; but a relational
  database may be a clumsy way to store an OOP object that is not
  relational in structure.  In these cases, it is easier to store the
  object itself (maybe in a database, maybe in the file-system, where it
  lives is not the main point).
</p>
<p>  You can have object persistence without having introspection.  But
  what is difficult to have is <strong>version-safe</strong> object persistence without
  having introspection.  That is, once a program restores an object that
  has been stored somewhere (or transmitted to it), it often makes sense
  to ask whether the object just restored is the same type of thing as
  another object that might be generated by the program (especially if
  the two have identical class names).  In this sense, introspection
  comes first, and (version-safe) object persistence is built on top of
  it.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Enough Computer Science, Why Bother?</strong></p>
 <p>  What got me worrying about all the somewhat theoretical OOP concerns
  outlined above was a very practical concern.  I was working as a
  consultant in converting an old CA-Clipper application to XBase++ 1.2
  (Win32).  But the issue could equally well come up in developing an
  application from scratch.
</p>
<p>  Two concerns were raised by my client; and the solutions turn out to
  be almost the same.  The old application had an error logging
  capability that replaced the default Clipper Error System.  Among
  other things, when a crash occurred in the old application, it would
  log some information about the application state to a log file.  This
  log file could be transmitted to technical support at the company
  supporting the application in order to identify the source of the
  problem.  This sort of system is familiar to many Clipper programmers
  (or programmers of other languages, for that matter).  However, one
  thing the old error logging system definitely <strong>could not</strong> do was to
  report meaningfully on what was happening with active instances of the
  new XBase++ classes.  The error system provided by Alaska does a
  little bit in this regard, but only a little.
</p>
<p>  The second issue was that we wanted to make various aspects of the
  system--especially the user interface--configurable.  There are many
  ways to store configuration information, of course; but we decided
  that a "Configuration" class would be a good way to do it.  The
  advantage of using OOP for configuration options is that it nests
  well.  A configurable feature may itself consist of multiple
  sub-features.  While it is certainly possible to store sub-features in
  an INI file or a DBF, the model of an object that "has" various
  attributes--including some attributes that are themselves objects--
  just seemed to fit what we wanted.  The fact that the development was
  in a process of design at the same time as being coded seemed to
  reinforce this idea.  If we just store a Configuration instance to
  disk, there would be no need to re-normalize our configuration
  database, or add new fields to a DBF or INI file, as we went along.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Solving The Problems</strong></p>
 <p>  Adding introspection to our own classes allows reporting object state
  information in an error log, or in other context where it is useful to
  know just what is in a class instance.  Or rather, adding
  introspection allows us to report at a higher level of generality than
  would be possible without it.  Any OOP system can manipulate or
  display the contents of instance data members if we know what specific
  members an instance has.  For example, in XBase++, we might have
  source lines like:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>instance := MyClass():new()
instance:myData := "Gnosis Software"
[...]
? instance:myData     // Result: Gnosis Software

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  This answers the specific question, "What value does the data member
  <code>myData</code> of the object <code>instance</code> hold?"  Introspection adds the
  capability of asking the meta-question "What are the data members of
  <code>instance</code>, and what values are stored in those members?"  For
  example, using the provided function STRINGIFY(), we can report on an
  arbitrary object without knowing about its data members in advance:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>? STRINGIFY(instance)  // Result:
                       //  (obj)MyClass
                       //    [Exposed member data]
                       //    myBoolean = .F.
                       //    version = 19990921
                       //    myData = Gnosis Software
                       //    myNum = 137
                       //
                       //    [Exposed member methods]
                       //    init

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  XBase++ itself provides us with the useful Var2Bin() function--and
  its partner Bin2Var()--which do most of the work of object
  persistence.  In fact, in the provided source code, the storage of an
  object instance only thinly wraps Var2Bin().  A whole method of the
  parent class Persistent is:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>METHOD Persistent:_toDisk(child, cFile)
   MEMOWRIT(cFile, Var2Bin(child))
RETURN child

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  If we just wanted object persistence, we would not need to look any
  farther than this.  But what we actually want is <strong>version-safe</strong> object
  persistence.  Specific to the Configuration that motivated this, we
  wish to be able to take several steps:
</p>
<blockquote>    
    1. Read a stored Configuration instance;<br/>
    2. Check whether the instance matches current application version;<br/>
    3. If the instance is from an old version, fill in any unavailable
       configuration options with current default values.
</blockquote><p>  What we get out of taking these steps is the ability to add new
  Configuration options as we go along, but still maintain the
  compatibility with stored configurations from previous application
  versions.  The example (and actual use) of a configuration file is
  particularly clear, but in general the same mechanism would work for
  storage and retrieval of any versioned OOP data.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Introspection Conventions</strong></p>
 <p>  The full details can be found in the included source code and library
  documentation.  But it is worth summarizing our conventions in this
  main text.  Introspection is implemented using a specific convention
  in <strong>every</strong> class created in a project.  This requires some extra
  attention in writing the class code, but is pretty mechanical to
  perform.
</p>
<p>  Every class defines data members with the names "_data" and
  "_methods".  Each of these simply contains an array of strings listing
  the respective types of class members.  I have used the convention of
  an initial underscore in the name of every data member and method that
  is <strong>not</strong> to be exposed (including the data members "_data" and
  "_methods").  This convention allows us to shield some class members
  from introspection; we might do this either because we think that some
  members are entirely accidental to implementation, and should not be
  exposed, or because some members relate to the internal mechanism of
  introspection and persistence (and should not, as such, be exposed).
  Ultimately, the programmer has freedom to expose whatever she wishes
  to, and hide everything else.
</p>
<p>  An example of a class which exposes introspection, but is not directly
  persistent is ColorScheme.  The :init() method of an instrospective
  class has the special responsibility to initialize the data members
  "_data" and "_members".  For example:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>METHOD ColorScheme:init()
   // Introspection data
   ::_data    := { "Activeborder", "Passiveborder",             ;
                   "Hilite", "Shadow", "Titlebar", "Titletext", ;
                   "Statusbar", "DialogBG",                     ;
                   "SchemeName" }
   ::_methods := { "init", "Old", "Windows" }

   ::Old()
RETURN self

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  Actually creating these lines in the :init() method is basically as
  simple as copying a few lines from the class' declaration.  See the
  source code for ColorScheme.prg as an illustration.
</p>
<p>  For a good example of what to do with a class instance, look at the
  STRINGIFY() function used above (its source code and documentation are
  in this package also).  In your own project, you will probably want to
  make additional uses of introspection; but the model in STRINGIFY() is
  easy to follow and adapt.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Persistence Conventions</strong></p>
 <p>  As was mentioned, nothing much is needed for object persistence per
  se.  But some conventions are very useful to deal with instance
  versioning.  The way this is handled in the provided library code is
  to create an Abstract Parent Class Persistent.  XBase++ does not
  implement the keyword <code>ABSTRACT</code>, as some languages do.  But it does
  the equivalent thing with the keyword <code>DEFERRED</code> which applies to
  methods.  If one or more methods are deferred, the class is an
  abstract class.
</p>
<p>  Every class that wishes to be persistent should inherit from Class
  Persistent.  In our library samples, the only class that does so is
  Configuration (however, a ColorScheme instance is a data member of a
  Configuration instance, so it gains persistence vicariously).
  The Persistent parent class provides a unified approach to versioning
  issues; it also implements the actual storage/retrieval methods.  In
  the provided code, storage is just MEMOREAD()/MEMOWRIT() calls; but by
  having a parent class, we could globally reimplement a different
  storage technique without having to make any changes to child classes.
</p>
<p>  Classes that inherit from Persistent have several obligations in
  implementing DEFERRED methods.  Fortunately, as with introspection,
  the conventions are pretty mechanical.  The clearest thing is to
  examine Configuration.prg to see how all the conventions are followed
  (the source file is well documented).  One special line needs to be
  included in the child's :init() method and several special
  requirements apply to the child's declaration.  The :init() method
  should include the following line:
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>::Persistent:_init(self)

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  In the child class declaration, an initClass() method should be used,
  and should contain the lines in the below example (if other actions
  specific to the child class are required, they may be added, of
  course).  The DEFERRED method exposeSelf() should also be implemented,
  and should contain exactly the lines listed in the example (adjusting
  for the current date in the version, and for the actual data members
  and methods of the child class).  Several (non-exposed) methods are
  implemented in Persistent, and are named with a leading underscore.
  The corresponding methods without the underscore are DEFERRED in
  Persistent, and the child must implement them.  In most cases, the
  implementation of each exposed method will be no more than a call to
  the corresponding underscored method.  All in all, the following is a
  sufficient class declaration for a child of Persistent.  Obviously, if
  you want the class to do more, add the capabilities it needs.
</p>
<p><strong></strong>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="code-sample" width="100%"><tr><td>
<pre>CLASS MyClass FROM Persistent
  PROTECTED:
    INLINE CLASS METHOD initClass
      ::exposeSelf()
      ::exposeParent()
    RETURN self

    INLINE CLASS METHOD exposeSelf
      ::C_version := 20000501
      ::C_data    := {"myBoolean", "myData", "myNum"}
      ::C_methods := { }
      RETURN self

  EXPORTED:
    VAR myBoolean, myData, myNum
    METHOD init
    INLINE METHOD fromDisk(c)  ; RETURN ::Persistent:_fromDisk(self, c)
    INLINE METHOD antiquated() ; RETURN ::Persistent:_antiquated(self)
    INLINE METHOD uptoDate()   ; RETURN ::Persistent:_uptoDate(self)
    INLINE METHOD toDisk(c)    ; RETURN ::Persistent:_toDisk(self,"fname")
    INLINE METHOD verUpdate    ; RETURN ::Persistent:_verUpdate(self)

ENDCLASS

</pre>
</td></tr></table></p>
<p>  These few conventions are simple to follow, and wind up providing
  version-safe object persistence for any child class that follows them.
</p>
<p><strong class="subhead">Working With A Persistent Child</strong></p>
 <p>  I developed the below test script (included with a few extra comments
  as tstcfg.prg) to validate persistence and versioning of a
  Configuration instance.  This is a quick workout of the basic
  Persistent methods.
