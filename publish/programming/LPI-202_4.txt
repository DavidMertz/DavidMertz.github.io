About this series

  The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) certifies Linux system
  administrators at junior and intermediate levels. There are two exams
  at each certification level. This series of seven tutorials helps you
  prepare for the second of the two LPI intermediate level system
  administrator exams--LPI exam 202. A companion series of tutorials is
  available for the other intermediate level exam--LPI exam 201. Both
  exam 201 and exam 202 are required for intermediate level
  certification. Intermediate level certification is also known as
  certification level 2.

  Each exam covers several or topics and each topic has a weight. The
  weight indicate the relative importance of each topic. Very roughly,
  expect more questions on the exam for topics with higher weight. The
  topics and their weights for LPI exam 202 are:

  * Topic 205: Network Configuration (8)
  * Topic 206: Mail and News (9)
  * Topic 207: Domain Name System (DNS) (8)
  * Topic 208: Web Services (6)
  * Topic 210: Network Client Management (6)
  * Topic 212: System Security (10)
  * Topic 214: Network Troubleshooting (1)

About this tutorial

  Welcome to "Web Services", the fourth of seven tutorials covering
  intermediate network administration on Linux. In this tutorial, we
  discuss how to configure and run the Apache HTTPd server, and some
  ancillary servers like the Squid Web Proxy Cache.  It is worth noting
  some of what is -not- covered in this tutorial: designing and
  modifying HTML pages; writing CGI scripts; analyzing security issues
  (beyond some very basics); accessing backend databases; and generally
  everything about "web programming".  For this tutorial, we just want
  you to learn how to get a web server running, not how to provide
  useful content on that web server.

Prerequisites

  To get the most from this tutorial, you should already have a basic
  knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can
  practice the commands covered in this tutorial.

About Apache

  Apache is the predominant web server on the internet as a whole, and
  is even more predominant when only Linux servers are under discussion.
  A few more special purpose--and occassionally higher performance for
  specific tasks--web servers are available, but Apache is nonetheless
  always your default choice.  Apache comes pre-installed by most Linux
  distributions, and in fact is often already running after being
  launched during initialization, even if you have not specifically
  configured a web server.  If Apache is not installed, use the normal
  installation system of your distribution to install it; or download
  the latest source from <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>.  Many
  extra capabilities are provided by modules, many distributed with
  Apache itself, others available from third parties.

  The latest Apache has been at the 2.x level since 2001, however,
  Apache 1.3.x is still in widespread usage, and the 1.3.x series
  continues to be maintained for bugfixes and security updates. Some
  minor configuration difference exist between 1.3 and 2.x version, and
  a few modules are available for 1.3 that are not available for 2.x.
  The latest releases as of this writing are 1.3.34 (stable), 2.0.55
  (stable) and 2.1.9 (beta).

  As a rule, a new server should use the latest stable version in the
  2.x series. Unless you have a specific need for an unusual older
  module, 2.x provides good stability, more capabilities, and overall
  mostly better peformance (in some tasks, such as in PHP support, 1.3
  still peforms better).  Moving forward, new features will certainly be
  better supported in 2.x than in 1.3.x.

About Sqid

  Squid is a proxy caching server for web clients, supporting the
  protocols HTTP, FTP, TLS, SSL, and HTTPS. By running a cache on a
  local network, or at least closer to your network than the resources
  queries, speed can be improved and network bandwidth reduced.  When
  the same resource is requested multiple times by machines served by
  the same Squid server, the resources is delivered from a server-local
  copy rather than requiring the request go out over multiple network
  routers, and to potentially slow or overloaded destination servers.

  It is possible to configure Squid either as an explicit proxy that
  must be configured in each web client (browser), or to intercept all
  web requests out of a LAN and cache all such traffic. Squid may be
  configured with various options about how long, and under what
  conditions, to keep pages cached.

Other resources

  As with most Linux tools, it is always useful to examine the manpages
  for any utilities discussed. Versions and switches might change
  between utility or kernel version, or with different Linux
  distributions. For more in depth information, the Linux Documentation
  Project has a variety of useful documents, especially its HOWTOs. See
  http://www.tldp.org/.  A variety of books on Linux networking have
  been published; I have found O'Reilly's _TCP/IP Network
  Administration_, by Craig Hunt to be quite helpful (find whatever
  edition is most current when you read this).

  A large number of good books have been written on working with Apache.
  Some are concerned with general administration, while others cover
  particular modules or special configurations of Apache.  Check your
  local bookseller for a range of available titles.  Out of the dozens
  of titles available, none stand out to this writer for special
  mention, though many of them are quite excellent.

RUNNING APACHE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A swarm of daemons

  Launching Apache is similar to launching any other daemon. Usually you
  wish to put its launch in your system initialization scripts, but in
  principle you may launch Apache at any time. On most systems, the
  Apache server is called 'httpd', though it may be called 'apache2'
  instead. The server is probably installed in '/usr/sbin/', but other
  locations are possible, depending on distribution and how you
  installed the server.

  Most of the time you will launch Apache with no options, but the '-d
  serverroot' and '-f config' options are worth keeping in mind. The
  first lets you specify a location on the local disks where content
  will be served from; the second lets you specify a non-default
  configuration file. A configuration file may override the '-f' option
  using the 'ServerRoot' directive (most do).  By default, configuration
  files are either 'apache2.conf' or 'httpd.conf', depending on
  compilation options; these files might live at '/etc/apache2/',
  '/etc/apache/', '/etc/httpd/conf/', '/etc/httpd/apache/conf' or a few
 other locations, depending on version, Linux distribution, and how you
 installed of compiled Apache.  Checking 'man apache2' or 'man httpd'
 should give you system-specific details.

 The Apache daemon is unusual when compared with other servers in that
 it usually creates several running copies of itself. The primary copy
 simply spawns the others, while these secondary copies service the
 actual incoming requests.  The goal in having multiple running copies
 is to act as a "pool" for requests that may arrive in bundles;
 additional copies of the daemon are launched as needed, according to
 several configuration parameters.  The primary copy usually runs as
 'root', but the other copies as a more restricted user for security
 reasons.  E.g.:

     # ps axu | grep apache2
     root      6620     Ss   Nov12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start -DSSL
     www-data  6621     S    Nov12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start -DSSL
     www-data  6622     Sl   Nov12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start -DSSL
     www-data  6624     Sl   Nov12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start -DSSL
     dqm        313     S+   03:44   0:00 man apache2
     root       637     S+   03:59   0:00 grep apache2

  On many systems, the restricted user will be 'nobody'.  In the example
  above it is 'www-data'.

Including configuration files

  As mentioned in the last panel, the behavior of Apache is affected by
  directives in its configuration file. For Apache2 systems, the main
  configuration file is likely to reside at '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf';
  but often this file will contain multiple "Include" statements to add
  configuration information from other files, possibly by wildcard
  pattern. Overall, an Apache configuration is likely to contain
  hundreds of directives and options (most not specifically documented
  in this tutorial).

  I few files are particularly like to be included. You might see
  'httpd.conf' for "user" settings, and to utilize prior Apache 1.3
  configuration files that use that name.  Virtual hosts are typically
  specified in separate configuration files, matched on a wildcard,
  e.g.:

      # Include the virtual host configurations:
      Include /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/[^.#]*

  With Apache 2.x, modules are typically specified in separate
  configuration files as well (more often in the same file in 1.3.x).
  For example, a system of mine includes:

      #------------- From '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf' -----------------#
      # Include module configuration:
      Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load
      Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.conf

  Actually using a module in a running Apache requires two steps in the
  configuration file, both loading it and enabling it, e.g.:

      #--------------- Loading an option Apache module ----------------#
      # cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.load
      LoadModule userdir_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_userdir.so
      # cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf
      <IfModule mod_userdir.c>
          UserDir public_html
          UserDir disabled root

          <Directory /home/*/public_html>
              AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
              Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
          </Directory>
      </IfModule>

  The wildcards in the 'Include' lines will insert all the '.load' and
  '.conf' files in the '/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/' directory.

  One thing to notice here is a general pattern: basic directives are
  one line commands with some options; more complex directives nest
  commands using an XML-like open/close tag. You just have to know for
  each directive whether it is one-line or open/close style, you cannot
  choose among styles at will.

Log files

  An important class of configuration directives concern logging of
  Apache operations.  A lot of different types of information, and
  degree of detail, can be maintained for Apache operations.  An error
  log is always a good thing to keep, and you can specify it with the
  single directive:

      # Global error log.
      ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log

  Other logs of server access, referrers, of other information, can be
  customized to fit your individual setup.  A logging operation is
  configured with two directives.  First a 'LogFormat' directive uses a
  set of special variables to specify what goes in the log file; second a
  'CustomLog' directive tells Apache to actually record events in the
  specified format.  An unlimited number of formats may be specified,
  whether or not each one is actually used.  This allows you to switch
  on and off logging details based on evolving needs.

  Variables in a 'LogFormat' are similar to shell variables, but with a
  leading '%'.  Some variables have single-letter while others have long
  names surrounded by brackets.  For example:

      LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
      CustomLog /var/log/apache2/referer_log combined

  Consult a book or full Apache documentation for the list of variables.
  Commonly used ones include '%h' for IP address of requesting client,
  '%t' for datetime of the request, '%>s' for HTTP status code, and the
  mispelled '%{Referer}' for the referring site that led to the served
  page.

  The name used in the 'LogFormat' and 'CustomLog' directives is
  arbitrary.  In the example, the name 'combined' was used, but it could
  just as well be 'myfoobarlog'.  However, a few names are commonly
  used and come with sample configuration files, such as 'combined',
  'common', 'referer', 'agent'.  These specific formats are typically
  supported directly by log-analyzer tools.

Virtual hosts, multi-homing, and per-directory options

  Individual directories served by an Apache server may have their own
  configuration options. However, the main configuration may limit which
  options can be configured locally. If per-directory configuration is
  desired, use the 'AccessFileName' directive, and typically specify
  the local configuration filename of '.htaccess'.  The limitations of
  local configuration are specified within a '<Directory>' directive.
  For example:

      #----------------- Example of Directory directive ---------------#
      #Let's have some Icons, shall we?
      Alias /icons/ "/usr/share/apache2/icons/"
      <Directory "/usr/share/apache2/icons">
            Options Indexes MultiViews
            AllowOverride None
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
      </Directory>

  Often working in conjunction with per-directory options, Apache can
  service "virtual hosts".  What this means is that multiple domain
  names may be served from the same Apache process, each accessing an
  appropriate directory.  Defining virtual hosts is done with the
  '<VirtualHost>' directive.  This may be done by placing configuration
  files in an included directory, such as '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/',
  or it may be contained directly in a main configuration file.  In use,
  you might specify, e.g.:

      #------------------ Configuring virtual hosts -------------------#
      <VirtualHost "foo.example.com">
          ServerAdmin webmaster@foo.example.com
          DocumentRoot /var/www/foo
          ServerName foo.example.com
          <Directory /var/www/foo>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
          </Directory>
          ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
          <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
                AllowOverride None
                Options ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
          </Directory>
          CustomLog /var/log/apache2/foo_access.log combined
      </VirtualHost>
      <VirtualHost "bar.example.org">
          DocumentRoot /var/www/bar
          ServerName bar.example.org
      </VirtualHost>
      <VirtualHost *>
          DocumentRoot /var/www
      </VirtualHost>

  The final '*' option picks up any HTTP requests that are not directed
  to one of the explicitly specified names (e.g. addressed by IP
  address, or as an unspecified symbolic domain which also resolves to
  the server machine).  For virtual domains to work, DNS must define
  each alias with a CNAME record.

  Multi-homed servers sound similar to virtual hosting, but the concept
  is different. Using multi-homing, you may configure which IP addresses
  that a machine is connected to allow web requests. For example, you
  might provide HTTP access only to the local LAN, but not to the
  outside world. If you specify an address to listen on, you may also
  indicate a non-default port. The default value for 'BindAddress' is
  '*', which means to accept requests on every IP address under which
  the server may be reched. A mixed example might look like:

      #------------------- Configuring multi-homing -------------------#
      BindAddress 192.168.2.2
      Listen 192.168.2.2:8000
      Listen 64.41.64.172:8080

  In this case, we will accept all client requests from the local LAN
  (i.e. that use the 192.168.2.2 address) on the default port 80, and on
  the special port 8000. This Apache installation will also monitor
  client HTTP requests from the WAN address, but only on port 8080.

Limiting web access

  You may enable per-directory server access with the 'Order', 'Allow
  from' and 'Deny from' commands, within a '<Directory>' directive.
  Denied or allowed addresses may be specified by full or partial
  hostnames or IP addresses. 'Order' lets you give precedence between
  the accept list and the deny list.

  In many cases, you would like more fine-tuned control than simply
  allowing particular hosts to access your web server.  To enable user
  login requirements, you may use the 'Auth*' family of commands, again
  within the '<Directory>' directive.  For example, to setup Basic
  Authentication, you might use a directive like:

      #--------------- Configuring Basic Authentication ---------------#
      <Directory "/var/www/baz">
          AuthName "Baz"
          AuthType Basic
          AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/http.passwords
          AuthGroupFile /etc/apache2/http.groups
          Require john jill sally bob
      </Directory>

  You may also specify Basic Authentication within a per-directory
  '.htaccess' file. Digest Authentication is more secure than Basic, but
  is less widely implemented in browsers. However, the weakness of Basic
  (that it transmits passwords in clear-text) is better solved with an
  SSL layer anyway.

  Support for SSL encryption of web traffic is provided by the module
  'mod_ssl'. When SSL is used, data transmitted between server and
  client is encrypted with a dynamically negotiated password that is
  resistent to interception. All major browsers support SSL. For more
  information on configuring Apache 2.x with 'mod_ssl' see
  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html>.

RUNNING SQUID
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing and running Squid

  In most distributions, you should be able to install Squid using the
  normal installation procedures.  You may obtain the source verion of
  Squid from <http://www.squid-cache.org/>.  Building from source uses
  the basic './configure; make; make install' sequence.

  Once installed, you may simply run, as 'root', '/usr/sbin/squid' (or
  whatever location your distribution uses, perhaps '/usr/local/sbin/').
  Of course, to do much useful, you will want to configure the Squid
  configuration file at '/etc/squid/squid.conf',
  '/usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf', or wherever precisely your system
  locates 'squid.conf'. As with almost all daemons, you may use a
  different configuration file, in this case with the '-f' option.

Ports, IP addresses, http_access and ACLs

  The most important configuration option for Squid is the 'http_port'
  options you select.  You may monitor whichever ports you wish,
  optionally attaching each one to a particular IP address or hostname.
  The default port for Squid is 3128, allowing any IP address that
  connects to the Squid server.  To cache only for a LAN, you want to
  specify the local IP address instead, e.g.:

      # default (disabled)
      # http_port 3128
      # LAN only
      http_port 192.168.2.2:3128

  You may also enable caching via other Squid servers using the
  'icp_port' and 'htcp_port'.  The IPC and HTCP protocols are used for
  caches to communicate between themselves, rather than by web servers
  and clients themselves. To cache multicasts, use 'mcast_groups'.

  To let clients connect to your Squid server, you need to give them
  permission to do so.  Unlike a Web server, Squid is typically not
  entirely generous with its resources.  In the simple case, we can just
  use a couple 'subnet/netmask' or CIDR (Classless Internet Domain
  Routing) patterns to control permissions, e.g.:

      #---------------- Simple Squid access permissions ---------------#
      http_access deny 10.0.1.0/255.255.255.0
      http_access allow 10.0.0.0/8
      icp_access allow 10.0.0.0/8

  The 'acl' directive can be used to name access control lists (ACLs).
  You can name 'src' ACLs that simply specify address ranges as in the
  above example; but you can also create other types of ACLs.  For
  example:

      #----------------- Fine tuned access permissions ----------------#
      acl mynetwork     src             192.168/16
      acl asp           urlpath_regex   \.asp$
      acl bad_ports     port            70 873
      acl javascript    rep_mime_type -i ^application/x-javascript$
      # what HTTP access to allow classes
      http_access deny asp          # don't cache active server pages
      http_access deny bad_ports    # don't cache gopher or rsync
      http_access deny javascript   # don't cache javascript content
      http_access allow mynetwork   # allow LAN everything not denied

  This example gives only a small subset of the available ACL types. See
  a sample 'squid.conf' for example of many others. Or take a look at
  the documentation at <http://squid-docs.sourceforge.net/latest/html/c1389.html>.
  In this case, we decide not to cache URLs that end with '.asp'
  (probably dynamic content), not to cache ports 70 and 873, and not to
  cache returned javascript objects. Other than what is denied, machines
  on the LAN (the /16 range given) will have all their requests cached.
  Notice that each ACL defined has a unique, but arbitrary, name (use
  names that make sense, but the names are not reserved).

Caching modes

  The simplest way to run Sqid is in proxy mode.  If you do this,
  clients will need to be explicitly configured to use the cache.  Web
  browser clients have configuration screens that allow them to specify
  a proxy address and port rather than a direct HTTP connection.  This
  setup makes configuring Squid very simple, but makes clients do some
  setup work if they want to benefit from the Squid cache.

  You may also configure Squid to run as a transparent cache. To do this
  you need to either configure policy based routing (outside of Squid
  itself, using 'ipchains' or 'ipfilter') or use your Squid server as a
  gateway. Assuming you can direct external requests via the Squid
  server, Squid needs to be configured as follows. You may need to
  recompile Squid with the '--enable-ipf-transparent' option; however,
  in most Linux installations this should already be fine. To configure
  the server for transparent caching (once it gets the redirected
  packets), add something like the below to your 'squid.conf':

      httpd_accel_host virtual
      httpd_accel_port 80
      httpd_accel_with_proxy on
      httpd_accel_uses_host_header on
