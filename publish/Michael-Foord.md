I was honored to have known and loved Michael, at both some of his best and
worst times.  I knew him in Python context, but also personally, before and
after the following anecdote.  

I spoke with him regularly over video, over the last year or two, and he and I
co-organized (advised technically) PyCon MEA in Dubai, in 2021 and 2022.  In 
that first year, I spent much of the trip with him individually, including a 
lovely dinner at the foot of Burj Khalifa.

In that conversation, as always, he was strident and opinionated, but had the
deepest respect for his friends, even in the moments of our disagreement.  His
genuineness and compassion ran deep.

In this conversation, he had a sort of Burkean commitment to that saying about
clear ideas being expressible in a sentence or two. Hence he was dismissive of
the abstract political philosophy in which I did my dissertation work.

It's a conversation I remember well with enormous fondness and a few eyerolls.
He was so earnest and impassioned... and often enough right.

As my pedagogical effort, I challenged Michael to explain, e.g. Python
metaclasses in a sentence. His admirable offering was "The class of an object
is object."

This is indeed true, and once you unpack it, it indeed explains metaclasses. I
think the unpacking takes rather more sentences. And also that my
condensation of Historical Marxism as "History is the history of class
struggle" had the same quality.

Rest in Power my good friend.
