FROM:
David Mertz, Ph.D., Emeritus Fellow of the PSF

The PSF (hereafter "Foundation") Executive Director, Deb Nicholson, has
behaved in a manner that is unprofessional, motivated by personal animosity,
in violation of Foundation bylaws, and that violated her fiduciary obligations
as an employee and officer of the Foundation.

As preface I will note that I believe that "sunshine is the best disinfectant."
Therefore, I generally anticipate publication of this letter in public fora.  I
will not, of course, publish any replies—should I receive them—without express
permission of their senders.

As recipients of this note will be aware, I have had numerous volunteer roles
within the Foundation, dating back to 2008.  I had, in fact, been the longest
continuously serving volunteer with the Foundation prior to the actions
of Ms. Nicholson, discussed below.

During the Foundation election of 2024, concluding on 2024-07-17, I opposed
the bylaws change entitled "Allow for removal of Fellows by a Board vote in
response to Code of Conduct violations, removing the need for a vote of the
membership."  I expressed my reasons for opposition, wholly professionally, on
a PSF owned mailing list, and on its Discourse discussion board.

During the course of this discussion, shortly before election results were
announced, I wrote a letter requesting conversion to Emeritus status on
2024-07-15. In that note, I expressed discontent with both the motivations for
this bylaws amendment and with the manipulation of the discussion by moderators
on the Discourse site (including actively changing the words of posts opposing
the motion so as to alter their meaning).

At that point, my only remaining volunteer role with the Foundation was that
of co-chair of the Trademarks Work Group, which role I had performed
continuously for over 15 years.  I was (or am) nominally co-chair of the
Scientific Python Work Group, but that committee has been quiescent, and may
or may not have been dissolved by the Board (no motion supports this, but one
Director stated to me personally that they believed it to be so).

Shortly after conclusion of the PSF election of 2024, Ms. Nicholson wrote me
with the below text, after first removing my email from the mailing list
associated with the Trademarks WG, and probably changing the access credentials
to administer that list.  She in no way communicated to me any concerns she
might have have prior to taking these incautious actions.

    Subject: Your role on the PSF Trademark Working Group
    To: mertz@gnosis.cx, David Mertz <david.mertz@gmail.com>

    Hello David,

    Myself and many other community members have read your recent
    writing that you distrust the PSF and that you believe that the
    organization needs replacing. I don't think that this attitude is
    compatible with the responsibility of serving on a PSF
    Board-delegated working group that responds to community members
    about sensitive matters on behalf of the Foundation and acting as
    a representative of the Foundation.

    I want to thank you for your many, many years of service on the
    Trademark Working Group, but sadly, at this point I need to ask
    for your resignation.  If you would like to discuss this with me,
    I am available for that, https://calendly.com/deb-psf/30min

    Sincerely,

    Deb Nicholson

To be clear on the matter, at no point in any communication had I, nor have I
since, stated in any forum (nor in any private communication), that I would
fail to follow my own fiduciary duties in enforcing the Foundation trademarks,
as I had done diligently for more than 15 years.  My intention to do so had not
changed; if I had felt it would, I would have resigned my position on that Work
Group; in actuality, I continue to intellectionally and morally support the
enforcement of Foundation trademarks.

I absolutely *did not*, in fact, resign, but was summarily removed by Ms.
Nicholson.  Because this action was taken without a Board vote, her action
explicitly violates the Foundation's bylaws.  I fully recognize that it is
within the power of the Board to remove any Work Group member, at any time, for
any reason or with no reason. However, even a retroactive vote to perform this
action would not create a legal or ethical justification for Ms.  Nicholson's
2024-07-19 violating action.

The violation is not simply a circumvention of the Foundation's bylaws, but
is, in fact, an ethical and legal lapse of her duties as an officer of a
United States nonprofit corporation.  Specifically, while I am not an
attorney, I *am* a subject matter expert in trademark law, in the United
States and, to a lesser extent, internationally.  The work I had volunteered
over the last 15 years has saved the Foundation tens or hundreds of thousands
of dollars that it would have otherwise had to spend in legal fees.  Ms.
Nicholson's action *will* similarly needlessly cost the Foundation tens or
hundred of thousands of dollars for counsel to perform these duties, which I
have been excluded from entirely out of spite.

I do not have current plans to take legal action against Ms. Nicholson or the
Foundation, but I *was* a member in good standing of the Foundation at the time
she took the referenced action, and her fiduciary violation directly affected
me as such a member (as well as negatively impacting all other members).
Officers of nonprofits have been penalized under law for lesser unethical
behavior.

---

It is my belief that the following would be a correct remediation of this
professional and ethical lapse by Ms. Nicholson.  Should it be taken, I will
be satisfied to let the matter lie. I probably (but not absolutely), do not
wish to resume my role as co-chair of the Trademarks Work Group, at this
point.

  - Ms. Nicholson posts a public and unambigous apology for her described
    action, and acknowledges that I, at no point, indicated or suggested
    that I would be remiss in the fiduciary duty which I undertook.
  - This publication occurs in a permanent and world-readable forum, ideally
    on the PSF Blog.

Yours, David Mertz
