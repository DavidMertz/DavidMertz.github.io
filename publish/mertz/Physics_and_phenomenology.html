<H2 CLASS="western">Physics and phenomenology</H2>
<P>by <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/LuluLotus">David Mertz</A> on

<P>I listened recently to a radio show that featured as a guest the
wonderful blogosphere science writer PZ Myers, and&nbsp; another
guest who followed the somewhat silly Agape stuff--i.e. a new-agey
church/tendency that basically recirculates an old &quot;spiritualism&quot;
in believing in a generic &quot;something else&quot; with which
consciousness is &quot;attuned.&quot;&nbsp; Basically just Freud's
&quot;oceanic feeling&quot; and doesn't have much of the doctrinal
politics of most organized religion. It's a relatively harmless trend
politically, and generally promotes values of human equality,
non-discrimination, and whatnot, notwithstanding its ontological
foolishness.</P>
<P>Myers' response to the new-age guest made me feel like he really
missed the boat in his answer. Of course, he's a mere biologist, not
a philosopher like me.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Myers pointed out that &quot;consciousness&quot; is epiphenomenal
to the physical embodiment of our neural wiring.&nbsp; And of course,
once those neurons shut down, so does the thought or perception that
emerges from their activity.&nbsp; That's obviously true as a matter
of actual physics, but it's not actually that principled of a point.&nbsp;
There <EM>is</EM> well understood structural causation as an
explanatory mechanism.&nbsp; So even though it isn't <EM>actually</EM>
true, it is not impossible to spin a materialistic story about
consciousness as <EM>structure</EM> causing itself to be replicated
substantially in a medium other than those particular neurons.&nbsp;
At a simple level, of course, a crystal structure can cause its own
replication outside the mass where it initially exists, for
example... so there's a simple (physical) model for &quot;continuation
of the soul.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;Of course it doesn't <EM>actually</EM> happen, but an
explanation along those lines isn't fundamentally antithetical to a
possible materialist story.&nbsp; For that matter, it even seems
moderately plausible that at some point in the future, technology
might be able to take a snapshot of the state of all those neural
connections in someone's head, and copy them over to something else,
like a computer chip that is made to be topologically equivalent (at
least by emulation) of the neural state of a person (maybe start with
the neural state of an fruit fly, but the same principle would
apply).&nbsp; Maybe we will be (or already are) brains in vats, and
so on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;However, what strikes me as far more fundamentally wrong
with these religious or &quot;spiritual&quot; notions of a &quot;soul&quot;
or &quot;enduring consciousness&quot; is that they miss the
fundamental phenomenological structure of consciousness.
Consciousness is a feature of proprioception, and hence &quot;life
after death&quot; fails not simply as a matter of physics, but as a
matter of phenomonology.&nbsp; I cannot conceive of my &quot;self&quot;
apart from the physical state of my body in which my perception of a
self exists; I am not &quot;pure consciousness&quot; but rather a
thing that knows itself as something sitting in a chair, with limbs
in certain positions, a certain set of visual objects arranged before
me, my stomach rumbling just slightly with hunger, etc (or whatever
the exact state I am in as I form the immediate concept of self or
ego).&nbsp; Consciousness is always--and by its very
quality--<EM>embodied</EM>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;So even if gods or future scientist pulled out some <EM>thing</EM>
which was structurally or physically present in me as a living thing,
and put it somewhere else, it would no longer be <EM>me</EM> in any
interesting way.&nbsp; An <EM>I</EM>&nbsp; can't exist in a floaty
realm of angels and spirits and white light... or at any rate, not an
<EM>I</EM>&nbsp; that has anything interesting in common with the
self that I (David) have.&nbsp; I'd feel the same way about &quot;soul
donation&quot; after I die as I do about any other organ donation
(which reminds me that I should get around to filling out the
donation form for UCLA medical school, on the off chance my organs
could be of some research use).</P>
