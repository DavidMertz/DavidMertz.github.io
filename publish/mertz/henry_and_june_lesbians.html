<p>An interesting question, perhaps, is contained in the title; but then
one may also ask, more precisely, "How many?" We will quickly multiply
the number of possible answers by at least a few hundred. For a start,
there are four -- or better, five -- candidates for being lesbian in the
film. We will detail these, and their respective claims below. Next, there
are at least several ways of saying what a lesbian is. Under some or most
of these definitions, lesbians are said to be "women;" and again, under
some or most of these definitions, their "lover(s)" are said to be "women."
However, what a "woman" is is a rather tricky question, as readers are
certainly aware. One can think of at least half of a dozen answers to this
question which are each plausible and plausibly distinct from each other;
but then, one can also think of many theories which give different answers
on what it is to be a "woman" loving versus a "woman" loved -- most of
which don't even need mention that old Platonic canard. Cross-cutting all
this, the word `lover' which we have mentioned certainly lends itself to
more that one definition.
<p>Let us do a quick bit of mathematics. Who are the lesbians in the film?
It seems that, depending on what theory one likes, the answer for each
candidate is independent of the answer for the others. That is, we have,
for the five candidates, 2<sup>5</sup> possible combinations of lesbians.
Next, even ignoring differences in possible definitions of `lesbian', We
have claimed at least six possible definitions of `woman' -- but that needs
to be squared to include the possible difference in the definitions of
"woman as subject" and of "woman as object." Finally, let us say, conservatively,
that `lover' may mean at least three possible things. All this puts a bottom
limit of three thousand four hundred fifty-six on the number of possible
papers which might follow.
<p>The reader has rolled her eyes by now; and has, perhaps, let out a sigh
of irritation. This little parlor trick with numbers surely, to her mind,
shows nothing about the serious questions which exist about the relations
between (artistic/cultural) representation, sexuality, gender, and such
like matters. Even the post-moderns, who praise multiplicity so much, are
no more than bored by something so banal as multiplication. But perhaps
there is a hint of a purpose in this parlor trick. After all, is it not
usually addition by which societal formations are combined rather than
by multiplication? Do we not, for example, usually speak, on the left,
of adding together such things as patriarchy, capitalism, homophobia, etc.
in order to arrive, theoretically, at that grand amalgam of oppression
we call the USA? Perhaps the sleight-of-hand in those first couple paragraphs
hinted at a new sort of combinatorics to be found in the pages to follow.
<h2>
<b>The Candidates.</b></h2>
The film <i>Henry and June</i> portrayed four significant "female" characters
(we place the word `female' in scare quotes because part of the problem
of this paper is to question what the word can mean). Two additional female
characters appeared in the film, whom we do not term `significant' -- although
it should be admitted that these two both appeared on screen about as much
as one of the characters whom we term `significant', and that, further,
one of those whom we do not term `significant' had spoken lines while one
whom we do so term did not. We believe that all other women who appeared
on screen at all were extras rather than actors, or at least had such small
parts as to be reasonably excluded from consideration (not, of course,
that we should assume that they were, for example, "heterosexual" either
-- we can simply say nothing about them).
<p>The non-candidates. Why, first of all, does the author consider every
"woman" who so much as appears on screen at all, even if briefly? It would
be more usual not even to consider the "insignificant" characters about
whom no question arises. However, certain of the theories which will be
discussed will claim that there is something essentially gendered and/or
essentially sexual about every representation; and, after all, nothing
makes it on to the screen "accidentally." If, for example, every gaze is
a male gaze -- if women use their eyes for something fundamentally different
than what men use theirs for -- then even those characters who are seen
in only the most fleeting glimpse are nonetheless seen from a gendered
perspective (which does not answer the further question whether they are
also seen as gendered and/or sexualized).
<p>First non-candidate. A maid is portrayed in the film who a) knows about
certain sexual acts/relations portrayed; b) is Catholic; c) is alarmed
at certain sexual acts/relations she believes to exist, and may or may
not be alarmed also at those which we the audience "know" to exist. She
is not, however, portrayed as being involved in any sexual acts/relations
(nor is the possibility specifically excluded) -- other than insofar as
the act of observing or being aware of sexual or gendered acts may itself
be a sexual or gendered act; but insofar as this may be true, she is not
portrayed in a principally different position than that in which we, the
audience, actually stand. We shall, hence, take the maid to fall under
the same consideration as the audience.
<p>Second non-candidate. One of the main characters, June, has a female
"lover" outside of the main scene of the film (in NYC, rather than in Paris).
We view this "loved" woman only indirectly. She is presented only through
the imagination/memory of the title character, Henry, which we experience
in visual and auditory images; and through the spoken words of other characters,
mostly June. She is portrayed, that is, only in the presentation of an
act of observation which is clearly intended to be homologous with the
act of observation which we film viewers engage in. This portrayal may
or may not completely or correctly reflect our acts as film viewers, since
we only see the male observer seeing, and only see the female observer
talking. Whether this difference in what the film viewers see reflects
a different way in which genders observe -- or whether, indeed, such a
claim is actually made by the film makers -- is an issue to which we will
return. Let it suffice for now that the homology between our own gaze and
that gaze we gaze at suffices to allow the consideration only of the sexuality
and gender of the audience. Our assumption, for the moment, will be that
whatever conclusions we reach about the audience will apply willy-nilly
to the character Henry in his observing of the "lesbian" acts/relation
between June and her (NYC) "lover."
<p>The four possible lesbians in the film are An&auml;is (Nin), June (Miller),
the prostitute who looks like June, and the prostitute who looks like An&auml;is
(neither of the latter two are given names in the film, which presents
a slight problem for what to call them: they shall be referred to according
to whom they symbolically substitute for, i.e. `June's alternate'). In
addition, a possibility arises with the audience. Perhaps it is possible
that there is a lesbian in the audience (though during one of the showings
we saw, a certain "lesbian" concerned with this question of "who is a lesbian"
walked out of the film -- need we name names?). Of course, to be bluntly
literal, if there is one lesbian in the audience of the film then there
are probably several -- but the question which really arises is of the
possibility of there being any lesbians in the audience, not of the absolute
or relative number of them. A flat-footed reader could, of course, point
out that in a certain sense there are most certainly lesbians in the audience;
but we think this misses the point a bit. The point is that what constitutes
a "woman" as a lesbian is perhaps very different from, or even opposite
to, what constitutes her as a subjectivity which gazes. So we're told,
frequently enough.
<p>The subtext, or subplot, of the film, around which these possibilities
arise, is as follows. Whether this text is more or less important to the
film as a whole than are other features is not a matter on which the author
holds any particular opinion. Henry comes to Paris. An&auml;is meets him
and feels a sexual desire for him. June joins Henry in Paris. An&auml;is
feels a sexual desire for her, which may be, in large part, an extension
of her desire toward Henry (she has one fantasy in which June has a penis).
June leaves Paris. Henry and An&auml;is have many sexual acts together
(this may or may not be incidental to the relevant subtext). An&auml;is
visits, with her husband, the brothel where the prostitutes who look like
her and June work; and June's alternate and An&auml;is' alternate put on
a sexual "exhibition" for An&auml;is (with her husband watching also).
After the alternates perform a variety of tribadic acts, in an obviously
"heterosexual" style, An&auml;is tells June's alternate to "stop acting
like a man." The alternates then have cunnilingus, with June's alternate
(who is larger, and looks more "masculine") taking the "active" role and
An&auml;is' alternate "receiving" the act. The words in scare quotes are
not quite right, but they do carry the conventional meanings given to the
sexual positions. We are meant to judge by their facial expressions that
the alternates enjoy the latter act more. June comes back to Paris. An&auml;is
and June start to sexually "pet" each other, but any further sexual acts
are interrupted by facts external to this subtext. Then the film is over.
<h2>
<b>Pornography and the "male" gaze.</b></h2>
Here is a very peculiar fact: In the USA, most representations of women
engaged in sexual acts with each other, or with themselves, are viewed
for purposes of arousal (or listened to, read, etc.) much more often by
men than by women. The reason why this is so peculiar is that processes
of "identification" just cannot explain it. One can easily imagine that
"heterosexual" men would be able to see images of women engaged in "heterosexual"
acts with other men and find an erotic identification in positing themselves
as the man represented. Such a identification could be of the nature of:
"That man is engaged in that sexual act, and I, being, like him, a man,
could similarly be engaged in that sexual act." Indeed, this is clearly
an identificatory process which does occur. However, images of women engaged
in sexual acts with other women are probably consumed by men, for erotic
arousal, in greater quantity than are those images of "heterosexual" acts
which were mentioned. While it is by no means impossible, or even implausible,
that essentially the same identificatory process occurs between these men
and one or more of the women represented, this process simply cannot explain
the predominance of this type of image. What makes this predominance paradoxical
is that, apparently, two (or more) women engaged in a sexual act "do not
need a man" thereby -- and hence there is no represented sexual relation
in which a male viewer should be able to imagine himself having a place.
<p>Several explanations for the "male" arousal in observing "lesbian" acts
present themselves. According to a certain Freudian story, men (and women)
come to see their mothers as lacking something; namely, the possession
of mom's object of desire. This mythic object ("the Phallus") comes to
be represented by a penis, which a male child sees himself as possessing
(however tenuously). Through this process, the story goes, male sexual
desire comes to be defined by the possibility of fulfilling mom's desire
with the use of a penis -- or the desire of her later substitutes. Let
us call this the `Freudian explanation'. An adult, sexual (and heterosexual)
male sees a lack, an unfulfilled desire, when he sees a woman; and he wishes,
through a sexual direction of the drive, to fulfill her unfulfilled desire
through sexual intercourse with her, wherein she comes into temporary possession
of his penis. In viewing an image of a woman, this man sees such a lack,
and such a lack is simply accentuated by her portrayal as sexually aroused
-- and nothing could better demonstrate her sexual arousal than her actually
engaging in a sexual act. However, if a man is portrayed in the same image,
then the woman (or women) portrayed in the image are no longer lacking
anything which the viewer might potentially fulfill, since the man portrayed
is already filling this lack.
<p>According to another story (not contradictory of the first story), there
is a overwhelmingly prevalent convention in the media and arts to portray
women when they portray (hetero)sexual acts. Let us call this the `empiricist
explanation'. When heterosexual acts are portrayed in film and images (and
also, largely, in literature and song), the portrayal is from a male point
of view. Typically, the camera looks over a man's shoulder on to a woman's
face -- most particularly at the stylized "moment of climax" (a peculiar
thing, unquestionably, that in film heterosexual couples always both have
orgasms, and always at the same moment). According to the empiricist explanation,
observers are able to perform an induction from the series of film and
literary representations they view to the conclusion that all images of
women aroused are, so to speak, "shot from over a man's shoulder." When
an observer accustomed to seeing these androcentric (in the narrowest and
most literal meaning -- or, perhaps `androlocal') images sees an image
directly portraying only women, she or he nonetheless inserts an imagined
"male shoulder" into the frame of the picture. We use both pronouns in
the previous sentence most deliberately: it must, under this theory, really
be both men and women who take on, by empirical induction, an androcentric
viewpoint. The empiricist explanation, although at first appearing less
fundamental than the Freudian one, in reality goes further towards making
the claim that it cannot be a "lesbian" observing sexualized images of
women.
<p>The claim, then, which was mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph:
every pornographic image of a woman (or of a man?) is an image which supposes
a male viewer. Furthermore, according to those who make this claim, any
such image cannot really be an image of a "lesbian" act because it always
has immanent within it a lack which demands for its fulfillment that a
man enter the frame. This claim, or a subspecies of it, is one made by
some feminists -- and by a large number of distinctly anti-feminists --
within the "anti-pornography camp." Those who make this claim -- let us
call it the "essential androcentrism of pornography" claim -- often find
theoretical support in one or both of the two explanations which were sketched
above. As is obvious, this claim entails that the conclusion of this paper
be, "there are no, and could be no, lesbians in the film <i>Henry and June</i>,
neither on screen nor in the audience."
<h2>
<b>Other uses for eyes.</b></h2>
Let us focus, again, on the Freudian explanation. If men (or someone) see
by seeing a lack, then those who are their abstract negation must see by
seeing presence. This is not yet anything near a determinate negation --
so the Hegelian credo against it is in force -- but we may make several
comments on seeing presences. First, this is not far from certain anti-porn
-- mostly "lesbian" -- ideologies which claim that what lesbians do is
somehow not "objectify" their "lovers." They treat them as whole persons,
and
not as single sexual aspects, according to this faith. `Objectify' as used
here has a somewhat special sense which is not entirely clear, but which
clearly has something to do with conceptions or stereotypes about sex.
However, if we take the notion of seeing presences fully into account,
we will also take `objectify' in a fully Kantian sense. Those whom we do
not objectify we do not view as objects in the world having such "hidden"
lacks as causal connections to the world and substantial existence. This
is not meant as a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, however, as the second point
will, perhaps illustrate.
<p>Second, all representational art is an art of lacks or absences. For
example, any painting showing perspective brings a viewer to mentally insert
a dimensionality into the painting which she knows is "lacking" in the
two-dimensional frame; and any portrait showing a right profile brings
a viewer to imagine the left profile which is only an absence within the
portrait. What is represented in realism is represented as inadequate and
lacking -- at least as we are taught to see these things. Certain non-representational
art may not be an art of absences. Abstract-expressionism would be a bad
example, since one is taught to see in it artists' emotions; but perhaps
Jackson Pollock paintings are an adequate example. Or perhaps, in a very
different way, Vassily Kandinsky is not a painter of absences (this author
does not think Kandinsky's inherited theory of the relations between human
emotion and color-form vitiates this possibility, since he never supposed
the relation to be representational). We cannot discuss herein these particular
artists, but let us allow that at least a possibility is presented by them
of another way of seeing which does not see absences<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>.
<h2>
<b>What is a lesbian, anyway?</b></h2>
Let us make a start by excluding most definitions of this word, `lesbian'.
Simply saying that "a lesbian is a woman who loves women" is itself enough
of a conundrum to occupy us for a while. For a start, and simplistically,
we should observe that the word `love', in this context, certainly has
something to do with sex; we should throw out all those senses of the word
which do not carry any such meaning. But what does the word `love', suitably
defined, have to do with sex? Letting the word refer to sexual acts is
at once both too much and not enough. On the one hand, even "women" who
do not engage in "lesbian" sexual acts may be "lesbians" in the common
sense manner of having sexual desires exclusively for "women." On the other
hand, "women" who do engage in sexual acts with each other may do so in
a manner which only is meaningfully a "sexual act" in relation to a male
scoptophile -- even if they do so in private, and not in front of a camera.
Let us attempt, for the moment, the narrowest, and least inclusive, reading
of the word `love' we can find, so that we may find, perhaps, at least
a stable tool with which to identify (some) lesbians. Let us require that
`love' must be taken in the sense of "a sexual act engaged in with the
true `object' of one's desire."
<h2>
<b>Well then, what is a woman?</b></h2>
Several theories come to mind, and theories, like many things, carry deceptive
proper names. All the theories to follow, perhaps, agree on the point that
a woman is not a man; but this agreement is a most specious thing, since
the manner and meaning of not being a man differs greatly between them.
Many more theories than are presented could be, and no claim is made that
these are the best, the most representative, the most popularly held, or
even the most interesting.
<p><u>The Julie Simpson theory.</u> G<sup>tm</sup>enders<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
are clusters of traits. G<sup>tm</sup>enders are assigned on the basis
of biological sex, which is determined, at least socially, by outward genitalia.
Having had gender determined at birth (or before) by naive empiricists
(i.e. their parents who look at their genitals), women or men get certain
sexual and economic roles and behaviors regularly prescribed differentially,
and hence get different self-conceptions about these roles and behaviors.
Although the particular roles assigned to gendered persons are completely
socially contingent, genders must be two in number since that is, after
all, the number of biological sexes out of which we can form gender classifications.
Besides, every society has a need for a normative heterosexuality in order
to biologically reproduce itself; and the binary categories of gender are
necessary for this imperative to make sense. The relation between genders,
once removed from their basis in sex, is not structural, and is theoretically
symmetrical (not, of course, "practically" symmetrical in the sense of
economically symmetrical, and so on). That is, each gender is a positive
pole around which traits cluster. Although the terms `man' and `woman'
are often taken as antonyms, the actual traits each referent takes on are
not opposites, but simply different. To this theory, a lesbian is not anything
in particular, merely someone with the feminine cluster of traits who loves
someone near the same cluster. Of course, given the heterosexual norm around
which the genders are formed, a lesbian is a relatively unlikely thing
-- but this is a question of probability only, not of logic.
<p><u>The Karen Adkins theory.</u> To be is, firstly, to be a man. A man
is a person, <i>sui generis</i>, and being woman is simply a derivative
way of being. These categories (of gender) are social, though, not psychological
in the fashion of the Lacanians and so many others. It is not a question
of the psychological centrality of the category of Otherness around which
the concept of woman is formed, and into which each of us inserts herself
either on the side of presence or that of absence. It is instead a question
of social fringes. Just as there could not be slaves without masters, there
could not be women without men. The converse, however, in neither case
applies: there could be masters without slaves, and men without women.
In explaining the gender of sexuality, the Adkins theory reverses the Freudian
thing. R<sup>tm</sup>ather than explaining the essential feminine genderedness
of sexual objects (vis-a-vis their "lack"), we are given an essential masculine
genderedness of sexual subjects. Since it is social persons who have sexual
desires and act sexual acts, it is those who "assume the male position"
who do so. For this theory, a lesbian is an impossible thing, at least
if it refers to anything beyond genitalia. Since at least one person in
every sexual act must be acting as a man does, there can be no sexual act
between "women." There is actually a certain freedom given by this theory,
however. Since everyone can act as a man does, and since it matters not
a whit theoretically with whom we have our sexual acts, we are freed from
restrictions on our sexual choice -- the theory can contain no prescriptions
on what we must do (unlike Freudianism, and so many other theories). Another
name under which the prescription of this theory travels is `androgyny'.
<p><u>The Humbertoldi-Whorf hypothesis.</u> G<sup>tm</sup>ender is a linguistic
category. Indo-europeans have two genders; or in many cases three, but
where three, only two are typically genders of persons. Bantus have many
more -- fifteen in Swahili, for example -- three or more of which are always
genders of people. Since the structure of consciousness is wholly a consequence
of the structure of language, a consciousness which divides the world with
gender as a fundamental split must emerge from a language which speaks
gender. And indeed, gender certainly is an absolutely fundamental category
for us Indo-europeans -- as fundamental as those other well-known linguistic
categories: "space," "time" and "object." Just as those consciousnesses
which speak languages (such as Hopi) which lack the words for "space,"
"time" and "object" -- or, better, replace them with other words -- lack
such concepts, a language without categories of "gender" would be spoken
by consciousnesses without the concept of them. Just as many political
battles are fought over the utilization of fundamental linguistic categories
such as "space" and "time" -- for example, in struggles over the geographic
demarcation and division of space, or over the Taylorist industrial regulation
of time on the shop floor -- so also are political wars waged over the
utilization of the category of gender (need we actually name some? -- childcare,
wage-differential, reproductive rights, rape are a few). But none of these
struggles over the concrete utilization of linguistic categories are necessarily,
or even likely, struggles against the categories themselves. Rarely do
workers protest the speed up of an assembly line through a call for an
elimination of the Indo-european category "time;" and even more rarely
do feminists protest against inequitable wages though a call for an elimination
of the category "gender" (Indeed, it is difficult for us Indo-europeans
to understand what sense could be made of such a call). We do not claim
that linguistic categories, even the most fundamental ones, do not change;
nor still less that history is anything more than the history of class-struggle.
But it is extremely rare that a political stuggle which comes to cause
a change of such a fundamental category can have its meaning contained
in any individual, or even collective, synchronic consciousness.
<p>In application to the topic of this paper, the Humbertoldi-Whorf thesis
has a sharply politicizing effect. The thesis synchronically fixes the
gender categories around which the meaning of "lesbian" has been given,
but simultaneously denies any fixedness in the empirical or practical application
of the categories. Certainly the reactionaries (such as Sigmund Freud or
Andrea Dworkin) may continue their claim that one of those "women" in the
frame, or in front of it, must actually be a "man." But it also remains
possible to fight for an application of the categories according to which
all the "women" are women.
<p><u>The Jeremy Barris thesis:</u> Lacan's big thing (say `th<i>aaay</i>ng'<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>).
Although we must confess that our first reflex is to gag when we have this
thing in our throat, we will push on to the thrust of the theory. Perhaps
there is a seminal idea in there somewhere which we can succeed in teasing
out. Desire always involves the posit of a lack -- a lack of something,
the Phallus, which was a fraud to start with, but a lack, nonetheless.
This lack can be posited on either side of the sexual act; or rather, it
must be posited simultaneously on both sides, but in different ways. Sexual
desire contains a lack which is actually the lack of a lack. Mom lacks
the object of her desire, and in order to imagine we can fulfill it we
must imagine we lack this lack, for we could not have the object she lacks
if we too lack it. From the "masculine" side we find that the something
which we have which is the lack of a lack is the Phallus -- or a penis
(which is not a vagina). Then, having found and named our masculine lack
of a lack we must find a desire which lacks what we have, since, after
all, our lack of a lack was found in order to fulfill a lack which lacks
our lack of a lack. <i>Ipso Facto</i>, goes the masculine deduction, a
woman must be a person who lacks our lack of a lack -- for who else could
it be. From the "feminine" side we find that what we have is a lack which
is the lack of a lack of a lack (a vagina), since according to those who
tell us what we have, that presence (which is a lack) which men have which
mom lacks is a lack we lack. Structurally, this thing allows more possibilities
than have the other theories we've discussed.
<p>We can first notice, that a sexuality which saw presences which were
not actually those absences which were the absences of absences (a sexuality
which was Egyptist rather than Impressionist) could not be a sexuality
which saw genders -- at least not those two old genders: female and male.
Those two genders which are so familiar are the genders of those who lack
a lack, or who lack this lack of a lack. Not that such an Egyptist sexuality
might not be an awfully good thing, but it certainly could not be a "lesbian"
sexuality if our definition of a lesbian ("A woman who loves women") can
still be accepted. We cannot say yet whether any sexuality of the candidates
might actually be the one mentioned, but this possibility stands open as
the most interesting one encountered. On the other hand, even if what we
see in sexual images is a lack, that does not restrict the possible sexual
relations within and to the image too much. It may be that the viewer of
"lesbian" images thinks he has that lack of a lack (the Phallus) which
the "women" in the image lack -- and indeed there surely are such viewer
who have penises, but also there are such viewers who have vaginas. Both
"men" and "women" may stand in this "masculine" relation to "lesbian" images,
since what made sexuality possible for either was an original positing
of a lack of a lack of what mom lacks. Just because "women" are later told
that they lack this lack of a lack does not mean that the do not also lack
mom's lack -- there are just simply other ways of lacking a lack than having
a penis (though "the Phallus" is just simply this lack of a lack -- which
we all have). This is still a "masculine" relation to the images, however.
A more subversive relation would be one where a viewer takes a "lesbian"
image to show the basic fraud to the idea that what a "woman's" lack lacks
is that "masculine" lack of a lack: the Phallus which is the penis. Instead,
a subversive "woman" simply lacks as she likes, lacks what she wishes to
lack. There are as many lesbians in the film as there are subversives who
show the fraud of the Phallus (how many is this? We'll return to this).
<p><u>The Alison Brown provocation.</u> G<sup>tm</sup>ender is transvestism.
It is a fraud we put on by wearing certain clothes, adopting certain facial
expressions, walking certain ways, etc. Let us make a distinction within
transvestism, however, between "simple transvestism" and "transsexuality."
Of course, those who usually call themselves TV's and TS's know these are
two different things -- but only some would agree with the particular manner
of distinction to follow. Let us say that "simple" transvestites put on
a fraud which is formally deceptive; while transsexuals put on a fraud
which is formally "truthful." In any case -- as TV's and TS's know better
than anyone -- there is no possible representational or causal connection
between form of appearance and the "truth" of gender (for if there were,
a transsexual could not have been born in the body which s/he was). Every
form of appearance (whether voluntary, such as makeup and dress; semi-voluntary,
such as physical build; or involuntary, such as genitalia) makes a specious,
and completely fraudulent claim to "represent" gender. But some of us believe
that the claim made by our outward appearance is "true," though this truth
is in no way indicated or represented, nor is the true "truth's" claim
made, by outward appearance; and some of us believe the claim is false.
While some of us gain our greatest pleasure in that most delicate joy,
deception, others of us gain our pleasure from that most rarified form
of deception called "truthfulness."
<p>Sexual choices, insofar as they are pure kinds (though no real person
is ever so pure) are not two in number as is often said -- male or female
and/or homosexual or heterosexual -- but are sixteen in number, in a society
such as ours which allows just two social genders. There are those who
fraudulently dress as men in order to "represent" their male gender who
have sex with those who fraudulently dress as men in order not to "represent"
a male gender; there are those who fraudulently dress as women in order
not to "represent" a female gender who have sex with those who fraudulently
dress as women in order to "represent" a female gender; there are those
who fraudulently dress as women in order not to "represent" a female gender
who have sex with those who fraudulently dress as men in order not to "represent"
a male gender; and there are thirteen other permutations which we do not
list, but which the reader can easily imagine. Of course, if one insists
on fetishizing genitalia then one will say that on each side of the types
of sexuality we have mentioned there are at least two types of people.
That is, for example, while there are those with male genitalia who fraudulently
dress as men in order not to represent their male gender, there are equally
those with female genitalia who fraudulently dress as men in order not
to represent their male gender. If this canard is admitted then sexual
choices are sixty-four in number. Of course, it can be added that there
have always been a few of those who dress in gendered attire, not in order
to perpetuate a fraud about the truth or falsity of gender, but simply
in order to be able to achieve a goal (for example, "women" who have dressed
as men, not in order to fraudulently claim the "truth" of their female
gender, but simply in order to be allowed passage through a particular
geographic area).
<p>What is a lesbian? A lesbian is someone with any of many different sexual
choices and gender identities. How many lesbians are there in the film
under discussion? We may say there are more than five, and perhaps many
more. At least the five candidates are lesbians, though most may be several.
The audience, certainly, according to this provocation, contains not one,
but many kinds of lesbians. But within the frame several different lesbians
are often seen within the same character. For example, An&auml;is, when
she first imagines herself having sex with June, is a "woman" who loves
a woman who fraudulently wears a female body in order to "represent" a
male gender. The rarified deception (the "truth") of the imagined June
is her male gender -- she has a penis. However, in order to represent this
"truth," June must wear a female body. However, later -- after An&auml;is
has seen through the particular fraud which was involved in the "exhibition"
she watched -- An&auml;is is a "woman" who loves a woman who wears a female
body either in order to "represent" her female gender or in order not to
"represent" her female gender (we need not try specify which). Further,
we have not said with what purpose An&auml;is wears her own female body,
or whether this purpose changes within the film. Our point is simply that
the film under discussion represents many different lesbians in many different
ways.
<h2>
<b>The Conclusions.</b></h2>

<table BORDER COLS=3 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td VALIGN=TOP>As we have shown, there really are no lesbians in the film
<i>Henry
and June</i>, despite the film-makers' best attempts to put them into the
film. The film-makers' consciousness of the dilemma of the essential androcentrism
of pornography is not in itself sufficient to overcome such an essential
bias in film representation. As we have mentioned, the brothel scene where
an "exhibition" is put on is an obvious effort to overcome the androcentrism
mentioned. By having An&auml;is recognize the androcentrism of the exhibition
-- in which women are presented as possibly sexual only in relation to
men, even if the men may be only vicariously present -- the film-makers
attempted to overcome this androcentrism. However, the level at which the
film-makers (and perhaps An&auml;is Nin herself, in her book of the same
title as the film) make this critique is far too superficial. They suppose
that it is simply the particular sexual acts and positions involved in
androcentric pornography which makes it androcentric. At a certain naive
level this criticism is correct -- women portrayed in pornography are typically
placed in "heterosexual" positions -- but it supposes that androcentrism
is confined to certain arrangements of limbs, and does not extend to the
basic psychic composition of sexualized and gendered beings. Of course,
after An&auml;is tells the prostitute to, "stop acting like a man," the
latter changes sexual acts -- and engages in one that is, perhaps, statistically
more frequent among lesbian than heterosexual lovers. But the prostitutes'
"lesbian" sexual act is still an act which is observed, and which is performed
to be observed. This act -- existing to be observed -- still contains implicit
within it an essential lack of the symbolic Phallus. Since these women
depend on an observer who socially represents the Lacanian "law of the
father," they are not, and cannot be, represented as whole sexual beings,
but only as beings lacking something they can not supply themselves. Physiologically
An&auml;is may also not have a penis (and some of the audience does not),
but as an observer she claims to be able to fulfill a sexuality which women
by themselves cannot fulfill. Indeed, insofar as women are ever "exhibited"
it is always in the context of this of this same implicit androcentric
claim, and is not as lesbians.</td>

<td>Our critique of the male gaze allows us to seperate out those women
in the film who are lesbians from those who, though engaging in sexual
acts with women, engage in acts from a fundamentally masculine perspective.
In particular, An&auml;is and the audience both stand on the side of the
essentially male viewer, whatever their physiological "sex." The other
characters, June, the two prostitutes -- and June's NYC lover, by the same
token -- although being drawn into a system of male (hetero)sexuality when
they become objectified by representation, are in themselves, and in their
sexual relations to each other, lesbians. As Lacan has observed, the origin
of signification comes with the mythological "transcendental signifier,"
the Phallus. Anyone claiming the power to understand signification is,
at heart, assuming a male power. A relation to an image can only be mistaken
for a relation to a thing (if indirect) if one assumes the "truth" of the
Phallus; that is, if one assumes one has the Phallus, and hence the power
of signification. Although persons of both biological "sexes" sometimes
claim this mastery, it is only in the structural role of the male gender
that they make this claim.
<p>It is exactly this claim mentioned above which differentiates An&auml;is
and the women in the audience from the other women in the film. An&auml;is
(and the audience) claims such mastery, the rest do not. An&auml;is has
sexual fantasies which are shown to us in terms of full visual and audial
images, where the rest of the women characters act out their sexual passions
solely through sexual actions (including, for example, facial expressions).
A representation of sex, however, makes a claim to mastery of signification
which a mere (non-representational) action does not. Three further observations
accentuate this contrast between An&auml;is (which includes the audience)
and the other characters. First, as we mentioned June's NYC lover is shown
to us in two different ways. When shown through a male observer, Henry,
she is "fully" represented in audio-visual imagery; when shown through
a female observer, June, she can only be spoken about, and then only hestitantly
and vaguely. A woman observing makes no claim to be able to "master" and
<i>re</i>-present
what she sees -- not so with a man. On this An&auml;is is clearly on the
male side -- indeed, the whole film is based on a book she wrote. Second,
An&auml;is is, like Henry, a writer. Not only is this another general claim
to mastery of signification, but, specifically, An&auml;is, like Henry,
claims the mastery necessary to write a book about -- and hence "master"
-- June. An&auml;is claims a "male" ability to control the representations
of women; she claims, particularly, to be identical to Henry in her ability
to represent. Third, even in relation to the "actual" sexual acts shown
on screen, An&auml;is stands in the observer's position. She watches --
and even "commands" -- the women carrying out their various sexual acts.
Every women other than An&auml;is (and the audience who think they are
in a position to understand) makes no such claim, in any form, to be able
to <i>re</i>-present sexual acts -- they merely engage in them without
representation. Only these other women are truly "lesbian."</td>

<td>An&auml;is is the character in the film <i>Henry and June</i> who most
clearly indicates the possibility of a truly lesbian sexuality. While we
cannot claim <i>tout court</i> that all the other candidates mentioned
are still constrained within a heterosexist sexual norm, neither can we
show that any of them have completely escaped it. In brief, the "masculine"
relation to sexuality which An&auml;is escapes is, as we have discussed,
one which constructs the lack within feminine desire as a lack of that
particular lack which is represented by the penis (the `Phallus' is the
general name, absent its physiological token). Desire, insofar as it is
constructed in a female subject must have followed this particular phallic
etiology. Most women, probably, do not ever develop a desire which goes
beyond a desire in relation to the Phallus -- except in the most trivial
way of psychically following a linear series of displacements from the
Phallus to objects which serve in every way as the substitute for the Phallus.
Even women who have sex with other women do not necessarily do so in a
manner which takes their partner for anything but another representation
of the phallic principle. A true "lesbian" sexuality, however, would be
one which completely severed the linear series of displacements from the
Phallus, and inserted a completely new object of desire with no connection
to the series of phallic substitutes. To write language which has been
written in this paper previously: a "lesbian" sexuality would involve a
transvaluation of values rather than a mere re-evaluation of particular
objects.
<p>An&auml;is carries out just the kind of transvaluation necessary to
create a "lesbian" sexuality in the course of her character's development
within the film -- indeed, this very exodus is the main story told in the
film. While the film does not preclude the possibility that other characters
have carried out such a transvaluation, neither does it actually show them
carry it out (though there are some hints given for June in the way she
talks of "becoming innocent"). At first, An&auml;is is clearly governed
by "the phallic law" -- she does, after all, only imagine sex possible
with June if June is imagined with a penis. However, An&auml;is' comment
to the prostitutes at their "exhibition" to "stop acting like a man" shows
that she has conceived of the possibility of rupturing the series of displacements
from the Phallus, and of inserting, voluntarily and in a life-affirming
manner, whatever lack one wishes. When she later has sex with June we are
to assume that she has chosen June as the lack she wishes to insert as
object of her sexual desire, not because of some unconscious displacement,
but freely and voluntarily. The scene in which she has sex with her friend,
Eduard, further shows this new sexuality of voluntary choice -- though
Eduard is a man, she chooses him, not as belonging to the male gender,
but as a singular sexual partner. This is precisely what a "lesbian" sexuality
is: a sexuality of singularities rather than of gendered types.

Footnotes.</h2>
<a NAME="N_1_"></a>1. <font size=-1>A system of homologies can be seen
within the matrix of artistic and "moral" ideas which have been discussed.
First, it seems obvious enough that what is really being discussed with
the idea of "a different use for eyes" is a different system of valuation
at a fundamental level -- as opposed to simply a change in values. This
will clearly remind us of Nietzsche's two value tables: those of Good/Bad
and Good/Evil. To gloss the two tables we may point out that the former
is
a direct valuation, while the latter is only a refractory valuation. Where
the "master" says "I am good," and "you are bad" follows only as a corollary,
the "slave" says, "You are bad, therefore I must be good." For the slave,
what poses as the positive term of the value table (in purely grammatical
terms, even -- "how good?" is a "neutral" question while "how bad?" is
a "loaded" question) is only arrived at by the negation of the negative
term.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The same is true of the notion of "presence" which can
be found in representational art. A presence in representational art (and,
indeed, there is always
<i>something</i> within the frame) always contains
a whole system of absences implicit within it. This type of presence is
always a refractory and indirect one. "Impressionism" which is popularly
misconceived of as a painting of surfaces is a painting of presences only
in the refractory "slave morality." Dimensionality, for example, in it
is reduced to a minimum, but such a reduction is only possible in relation
to the possibility of representing an absent dimensionality, it is not
a complete "overcoming" of the possibility of dimensionality. Impressionists
are the petty yea-sayers and donkeys of the world, who simply affirm everything
without the possibility of denying them. They are like Christians, who
simply universalize the refractory concept of "good" without eliminating
its trace in the negation of evil.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The path to a possibly different sort of presence passes
through that art form almost universally called "Cubism," but better called
by its earlier name, "Egyptism." The better name itself signifies what
is going on in the art form. Rather than simply abstractly negate, never
successfully, the forms of perspective of realist art, as in Impressionism,
Egyptism returns to a specific and determinate non-perspectival form which
is not a possibility or inevitability within any kind of dialectic, material
or ideal, but is rather a specific historic event which can return. Similarly,
for Nietzsche, the Ubermensch is not a better human who negates particular
human faults, but is a different kind of being who overcomes humanness
by contingently becoming <i>like</i> the actual historical beings who valued
differently. Egyptism is not yet Jackson Pollock, but it presents a possible
path to him (as, indeed, the actual historical path led).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a>2. <font size=-1>The capital letters `G' and `R',
the letter combination `PG', and the letter/number combinations `PG-13'
and `NC-17' are trademarks of the American Ratings Board. The letter `X',
however, is not trademarked, and may be used by anybody without permission
of the Board. It was because of this lack of trademark, in part, that the
rating "X" was eliminated, and the insanely specious rating "NC-17" was
introduced. Of course, had it not beein for the new rating and its historical
importance of being the first "NC-17" film, I may well never have seen
the film discussed in this paper.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a>3. <font size=-1>A joke seems appropriate here: Anna
Freud, at the age of four, was having a certain amount of difficulty understanding
some of the finer points of her father's theories. She queried her father
on one of them, "Daddy, I'm having a hard time understanding part of the
psychoanalytic theories you've been telling me about. I don't quite understand
what the difference is between a penis and the Phallus." Freud, the good
pedagogue that he was, decided that rather than merely tell his daughter
about this distinction, he would show her. So Siggy unbuttoned his pants
and pulled out his penis, "This, Anna," he said, "is a penis." "Oh, I see,"
Anna said catching on, "so a penis is just like the Phallus, only smaller."</font>
<p><font size=-1>By the way, forgive the crudeness with which the Lacanian
theory is presented, but we can find no better way to present it (and is
Lacan's own lecture titled "The Freudian Thing" -- from which we derive
our section title -- really any different).</font>
