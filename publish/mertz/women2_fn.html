confirmation is given in the following recently published Associated Press

extent into the mainstream of American life, and many believe it probably never
will.  As for the typical American_someone who is straight, who is not very
promiscuous, who does not shoot drugs or knowingly sleep with those who do_most
experts agree the risk of AIDS falls somewhere between low and

<i>Semi-Annual Statistics</i> 1992; 67: 201-204.  Fifty-three African nations,
for example, report a combined cumulative incidence of 152,463 AIDS cases,
while the US reports 218,301 all by itself.  National reports to the 1992
report are typically through only early 1992, or even 1991, with a somewhat
greater delay on average in the reporting of African than US figures.  However,
it is clear that the US has many more AIDS cases than any single African
nation, and most likely more than the continent as a whole.<p>
<a name="fn22">[24]</a> CDC. <i>HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report</i>. op.cit.
According to this report, pediatric AIDS cases are approximately evenly divided
between the sexes, as one would expect.  However, these cases account for only
4,906 of all cumulative cases, and hence do not significantly affect the
percentages.  <p>
<a name="fn23">[25]</a> For example:  Rieder I, Ruppelt P. (eds.) <i>AIDS: The
Women</i>. San Francisco: Cleis Press, 1988;  Richardson D. <i>Women &amp;
AIDS</i>. New York: Methuen, 1988;  Panos Institute, op.cit;  Lester B.

Continuum, 1989.  <p>
<a name="fn24">[26]</a> CDC. op.cit.<p>
<a name="fn25">[27]</a> CDC. op.cit.  Since we have no reason to believe that
the breakdown of the actual risk-categories of those partners who did not
specify risk is significantly different from those of partners with specified
risk, we can safely assume that the vast majority of the men who allegedly pass
AIDS on to their female partners, including those with unspecified risk, are
IDUs.<p>
<a name="fn26">[28]</a> Sch&uuml;klenk U, Mertz D, Richters J. op.cit.  In
essence, our argument there is that studies of sexual transmission efficiency
of HIV male-to-female versus female-to-male, taken together with the base rates
for potentially infective partners, are inconsistent with the total numbers of
men and women reported in the heterosexual transmission category.<p>
<a name="fn27">[29]</a>  We know that at least some men lie about their risk
categories.  According to New York pulic health official Rand Stoneburner,
[[yen]]of 63 men (as of January 1989) who reported prostitute contact but
denied other exposure, 42 were later found to have a history of contact with
homosexual men or had engaged in intravenous drug abuse.[[pi]]  Outside of New
York City, thorough repeat interviews and contact tracing, which would reveal
such initial misreports, are not performed.  See Fumento. op.cit. ch.7.<p>
<a name="fn28">[30]</a> CDC. <i>HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report</i>. op.cit.<p>
<a name="fn29">[31]</a> Some of these 80,713 IDUs are women, however.  The CDC
document does not provide directly cumulative numbers of IDU female AIDS cases,
but from October 1992 through September 1993, there were 6,891 female IDU AIDS
cases and 19,142 male IDU AIDS cases.  The cumulative 80,713 IDU AIDS are
likely to break down in a ratio similar to this 1:3 ratio, i.e. there should be
approximately sixty thousand male IDU AIDS cases cumulatively.  See CDC.

<a name="fn30">[32]</a> Kinsey AC, Pomeroy WB, Martin CE. <i>Sexual Behavior in
the Human Male</i>. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1948.  Kinsey, for example,
shows only 2.9% out of 19.8% of 25-year-old men who have some homosexual
history are exclusively homosexual.  The remaining 16.9% of all men, or 85% of
men with some homosexual contacts, have some heterosexual contacts as well.
This study shows a similar pattern in other age groups, with 30- and
35-year-old men with some homosexual history being exclusively homosexual at an
even lower rate than 25-year-old men (but 20-, 40- and 45-year-old men having
somewhat higher ratios).  Kinsey's exact numbers have been disputed, but all
reputable quantitative sexologists have found that a significant majority of
[[yen]]men who have sex with men[[pi]] also have sex with women.  See, for
example, Masters WH, Johnson VE. <i>Homosexuality in Perspective</i>, Boston:
Little, Brown and Company, 1979; Harry J, DeVall WB. <i>The Social Organization
of Gay Males</i>, New York:  Praeger Publications, 1978; Hite, S. <i>Hite

increases of AIDS in women are among [[yen]]women who are heterosexual partners
of bisexual men (16%) or of intravenous drug users (67%).[[pi]]  Nonetheless,
she goes on to warn against casual sex between women and men.<p>
