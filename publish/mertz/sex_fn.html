Adams, Jad.  <i>AIDS: The HIV Myth</i>, St. Martin's: New York, 1989. See also,

<a name="fn4">[5]. </a>The simple noteworthy fact is that people sometimes fail
to report to their doctors their engagement in stigmatized activities, such as
homosexual intercourse and injection of illegal drugs.  Such underreporting is
facilitated by a widespread prior belief by doctors and patients that AIDS is,
<i>in fact</i>, being transmitted heterosexually in significant numbers.  Hence
patient reports of exclusively (non-stigmatized) heterosexual contact are an
easily accepted evasion of unpleasant inquiries from doctors.  However, more
than just as a general sociological observation about people's reticence about
stigmatized activities, the demographics of the reported heterosexual risk
category indicate that misreporting is occuring.  See Sch&uuml;klenk, Udo,
Juliet Ricther, David Mertz, "The Bioethics Tabloids: How Professional
Ethicists Have Fallen for the Myth of Tertiarily Transmitted Heterosexual
AIDS,"  <i>Health Care Analysis</i> 3(1), 1995;  Mertz, David, Mary Ann
Sushinsky, Udo Sch&uuml;klenk "Women and AIDS: The Ethics of Exaggerated Harm,"
Unpublished manuscript.<hr>
<a name="fn5">[6]. </a>Just how far cases declined is more difficult to say than
one might expect.  Unless the CDC changes its reporting procedures yet again,
it will become easier to quantify the 1994 decline when later reports are
issued.  My own estimate is that the real decline was of the order of about
1/3.  The actual reported numeric decline in the most recent report, between
the period July 1992-June 1993 and that of July 1993-June 1994, was small: from
85,122 to 84,268 adult/adolescent cases (CDC, <i>op. cit.</i>, Table 3).
However, as discussed in the main text, January 1993 saw a significant change
in the criteria for AIDS, which classified many more people as suffering from
the syndrome.  Since the earlier annual interval only contains six months under
the expanded definition, it is not fully comparable to the later interval in
direct numeric terms.  Under the 1987 and pre-1987 definitions of AIDS, there
was, in fact a decline in AIDS cases between July 1991-June 1992 and July
1992-June 1993 from 50,802 to 42,714, or a 16% decline (see Table 10,
<i>ibid</i>).  The reported figures by definition category for July 1993-June
1994 seem to be incomplete (although this is not indicated in the appropriate
chart), but of the 40,946 cases classified by definition category for this
first reporting interval fully under the 1993 expanded definition, 56% of cases
fell under the expanded definition.  Retroactive diagnosis of earlier cases,
because of the inherently incomplete information on which they are based, show
smaller percentages of cases which would have fallen under the 1993 expanded
definition had it been in effect in earlier reporting periods.<hr>

<a name="fn7">[8]. </a>Sch&uuml;klenk, Udo, David Mertz, Juliet Richters, "The
Bioethics Tabloids:  How Professional Ethicists Have Fallen for the Myth of
Tertiary Transmitted Heterosexual AIDS," <i>Health Care Analysis</i> 3:27-36,
1995.  See p.29 for discussion of this.  Also illustrative is De Vincenzi,
Isabelle, "A Longitudinal Study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by
Heterosexual Partners," <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> 331(6), August
11, 1994, which suggests that even heterosexual who have a known HIV
seropositive status use condoms from inconsistently to not at all with their
longterm partners who are known to be seronegative.<hr>
<a name="fn8">[9]. </a>The arguments which can be made against testing of
low-risk populations--or generally against treating HIV testing as a
<i>responsibility</i>, rather than a choice--are several, and beyond the scope
of this paper.  At the least, it can be observed that the rate of
false-positives probably exceeds the number of true positives for testing in
low-risk populations and, further, that no non-toxic or effective therapy
exists for AIDS treatment regardless of the accuracy of an antibody test.<hr>
<a name="fn9">[10]. </a>In defense of moralizing over safe-sex, and sometimes of
criminalizing "unsafe sex," the argument is often made that safe-sex advocates
are concerned not about <i>harm-to-self</i>, but rather about
<i>harm-to-others</i>.  A general Millean distinction between these types of
harm is assumed to be accepted on all sides; and I, in fact, endorse such a
distinction myself.  The question becomes one of whether engaging in unsafe sex
presents a nose at which my right to swing my fist ends.  I argue that there is
something a bit absurd about thinking of unsafe sex in these terms of
harm-to-others.  One simply cannot engage in non-masturbatory sex alone, and
hence any choice to engage in such acts--endangering or not--cannot be made
without the involvement of another person.  The moralizing safe-sex proponents
seem categorically to remove sex thereby from the realm of personal autonomy.
Further, given that universal awareness, or at least belief, of the danger of
AIDS in sex (at least in the U.S. and other places where AIDS education has
been widespread), it is implausible to maintain that by engaging in consensual
unsafe sex I might expose another to a risk of which she is unaware or does
not, in fact, deliberately choose.  This mutual consent to mutal endangerment
(which sex must be considered, quite regardless of any knowledge by one or both
partners of serological status), is much like the choice one makes by engaging
in a contact sport in which one chooses to risk a harm which, if inflicted,
will come at the hands of another person (who has also chosen a similar risk).
Ethicists and jurists have long recognized risks such as that of contact
sports--absent conduct well outside the bounds normal to the activity--as covered
by a civil-libertarian advocacy of rights to harm oneself, and legally as free
of liability to the causal agent of one's harm.  For much better elaboration of
this discussion, see Sch&uuml;klenk, Udo, "Rethinking Safe Sex, and (Mandatory)
HIV-Antibody Test Campaigns:  Some Doubts About the Role of 'Community Based'
AIDS Organisations," <i>Health Care Analysis</i> 2(3), 1994; Mohr, Richard D.,
"AIDS, Gays, and State Coercion," <i>Bioethics</i> 1(1): 35-50, 1987;

1990.<hr>
<a name="fn10">[11]. </a>See footnote .  In particular, between the discussed
intervals of July 1992-June 1993 and July 1993-June 1994, the decline in new
AIDS cases among men who have sex with men was from 47,533 to 42,156.  This
includes those cases who have an additional injecting drug use risk, but the
pattern is the same if they are excluded.  As discussed in the mentioned
footnote, this relatively small numeric decline represents a much larger
numeric decline under a constant definition of AIDS, since the case-definition
was greatly expanded during the latter interval.<hr>

of Venereal Disease in the United States Since 1880</i>, New York: Oxford
University Press, 1985.  See particularly, pp.12-17.  The mentioned ten percent
figure is by no means the highest estimate of syphlitic infection promoted in
the early twentieth century, either.  The assertion of Prince A. Morrow in 1911
is perhaps typical of estimates of venereal disease among social progressives,
"[The] morbidity of venereal disease exceeds that of all other diseases
combined."  Brandt, p.13.<hr>
