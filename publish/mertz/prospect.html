As I have indicated so many times before, the title of my dissertation
will be <cite>The Speculum and the Scalpel:  The Politics of Impotent
Representation and Non-Representational Terrorism.</cite> And the first
sentence will be, <em>Terrorism is politics without metaphysics; and
metaphysics, the textual form taken by [political] reaction.</em> I have
gotten a little way in the analysis of these words:  My project will, in
the first instance, be an outgrowth of much <em>anti-theoretical</em>
philosophy which runs from Nietzsche through such living, or recently
living, figures as Foucault, Deleuze, and Zizek (and hence Lacan).<p> My
first observation will be that words do not mirror the world.  Words
also do not resemble things (besides other words); words do not
<em>picture the world;</em> words do not describe the world; words do
not <em>refer to</em> the world.  Words have none of the mystical
properties philosophically (and commonly) ascribed to them, of standing
in some special, but always murky, relationship to other things.  Words
simply are events in the world.  Whatever regularity governs them is the
regularity of a fully material world.<p>

The problems with the above paragraph are evident.  For one, my
proclamation of materialism in the last paragraph can have no meaning.
My sentence <em>the world and its words are only material</em> can refer
to no world, because it denies its own referentiality.  So there is
simply <em>something</em> out there (where?) to which words do not refer.
Any effort to name, and hence hypostasize this  <em>something</em> (even my
own with my current word `something') is symptomatic of what Nietzsche
would call a <em>resentful consciousness;</em> i.e. a consciousness
which denies the unfixedness and, hence, indescribability of the
world.<p>

However, self-refutation is the lesser of two problems facing my
irreferentialism.  The arguments of self-refutation have already been
dealt with, in a somewhat different context <em> though I think
adequately </em> in the dissertation of Andrew Blais.  More serious is
na&iuml;ve irreferentialism's blindness to the subjective necessity of
the referentiality of language.  It is here that a reading of Lacan
becomes necessary.  Through the use of Lacan, and of the Lacanianism of
Zizek, I hope to be able to articulate the contradictory necessities
embedded in the referential pretense of all use of language.  As Zizek
writes in a slightly different context, <em>One cannot  <em>attain</em> it,
but one also cannot  <em>escape</em> it.</em> A major focus of my
dissertation will be to articulate, in several different concrete
contexts, what it means for linguistic phenomena to present themselves
subjectively as simultaneously  <em>necessary</em> and  <em>impossible</em>.
Such necessary and impossible linguistic phenomena will go by the very
general name `metaphysics' in my dissertation; though `metaphysics' will
be discussed mostly in its concrete instances, such as its manifestation
as nationalism, or as the U.S. <em>War on drugs.</em><p>

Associated with my irreferentialist and anti-realist program will be an
anti-semantic, pragmaticist program for linguistics.  I have written at
length (100 pages) on this topic before, for my honor's thesis.  I do
not wish simply to recycle what I wrote before on this topic, but
something roughly on the same track as that will be relevant background
for my dissertation.  The reason, now, why I wish to make a pragmaticist
(notice that linguistic  <em>pragmaticism</em> is not philosophical
 <em>pragmatism</em>) move is that I thoroughly believe in the
<em>linguistic turn.</em> Words are very important; they  <em>do
things</em>!  What I wish to do in my dissertation is to move the
paradigm of what words do from the dialectic and referential paradigm to
a politicized pragmatic paradigm.  It is for this purpose that I find
the following prototypes very important:  it used to be that the
<em>best case</em> of what language does was dialogue Socratic,
communicative, descriptive conversation which showed the essential,
inter-subjectively available, nature of things.  I prefer this:  the
<em>best case</em> example of what language does is a yell of
<em>Fire!</em> in a crowded theater.  All language does not more or less
resemble dialogue, subject only to various distortions; all language
more resembles a cry of <em>Fire!</em> subject, equally, to various
ideological distortions, various denials of the power struggles
contained in every utterance.<p>

As a tributary, at roughly this point in my dissertation, would have to
be a discussion of social-constructive accounts of science.  Science is
well known as the area of discourse which describes the world.  Other
discourses are more easily dismissed as being normative, meaningless,
non-literal, <em>et cetera</em>.  I believe that a presentation of
certain of the more radical, and de(con)structive paths pursued in the
Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) will allow me to dismiss the
whole referentialist theoreticism often characteristic of understandings
of science.  If I can smoke out referentialism from its home fort, I
stand a better chance of defeating it where things matter more.<p> As
can be seen already, my dissertation must be composed entirely of
tributaries and branches, with no more that the single word,
`irreferentialism' composing its linear flow.  The tributaries will
number about five in number; and may, perhaps, be labelled
<strong>PRAGMATICISM,</strong> <strong>SOCIAL-CONSTRUCTIVE
EPISTEMOLOGY,</strong> <strong>MATERIALISM,</strong>
<strong>BIOLOGY,</strong> and <strong>PSYCHO-ANALYSIS AND
PHENOMENOLOGY.</strong> Not all of these tributaries have even been
mentioned above, and none has been more than hinted at.  However, I
believe I will be able to demonstrate in a dissertation how critiques of
referentialism may be made under each of these titles.  The branches
will be of two general sorts.  Some will discuss concrete case-studies
of the functionings of referential necessity, such as
<strong>NATIONALISM,</strong> <strong>THE WAR ON DRUGS,</strong> and
<strong>THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE WORD `TERRORISM'.</strong> Others
will discuss, more abstractly (since any concretion flows to the other
main branch), referential impossibility.  <strong>THE LACANIAN
REAL,</strong> <strong>THE TERRORIST THING = X,</strong> and
<strong>SOREL'S MYTH AND SPONTANEISM</strong> are branches which could
derive from the second fork.  The meaning of each title mentioned above
cannot be discussed in this brief paper, but hopefully my efforts below
to clarify the general picture will allow the reader to guess the
meaning of each.<p>

All the above can only be the roughest preliminaries.  My real question
must be political.  How, if theories cannot describe the world, can
theory or discourse, in general - provide any guide to political
action?  How, even, can we ever speak and still recognize, let alone
prescribe, political actions?  This seems to me to be the first and only
question that can be asked within political theory.  It is the same
question appearing in the wonderful title of a famous book by Lenin,
<em>What is to be done?</em> To borrow another cliche (this time from
Sartre), <em>everything is political</em> - and since everything is, we
would like some guide to acting politically correctly, rather than in an
opposite manner.  All this is very basic, of course.<p> Let me return
briefly to the posturing I made above with a title and first sentence.
Let us just read it a bit more carefully, first:  <p>

        ALIGN="middle" ALT=" - "><em>The Speculum and the
        Scalpel:</em><p>

<DD>    Obviously, this is a metaphor whose terms are explicitly
        given in the subtitle.  .  . which I will get to.  A speculum is
        either of two things, and I wish to play off of both meanings.
        In the one case, from the Latin, it is a mirror; i.e. it stands
        for the whole Western metaphor of
        philosophy/science/theory/whatever as <em>the mirror of
        nature,</em> or the mirror of something else.  I wish, as I have
        written, to get rid of this metaphor.  Secondly, a speculum is a
        medical, primarily gynecological, instrument which opens, and
        hence reveals the contents of, a bodily orifice, usually a
        vagina.  Contrasted to a speculum is a scalpel.  A scalpel
        simply changes the state of a body, in a violent intervention,
        without making any pretense of either reflecting or revealing
        anything.  I know this is not entirely true, since there is such
        a thing as <em>exploratory surgery</em> (in fact, such will be
        my dissertation, I hope), but I think the contrast is OK.
        Sometimes the use of a scalpel does something <em>good</em> to a
        body.  I am not unaware, however, of clitoridectomy, etc.!<p>

<DT>    <IMG SRC="file:///c:/modem/homepage/htmlclip/dotbullet1.gif"
        ALIGN="middle" ALT=" - "> <em>The Politics of Impotent
        Representation and Non-Representational Terrorism.</em><p>

<DD>    <em>The body</em> is, in some sense, the <em>body politic</em>.
        I do not wish to say much about what organs, or what limbs this
        body has - for it is a great part of my purpose to problematize
        this very possibility.  Only by staying at a metaphorical level
        can I avoid - or partially avoid the error of claiming to
        represent the composition of this <em>body politic,</em> which
        is epistemically something like Kant's <em>noumena</em>.  If I
        were to state here that the body is composed of classes, or of
        genders, or of races, or of individuals in contradictory
        institutional roles, or something else like this, I would
        exemplify the first sort of politics:  impotent representation,
        metaphysics, and reaction.  Of course, this does not preclude
        using the same words, for example <em>the political world is
        divided into two contradictory classes whose conflict shapes
        history,</em> in other places, with other effects.<p>

        The phrase <em>impotent</em> suggests, of course, that <em>the
        body</em> is a sexual body in some sense.  I hope, though, that
        the sexuality of words is not understood in a narrow
        teleological directedness toward biological reproduction.
        Sexuality is neither the phallocentric directedness of an
        organism toward reproduction, nor a mere libidinal release
        a simply entropic effect.  Sexuality should instead be
        understood as Bataille does and/or as a <em>simply
        transformative force</em> with neither aim, origin, nor
        object.<p>

        Words can do many things.  However, let me paradoxically
        exemplify two of the things words almost always do:  words
        create representations and words intervene in existing
        representations.  Let us say, neither arbitrarily nor
        truthfully, that these two functions are always simultaneously
        present in any utterance; and that these two functions exhaust
        the taxonomy of utterance.<p>

<DT>    <IMG SRC="file:///c:/modem/homepage/htmlclip/dotbullet1.gif"
        ALIGN="middle" ALT=" - "> Terrorism is politics without
        metaphysics; and metaphysics, the textual form taken by
        [political] reaction!<p>

<DD>    The first function of words, exemplified in my taxonomy
        <em>perhaps epitomized by taxonomy in general</em> is
        metaphysics; it is what Nietzsche, according to my reading of
        Deleuze on Nietzsche and to my reading of Nietzsche himself,
        called <em>ressentiment</em>.<p>

        Here my deliberately careless reading, or perhaps outright
        misreading, will be recognized.  Would not a more defensible
        reading of Nietzsche consider the <em>creation</em> of
        representations <em>active</em>; and the mere <em>acting
        within</em> these given representations <em>reactive</em>, and
        hence resentful.  What would be missed by the
        <em>defensible</em> reading would be that the acting
        (<em>intervening</em>) <em>within</em> existing representations
        which I mention is specifically an acting <em>against</em> those
        representations.  To put it in a Spinozistic metaphysical figure
        (again, a <em>Deleuzian</em> Spinozism is indicated), the
        metaphysical use of words acts in a manner which pertains to the
        <em>composition</em> of existing representations, while the
        <em>terroristic</em> use of words is that which pertains to the
        <em>decomposition</em> of these representations.  In either case
        a semiotic closure is assumed:  words act upon words within
        language, but upon extra-linguistic <em>things</em> only as
        <em>noumena</em> act upon <em>noumena</em> i.e. in a manner
        about which we can <em>say</em> nothing.<p>

        The second function of words should not be named.  Naming this
        function, even, for example, calling it a <em>function</em> only
        exemplifies the metaphysical function of words.  Since one must
        write in the metaphysical mode at least in so far as one
        writes <em>about</em> something I will call this function
        <em>terrorism.</em> Why not?  Baudrillard writes about <em>the
        event</em> with the same purpose.  It is in the terrorist mode
        that Bataille, echoing Sade, likes sex, as that which exceeds
        all description and direction (it never was that way for my
        perhaps me readers have other experiences).  I cannot both
        exemplify and name the <em>terrorist</em> function of language.
        I can point to the yell of <em>Fire!</em> mentioned above, and
        say <em>that's what I mean.</em> I can mention that I
        think some of my memos have attempted to be terrorist.  But one
        cannot say what it is I am pointing at.  The best I can do,
        perhaps, is choose the particular word <em>terrorist</em> to
        name the function which opposes metaphysics.  Hearing the word
        especially hearing it fondly, passionately, sexually
        embraced and positively evaluated makes people react.  It
        heats tempers.  It prompts disbelief.  It spreads confusion.  It
        has many effects more difficult to name.  Good.<p>
</DL>

<strong>Objections.</strong> First it may be objected that the creation
of representations acts toward the decomposition of old representations;
that, in fact, my opposition itself denies the reality of flux/<em>the
being of becoming</em>/will-to-power, etc., since it pretends that there
is an entire mode of language (the metaphysical one) which leaves in
place representations.  Insofar as the opposition I make is a
metaphysical one, I am guilty, resentfully, of denying flux.  But the
level at which the objection operates is slightly different from that.
The advocate of the <em>being of becoming</em> of representations claims
that change is simply change <em>tout court</em>.  I disagree with
this.<p>

To understand my disagreement it is necessary to backtrack.  I should
mention, here while I backtrack, that I owe the problem of my possible
dissertation to Alison Brown; whose dissertation addressed precisely the
problem I have been discussing (though perhaps not in a manner easily
recognized).  I raised a question at Alison's dissertation defense.  I
asked, approximately, whether her notions of a demogenic self and
heterodemotic action her notations for her attempt to understand a
ground for radical political action attempted to find a position
outside of <em>Ideology</em>, or merely one opposed to particular
<em>ideologies</em> as Althusser has distinguished the capital 'I'
from the lower case 'i'.  In brief, Althusser distinguishes, with the
marker of capitalization, between the very Symbolic process of
subjectivation and the particular contents which are interpellated into
us.  Particular Ideological State Apparati (ISA's) fill, transiently,
subjectivity with content; and, in this sense, become temporarily
determinate.  However, the material base of subjectivation is referred
to with the capitalized `Ideology'.  Inasmuch as it is always
<em>subjects</em> into whom ISA contents are interpellated, there must
exist an <em>outsideless</em> Ideology which assure this interpellation
<em>in the last instance.</em> This is the meaning of Althusser.<p>

I was not satisfied that Dr. Brown gave an answer at that time (though
that was understandable given the circumstance).  However, let us
suppose that since she is both ambitious and optimistic she would wish
to find a position outside Ideology.  I am not nearly so optimistic.
The only notion I have of the political possibility of  <em>subjective</em>
actions, including and especially speech acts, is of acting against the
particular ideologies in which we find ourselves, not of acting against
Ideology.  However, I now believe that there exists a sense in which
anti-ideology can immanently constitute anti-Ideology but this sense can
be neither <em>subjective</em> nor <em>objective</em>, and hence cannot
be a <em>position</em> (but rather a <em>utopian moment</em>).  This is
the meaning of Adorno.<p>

Althusser supposes subjectivation works.  Suppose it doesn't.  Perhaps
when the Ideological imperative of subjectivation locates a desiring
subject within the Symbolic order it locates it in a position which
cannot be consistently held.  This is the meaning of Lacan.  Perhaps the
very material base of Ideology already contains within it contradictions
which are symptomatically expressed in the subjects into which it
interpellated itself.  This is the meaning of Zizek.  Perhaps after the
ground slips from under the speaking subject, she reemerges somewhere
quite different than in subjectivity.  This is the meaning of Deleuze
and Guattari.  These possibilities need to be explored.<p>

I will make a geometric metaphor.  If we imagine  <em>ideologies</em> (i.e.
systems of representation, regimes of signs) as so many positioned
vectors fixed at a common origin, but not necessarily orthogonal, then
we may conceive of  <em>Ideology</em> as a (hyper-)space defined by all
these vectors.  An utterance considered under its metaphysical mode is
simply a rotation from these vectors, but within the vector space; i.e.
a vector sum of multiples of some number of existing vectors.  Our
purported Alison Brown would picture a demogenic self as speaking from
an origin other than that common to the  <em>ideology</em> vectors; and
exercising a force which resolves the  <em>ideology</em> vector origin to a
new point in an absolute coordinate system.  A terrorist act is one
sharing the  <em>ideology</em> vector origin, but pointing in a direction
orthogonal to all ideology vectors.  Such a vector is hence Kant's
 <em>noumena</em>, as I have said.  However, since any particular speech
act is a combination of its component (hence orthogonal) metaphysical
and terrorist vectors, the total vector of a speech act lies outside the
given vector space (Ideology), but nonetheless has a projection into it
(the metaphysical vector).  I imagine the effect of a speech act as
expanding, reshaping, and resolving the vector space to include the
combined speech vector which will leave the terrorist vector
outside of the vector space, but no longer orthogonal to all vectors in
the space (it will have a projection, not only onto the combined speech
vector now included in the space, but also any metaphysical vector which
has the most recent combined vector as an element to resolve).  The
continual resolution and expansion of the Ideology vector space allows
me to capture the notion of co-optation.  A terrorist vector is
completely free of co-optation only at the very moment of its
enunciation, but nonetheless does not, at least for a time, become
merely another  <em>ideology</em> vector.<p>

A second objection is more serious.  Namely, distinguishing terrorist
and metaphysical modes of talking like praising <em>terrorism,</em>
as the word is commonly used gives no ground for substantive
political choices.  The fascists may be terrorists, just as much as we
may.  But then, this is exactly the point:  insofar as we speak in the
metaphysical mode we do not act in a substantive political manner we
merely rearrange and permute dead ideologies, dead metaphors, dead
regimes.  If I act differently from fascists (and I do not know if I do)
it is not because I can name the differences, but contrarily simply
because the acts <em>are different</em>.  In fact, I am trying, not so
subtly, to exemplify the very terrorist action I praise, in the realm of
theory, by naming my opposite in a particular way:  'fascist'.
<em>Theory</em> cannot make the <em>ethical</em> distinction between
fascism and radicalism; only <em>I</em> can (only an existing, living,
radically inconsistent actor can, not an ideological, theoretical
position).  The same applies to the claims I <em>came on with</em> in
these remarks.  Materialism, as a metaphysical position, is incoherent
and quite indefensible; but I am a materialist as a political
conviction.  Metaphysically, it is foolish and naive to think that
history is the history of class struggle (as Marx always knew), but I
choose to identify myself with the interests of the proletariat against
the bourgeoisie <em> and to identify the proletariat as THE AGENT OF
REVOLUTION </em> as a <em>political</em> choice.<p>
