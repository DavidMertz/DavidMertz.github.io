<H1>Whither Romantic Love<BR><FONT SIZE=3>David

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Richard White, in an APA
conference paper on which I had the opportunity to comment,
discusses, "The Future of Romantic Love" (1995). White's point
in this paper is that romantic love presents a false alternative to
the normatively autonomous subject of our post-Kantian societies.
Romantic love, White believes, quite contrary to its pretense of
erasing the boundaries of subjects is actually one of the puzzle
pieces in the construction of this same post-Kantian subjectivity.
This much seems true enough.</P>
<P>When
one thinks a bit about just what romantic love does in support of an
overtly contrary autonomous subject, I think one reaches a few points
where White does not really specify an answer; at least not in the
mentioned paper. In particular, at least two rather different
paradigms for understanding the joint social function of overt
contraries come to my mind. Readers will, no doubt, think of some
more beyond these two.</P>
<P>One
sort of support for autonomous subjectivity which romantic love might
provide is as a sort of "release valve" for the excessive
pressure in the demands of subjectivity. White makes several remarks
that come close to this kind of metaphor for the relation of
subjectivity and romantic love. Under this metaphor, and keeping in
mind White's insistence on an historical conditioning, one might
then place romantic love as another element within a parallel series
of "disciplinary techniques" such as prisons and hospitals, which
Foucault, for example, examines. One might here imagine that each
twist and turn of historically and politically determined normative
subjectivity produces both its inherent resistances and a set of
techniques for controlling those resistances. Romantic love might
then be one technique for the diffusion of anti-autonomous rebellion
against bourgeois subjectivity.</P>
<P>The
thing to notice in the above account is that it places both a
temporal and causal priority on subjectivity over romantic love.
Subjectivity is the hot political topic and the contested terrain,
while romantic love is merely one ideological weapon used in the
campaign. Another story one might tell, which seems equally hinted at
by White, is a more structuralist tale, in which romantic abandon
becomes the very symbolic flip-side of subjective autonomy. In this
story, subjectivity and romantic love are both coeval and co-causal.
In one variation of the story, romantic love belongs to a Saussurian
chain of oppositions for autonomous subjectivity, so that the meaning
itself of subjectivity depends on its opposite marker, romantic love.
This variation demands neither that there are not also other
important defining opposites for romantic love, nor that either
subjectivity or romantic love do not participate in social mechanisms
beyond semantics. But the Saussurian version of the structuralist
tale of romance and subjects certainly demands a rather closer
linking of the two than one could allow in the Foucauldian
description of romantic love as a disciplinary technique. In the
Saussurian narrative, one can neither wrest the monological
centrality of subjectivity nor the loose teleology that the
Foucauldian mechanism might allow.</P>
<P>There
is, it seems to me, another possible variation on our structuralist
tale. Rather than as an indifferent opposition, romantic love might
function as a sort of "dark side" or "necessary repression"
for the emergence of a particular type of bourgeois subjectivity.
Whether one finds convenient a metaphor of Jekyll and Hyde, or one of
a Freudian ego emergent from the conflict of id with superego, one
could tell a certain structuralist story in which what made up
bourgeois subjectivity was neither pure autonomy nor romantic
abandon, but rather the overtly unworkable conjoining of the two.</P>
<P>I am
not much committed to any of these stories in particular. No doubt it
should be possible to give additional accounts of the way romantic
love and autonomous subjectivity relate. I think my concern is that I
cannot really become convinced of the necessary sublation, or
forgetting, or overthrow, of romantic love until I have a bit more
specific theory of how romantic love relates to bourgeois
subjectivity in the first place than White has really given us. I
quite heartily endorse his observation that the two really support
each other. I agree that romantic notions of "abandonment of self
in a beloved" are facile at best, and more likely a socially
significant ruse. But more needs to be said here.</P>
<P>Several
things raise my suspicion about White's account, and prompt me to
ask for a more specific theorization. First, and perhaps foremost of
these is the seemingly Panglossian sentiment White espouses regarding
romantic love's successor(s). Let us grant some not uncommon wisdom
that modernist subjectivity is on the outs; and grant further that
whither goes subjectivity thither romantic love. We are assured at
several points that "the decline of romantic love must inevitably
open up the space for new and more authentic forms of relationship
and the like." But why on earth should this be the case? Why not
assume, quite the contrary, that, with the dissolution of bourgeois
ideologies of autonomy, yet more inauthentic forms of human
relationship will replace or succeed romantic love? Perhaps White and
I are merely temperamentally differently inclined, but I have no
trouble envisioning a world in which the primary basis for adult
affective relations becomes an economic necessity for pooled wages.
As much of the infrastructural reality of (heterosexual) romantic
love has rested on economic battles over a male family wage earner
(and female domesticity), much of it might rest, in the future, on
the inadequacy of falling wages to support this model. Such (not so)
hypothetical relations might certainly involve focused affection and
concern, as White requires of love. I would certainly maintain that
this new type of "love" would be different from a past romantic
love, but it is not clear what might make it thereby "more
authentic."</P>
<P>To be
clear: I do not wish to suggest that a wage-driven model of
"postmodern" love is the only possible one. There might well be
others to replace romantic love, which are genuinely more authentic,
rewarding, and liberatory. But even given the correctness of
critiques of romantic love, a diagnosis of the downfall of one form
of oppression hardly in itself clears the path to a liberated future.
Bad sometimes goes to worse, and only sometimes to better.</P>
<P>Another
suspicion: White seems at points to not take his historicist and
structuralist admonitions seriously. If romantic love's "conceptual
analysis" really is "inseparable from [its] historical genealogy"
then we really cannot hope to define romantic love in either
phenomenological or psychological terms. Certainly, a strict
historicism hardly prohibits phenomenological or psychological
conjoins with romantic love as a social process. But it seems a bit
off the mark to go on a definitional search for romantic love in
epiphenomenal mental realms. At a sort of micro level, a passing
remark by White seems well to illustrate this difference. He says,
"when I say that I love my country or that I love my new car, it's
not clear that my state of mind is directly analogous to the passion
that I might feel for another person." Perhaps not. But if not,
this is a question just of psychological statistics. 
</P>
<P>What
if I do happen to feel identically towards my car as toward my lover?
The pathological nature of such a feeling cannot, I think, be a
question of its phenomenological quality. Rather, this is not "true"
romantic love because of its failure of conformity with a normative
socio-historical construction of romantic love. That is what a
historicist perspective would tell us; and common sense would happen
to concur on this. The point here is that if a social normativity can
disqualify a phenomenologically genuine romantic love, than perhaps
what makes romantic love is not mental, but social. White mostly
agrees about this, but then does not quite pin down what romantic
love really is in socio-historical terms.</P>
<P>I
think White's early mention of Roland Barthes points in a helpful
direction. For whatever critiques can and should be made of romantic
love, my own feeling is that one is better off analyzing it more in
terms of its internal semiotic system than by way of its function in
covertly supporting bourgeois subjectivity. Lots of things support
bourgeois subjectivity at various levels. Somehow that does not seem
quite sufficient to really get at the quiddity of romantic love. What
I would find preferable--no doubt after an acknowledgement of the
ideological apparatus of romantic love--would be something more
about the particular internal organization of romantic love.
Certainly we all fall-in-love, and organize this experience, in
remarkably similar ways, as White observes (following Barthes). But
just what is the logic and structure of these ways of
falling-in-love? What does this semiotic resemble? For example, are
the various oppositions and structures which stereotype romantic love
more like a language, like etiquette conventions, or like traffic
signals, to name but a few other semiotic systems?</P>
<P>One
consequence, I think, of asking about romantic love as a semiotic
system is a possible separation of its synchronic and diachronic
dimensions, although White eschews this. A semiotic has a history,
but it also has a distinct momentary structure. I must confess here,
that I have a guilty reason for trying to bring in a separation of
synchronic dimension of romantic love: I have my own take, partial
though it is, on a phenomenological centrality of certain "special"
moments in the constitution of subjectivity. Falling-in-love can be
one such moment.</P>
<P>I
have tried elsewhere to take a certain inspiration from Walter
Benjamin's division of homogeneous linear from messianic time, but
to miniaturize this distinction onto a phenomenological level. What I
have in mind is the notion that certain "saturated" moments of
experience present themselves as outside of the normal temporal
course of our lives by marking ontological changes in our being. At
certain moments we go from being one type of person to another type,
and the experience of those moments is not groundable with a causal
continuity of experience. Mind you, most such moments are perfectly
predictable, banal, and in most cases probably openly reactionary.
But they have these qualities only from the social framework outside
the transformed subject. 
</P>
<P>Consider,
as an example of saturation, the moment when we "fall-in-love"--with
all those grand particular nothings which have adhered to that moment
since the Renaissance. We remember the every appearance of our
beloved at that moment, the exact hue of the lighting, the song
playing, the very second of the time at which it happened; the love
adheres to our beloved in his every idiosyncrasy, his every
particular feature becomes the very reason we love him. From the
perspective of the symbolic/causal order, nothing in this moment is
inexplicable or special. If the light was of just such a hue that is
only because the sun was in that particular position behind the
clouds, and anyway, had it been different that difference would have
had the same personal significance. Our true love has just these
particular features, but most of these could have been predicted
perhaps years previously from our own class, family, language,
appearance, etc.--and those few not so predictable features are ones
for which we would have substituted others had they not been present.
Still, none of its causal/symbolic predictability makes our moment of
love any less personally saturated. Perhaps the light could have been
different, but it wasn't! Perhaps our beloved could have been
another, but he isn't! The saturation of that moment is visible
only from within a perspective that includes the experience of that
moment; the moment is invisible, or at least vacuous, from without.</P>
<P>My
narrative, of course, sounds like a perfectly ordinary romantic
eulogy to the splendors of love of the sort that concludes with
love's liberatory grace. That is not at all the point I would like
to make. These saturated moments so eulogized are reactionary at
best, and trite at worst. But the very phenomenological specialness
of these trite moments seems to have an importantly inevitable
position in a bourgeois/Kantian subjectivity. My feeling is that
rather than as the rather accidental "escape valve" of
subjectivity, exceptional moments like those of falling-in-love are
the rather necessary abscesses in the transcendental unity of
apperception.</P>
<P>I am
all with White in hoping for an end of romantic love, and in
agreement that this end has something to do with an end of modernity.
But I think that the change in subjectivity intertwined with these
ends is greater than that White probably thinks. It is not just a
matter of postmodern lovers valuating autonomy differently. It is
likely a matter of the next subjects constituting the world in other
than a Kantian causal order!</P>
