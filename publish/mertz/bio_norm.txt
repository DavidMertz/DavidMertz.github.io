GENOTYPE, PHENOTYPE, AND NORMS OF REACTION

  My previous comment:

    "... and will lead, soner or later, if not to _the_ causes of
    English-speaking, then at the very least to some biological markers
    which correlate with English-speaking." (nuff said?)

  A response:

    Not really. Help a stupid interactionist understand the logic of your
    argument. You're not claiming that my point is merely a tautology,
    are you? The sentence might be empirically problematic, coz we cannot
    be absolutely sure that there are any biological causes or correlates
    with English-speaking. I don't think the same could be said of
    homosex (and you'd disagree naturally :).

  Well... it's like this:  English-speaking is *entirely* environmental.
  Beyond a few people with dreadful genetic deformities (causing brain
  damage, or whatever), *anyone* can learn English.  Same goes for any
  language, obviously.  English is even a particularly good example of a
  language that won't even have any accidental widespread correlations
  with anything genetic.  It might be for Finnish or Khoi-San that the
  relatively isolated groups which speak them also have some
  genetic characteristic which is non-causally correlated with speaking
  that language.  But there are native English speakers (to say nothing
  of non-native) from India, and Hong Kong, and Europe, and Native
  Americans, and Africans/African-Americans.  There are just so many
  different groups (in terms of breeding communities) which maybe had
  been isolated for a thousand years, but in the last couple hundred
  have started speaking English, that there certainly isn't any even
  accidental correlation between *anything* genetic and English-
  speaking.

  In a general way, I tend to be an "interactionist" as well.  But it
  must be recognized that *some* things are entirely genetic, or
  entirely environmental.  I *suspect* sexual orientation isn't either
  of these, but if it turns out to be entirely environmental, then your
  language is no good.

  I think it's like this:

      Entirely Environmental    Interactional      Entirely Genetic
      ----------------------    -------------      ----------------
        Language                 Height              Blood type
        Religion                 Weight              Eye color
        etc.                     Skin color          etc.
                                 Sexuality (??)
                                 "IQ"

  I DO NOT think of these columns as a continuum, however.  I think
  they're just three seperate things.  The reason is that people usually
  make a mistake of thinking the "genetic-ness" of something determines
  the range of phenotypic possibilities.  It does, of course, in a
  sense... but not at all in the way most people think.  The usual
  conception is something like this (using sexuality as a hypothetical,
  and that old canard about "domineering mother" as the environmental
  part [mind you, this is a joke for me, it's just so stupid that it's
  funny to use]).

      #----- POPULAR CONCEPTION OF GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE INTERACTION: -----#

       Kinsey Scale:
      <--6----------5----------4----------3----------2----------1----------0-->
          ^ (Genotype A) ^                                 ^ (Genotype B) ^
          |              |                                 |              |
       Domin <-------> Passive                          Domin <-------> Passive
        mom             mom                               mom             mom


  You see what I mean.  The conception is that each genotype gives a
  certain range possible phenotypic expression.  In the popular
  conception, something which is "more genetic" gives a narrower range,
  while something which is "less genetic (more environmental)" gives a
  wider range of phenotypic possibilities.

  A more general, and more accurate picture would look like the below.
  The example I give is an extreme one to highlight the difference with
  the popular model... but the idea is that ANY curves are possible for
  some trait across some range of genotypes.  In fact, almost any curves
  CAN be found for various things (like height of corns in different
  altitudes, or whatnot):

  You see the idea.  If genotypes were like this in terms of "norm of
  sexuality" it would be impossible to say one genotype was more or less
  homosexual than another, since each would be "more homosexual" in some
  environments, but less in others.  I draw more or less linear
  functions for each genotype, but any other curve could hypothetically
  be there also.  One curve which is quite common in actual organisms is
  a normal-type curve, where a phenotype is maximized (or minimized) at
  a particular environment, but slopes off in both directions from than
  maximum (minimum).  Of course, some genotypes across some
  environmental variables have more than one maxima/minima.

  One important thing to notice is that even where different genotypes, or
  genotypic groups, each have a bell-curve in distribution, each genotype may
  reach maximal values higher than the other genotype has in the same
  environment -- while both showing the same general pattern of being
  maximized at an intermediate environment.  For example, maybe there are
  different educational styles (i.e.  rote-learning vs.  problem-solving),
  where everyone does the best with a combination of the two.  But perhaps
  different genotypic groups do better at a different point in the middle.
  If you have a socially dominant style of eduction, it could produce as an
  "artifact" the effect of giving one genotype higher average scores.
  However, if the socially dominant education style were to change slightly,
  it might favor the other group.  The picture might look like:
