<p><strong>Notes on Three Economies: Hyper-real, Real and Hidden</strong>

<p>by David Mertz

<p>&lt;approx. 5000 words&gt;</p>

<p> <strong>Thesis</strong>.  There are three structurally different,
but always interlocked, economies of visibility within late Capitalism
(possibly elsewhere):  The hyper-real, the real, and the hidden.  I want
to start with a very preliminary and tentative sketch of my distinction.
I will follow this with a few preliminary correctives to my initially
simplifying language.  During the discussion, after I talk for a bit, I
would be enormously interested in comments on all the myriad areas I've
missed in my complexifying correctives.  So first, the simplest
story.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The hyper-real</strong> is the economy of status and the
    spectacle.  Hyper-real commodities gain a value, not on their
    use-value, but rather on their power to signify a social-status that
    is itself meaningless apart from its embodiment in these
    commodities.  In an old case, art as social signifier is sold for
    amounts unrelated to any objective measure of labor-input, and
    according to an economy of class-marking.  Brand-names extend this
    process hugely such as to make the "use-value" itself of a commodity
    its ability to signify its own process/context of manufacture.
    T-Shirt and handbag logos of popular products have a status
    completely divorced from the product which they <em>simulate</em>;
    even on products <em>used</em> for identifiable purposes, what is
    sold is the brand-label which just happens to need a product on
    which to stick.  An incommensurability exists between different
    products of the same apparent category, as no rational-choice
    substitution is possible between them (i.e., "Air-Jordons" are not
    better or worse as <em>shoes</em> than other brands, since their
    function is not to cover feet, but to signify their own label).  The
    exchange of these commodities not only depends upon a visibility in
    the marketplace, their very value <em>is</em> this visibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is required in hyper-real commodities is a wild divorce from
"socially necessary average labor time" (hereafter, SNALT) of
production, as in a painting which can fluctuate overnight in "value" by
multiple orders of magnitude.  Another example of hyper-real commodities
is stock-options, and to a lesser (though significant) extent, stocks
and securities.  Most stocks tend toward a prevailing Price/Earnings
rate -- historically situated, of course.  What fluctuates the value of
an <em>option</em>, on the other hand, is not just concrete reported
changes in quantifiable things like P/E, Debt/Equity, but also is
information, rumor, and hearsay:  the very stuff of the hyper-real
economy.

<p>Still another example is that of antiques and "collectibles" -- which
<em>objectively</em> are nothing more than the cheap mass-produced items
of a bygone day, but which <em>function</em> so as to mark an imagined
status for their possessor.

<ul><li><strong>The real</strong> is the classical commodities of
    Marxist or neoclassical analysis.  These products are consumed
    because of a use-value preexisting their manufacture which they can
    fulfil.  The value/price of these commodities is determined by the
    usual considerations of manufacture costs according to the most
    efficient existing technological methods -- plus fluctuations due to
    competitive considerations of overproduction and scarcity.  However,
    a base-line price is determined by an objective <em>value</em>
    (i.e., labor time embodied in all inputs = SNALT); modulations from
    this price are more-or-less "accidental."  The exchange of these
    commodities depends upon their visibility in the marketplace; I.e.,
    they must be known to be purchasable commodities in order to
    function economically.  However, the market visibility of
    <em>real</em> commodities, contra that of the hyper-real ones,
    exists merely to represent an underlying use-value that is not
    inherently connected to their visibility in the exchange
    process.</li>

    <li><strong>The hidden</strong> is the economy of information and
    other products that are "too easily" reproduced.  Production
    techniques themselves have production costs:  in basic research,
    engineering, prototyping, Taylorist micromanagement of production,
    and other "information" costs.  However, such techniques may be
    <em>reproduced</em> much more cheaply than they may be produced.  A
    piece of software, in the extreme case, may take many thousands of
    person-hours to produce (and in cases a similarly large materials
    input -- as where software represents a physical process that must
    be tested), but may be <em>re</em>produced in five-minutes with
    $0.50 of raw materials.  There is a continuum here between products
    that are merely <em>slightly</em> cheaper to (re)produce than
    prototype to those with gaps of five or six orders of magnitude (or
    more!).  The basic distinction between production and reproduction
    costs, however, always marks a certain hidden economy.  In a sense,
    this type of commodity is "knowledge" -- but it is not necessarily
    freely and instantly communicable, as is our stereotype of
    knowledge.  </li>
</ul>

<p>In another example, it may take $X to perform an initial Taylorist analysis of a given
plant's process, and $X/2 to repeat the analysis in a second plant in the same industry.  It
is not possible simply to <em>communicate</em> abstractly what was discovered by the analysis of the
first plant, but nonetheless, a significant gap exists between production and reproduction
costs.  This is to be contrasted with the "real" economy where one widget costs the exact
same amount to produce as the next (absent a contribution from the "hidden" economy --
i.e. absent technological change).  Within competitive-capitalism "hidden" commodities
<em>must not</em> be visible in the marketplace, or else no competitive advantage is attached to them
-- in fact, their visibility would amount to an unreimbursed capital transfer to competitors.
The inputs of hidden commodities, however, themselves generally belong to the real
economy (as in technicians' salaries), or even to the hyper-real economy (as in Ivy-League
education).

<p>As hence indicated, the essential mark of "hidden" commodities is the restriction of their
circulation.  The principle of this economy insists that "hidden" goods be purchasable, but
that they be <em>finitely</em> rather than <em>indefinitely</em> purchasable.  The hidden is a class of
commodities which are produced specifically in order <em>not to be reproduced</em>.  The kind of
commodities whose nature brings them into this sphere and manner of circulation is
knowledge-commodities; other commodities may also sometimes fall within this tendency
-- as, perhaps, with commissioned artworks (to be opposed to generally circulated
artworks, though the tendencies intertwine).

<p><strong>Initial Criticisms</strong> (thanks go to Karen G.):</p>

<ul><li><strong>Q:</strong> Aren't real and hyper-real already really
    the same because of the social determination of necessary
    consumption, purchasing preferences, and
    technology/means-of-production?  That is, are not supply and demand
    already <em>social</em> facts, rather than
    <em>natural-objective</em> ones?<br><br></li>

    <li><strong>A:</strong> I don't really suppose that my three
    economies are the economies of three <em>separate</em> sets of
    commodities, but rather three <em>tendencies</em> (potentially)
    within every commodity.  Of course, I <em>do</em> think that a given
    commodity might be <em>almost</em> entirely subsumed under just one
    of the tendencies.  The tendential talk is a little bit of a dodge,
    but I'll try to explain it in more detail in later sections.

    <p>Supply and demand <em>do</em> already play into a hyper- real
    economy to a certain extent.  But I think it is clear that SNALT
    really is at issue in some commodities.  The whole "status" issue
    becomes a non-issue at any but a retail level:  nobody's going to
    pay for the status of a certain brand of raw iron or corn (or at
    least not very much).  Some retail products are like this too.  The
    Ricardo/Marx point is that there is a <em>tendency</em> for price to
    converge to SNALT (you know, "falling rate-of-profit" and all
    that).<br><br></li>

    <li><strong>Q:</strong> Couldn't it be shown that the
    <em>inflation</em> of certain prices above the level of
    SNALT-of-production is merely a reflection of the dictates of
    marketing and advertisement, which involves large capital outlays,
    which must be made up for in pricing structure?  For example,
    perhaps the extra cost of "Air Jordans" is simply a result of the
    extra marketing spent on them.<br><br></li>

    <li><strong>A:</strong> If the rate-of-profit of "Air Jordans" is
    not substantially higher than that of Brand X, then they shouldn't
    be included in the hyper-real (at least at a preliminary analysis).
    I don't know these particular details, but in "production costs" I
    would INCLUDE the costs of marketing/advertising.  Certainly
    marketing may well play a crucial role in the hyper-real economy,
    but if its role is simply a:

    <p align="center">Production + Profit + Func(Marketing) = Cost</p>

    <p>type relation, then this has nothing to do with the hyper-real.
    In the hyper-real it would be required that giving "Air Jordans'"
    advertising budget to Brand X not have any <em>functional</em>
    (i.e., linear multiplicative) relation to price or profit.  The
    hyper-real is where price/profit become socially divorced from
    (inclusive) production costs.  This is why the fine arts are such a
    good example:  <em>NO</em> amount of paid publicity can make a
    Lichtenstein into a Van Gogh; there is a whole separate economy of
    "tastes" and "fashion."
</ul>

<p><strong>Genealogies.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>The hyper-real</strong> is the economy in my picture
    with the most interesting and variegated theoretical history -- or
    at least it's the tradition that some of you might not be entirely
    familiar with.  I suppose it should be confessed that the "real"
    economy itself has quite an interesting and scandalous history of
    theoretical construction, going from the Physiocrats, through Smith
    and Ricardo, to the Classical economists, taking a detour with Marx,
    being restored to its ahistorical purity by the Neo-Classicals,
    being deconstructed by Sraffa, and restored to its pristine
    positivism by Econometrics.  However, this story is painfully
    familiar to most everyone in this room, so I shan't repeat it.  What
    I'd like to mention briefly instead is the history some of you may
    not recognize of the theoretical genealogy of my notion of a
    hyper-real economy.  I was originally hoping to talk in length about
    some of the figures I'll mention, but I have so many remarks about
    the theoretical picture that I'm going drastically to abbreviate my
    summary of my predecessors.  If anyone wants to discuss any of these
    people further, I'd be happy to do so in discussion.</li>

    <ul><li>Marcel <strong>Mauss</strong>, in <em>The Gift</em>, in
        conscious opposition to Neo-classical economics, attempted to
        identify a pattern of what he called "symbolic exchange" in a
        variety of societies.  In the "primitive" societies he looked
        at, certain exchanges took the form of <em>potlatch</em> -- or,
        in other words, gifts given symbolically to others that
        simultaneously incur a symbolic debt to the giver, and which
        raise the giver's symbolic <em>status</em> within the community.
        Claude <strong>Levi-Strauss</strong> borrows much from Mauss'
        picture of symbolic exchange, most particularly in his analysis
        of the "exchange of women" which Levi-Strauss understands quite
        closely on the model of inculcation of symbolic debt.</li>

        <li>Georges <strong>Bataille</strong> is probably my favorite of
        all my predecessors in analyzing the hyper-real.  Bataille picks
        up the notion of symbolic exchange from Mauss, then tries to
        universalize it spectacularly to cover not just the fundamental
        economics of every society, but the basic principles of
        biological life, and of consciousness.  In his book, <em>The
        Accursed Share</em>, Bataille proposes what he calls a "General
        Economy" to be opposed to the "restricted economy" of the
        economists.  The central feature of General Economy that
        Bataille alleges economists have overlooked is the portion of
        every economic system that necessarily cannot be consumed
        productively.  Seen from the perspective of General Economy, the
        problem that all societies face is not one of management of
        scarcity, but rather the exact opposite:  the expenditure of the
        excess of the productive economy.  I think Bataille would claim
        that the status consumption within the hyper-real economy of
        late-Capitalism is nothing more than one historically situated
        technique, amongst many, for the utilization of inherently
        <em>unusable</em> products.</li>

        <li>Thorstein <strong>Veblen</strong>'s <em>Theory of the
        Leisure Class</em> was probably the first book to bring home
        Mauss' analysis of symbolic exchange, and hold that analysis as
        a mirror to Western societies.  With the anthropologists, Mauss
        and Levi-Strauss, symbolic exchange was still a tool for
        understanding the <em>savages</em>, with only an implicit nod to
        the fact that we are amongst them; and while Bataille's General
        Economy produces as a result the inadequacy of the <em>real</em>
        economy to understanding the West, the analysis is not specific
        to late-Capitalism (and, at any rate, Bataille's fully developed
        version of his theory comes later than Veblen).  What Veblen did
        was to analyze leisure-time and consumption in terms of their
        social function in marking status.  In particular, he saw
        leisure-time not simply as time away from economic activity, but
        as time meant specifically to <em>mark</em> that one had the
        freedom not to be at work -- and hence leisure must be
        <em>conspicuous</em>, as must other status-marking
        consumption.</li>

        <li>The <strong>Situationists</strong>, chiefly Guy
        <strong>Debord</strong>, attempted a critique of late Capitalism
        which went beyond the productive economic categories of Marx.
        They believed that much of the repressive mechanism of the
        <em>Society of the Spectacle</em> (Debord's book title) fell on
        the side of consumption.  In similarity with Veblen, the
        Situationists saw a cycle of consumption which served, not to
        fulfill any primarily economic needs, but to indicate class
        position.  The Situationists upped the ante, however, by casting
        class-marked consumption as a major mechanism for the
        maintenance of class relations.</li>

        <li>Jean <strong>Baudrillard</strong>, in two books from either
        side of 1970, <em>For a Critique of the Political Economy of the
        Sign</em> and <em>The Mirror of Production</em>, effected a
        synthesis of all the aforementioned authors to produce a theory
        of what I -- and he -- call the hyper-real economy.
        Baudrillard, as many of you will know, subsequently did some
        very different work that, with various merits, disallowed
        anything "real" to exist behind the hyper-real; but it is not
        the post 1972 work which is of interest to me in this analysis.
        Depending on the exact stage in the development of his theory,
        Baudrillard develops in contrast to the "real" economy either a)
        a conflicting tendency toward a "status" economy; or b) a set of
        commodities which fall outside the SNALT economy.  If my notion
        of a hyper-real economy appeals to you, Baudrillard, in the
        works I mention, is the place to turn -- although I think my
        analysis is non-identical with his.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>The real</strong>:  I think the real economy will be
    quite familiar enough to a group of people who analyze it for a
    living that I need not explore its genealogy.  I might mention,
    however, that the term might well remind one both of an ironic use
    both of Lacan's "Real" and the old state-socialist division of
    "real" productivity from <em>mere</em> service-provision.</li>

    <li><strong>The hidden</strong>:  As far as I know, the "hidden" is
    my own.  Economists have always been interested in the productive
    activity underlying technical change; and they've hardly been
    unaware of protections like patents, nor of the violations of
    secrets in industrial espionage.  But I know of no one who places
    the specific production of the means of technical change, and of the
    "too easily reproducible" generally, within the specific context of
    differing economies of visibility.  If anyone can point me to
    example of predecessors to my analysis, I would welcome the
    information.  Unfortunately, I think I'll hence wind up giving the
    "hidden" economy somewhat short shrift in this paper, even though I
    wish it to be considered fully on the level of the real and
    hyper-real, and not a mere addendum.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Base and Superstructure</strong> is an orthogonal division to
the division of three economies I suggest; each "economy," in the sense
I speak of the three, has its own superstructural and "economic" (in the
sense of opposition to superstructure) formations.  My hypothesis on how
to understand base and superstructure vis-a-vis my own tripartite
division will have to be particularly sketchy, within an already sketchy
idea I'm trying to explore.  The main point to understand, though, is
that although I <em>do</em> believe, in a certain way, in the
distinction between base and superstructure, it's a different kind of
distinction than that I'm getting at in these remarks.</p>

<ul><li>For example, in one of the initial objections I mentioned, my
    imagined conversant (who is, in reality, Karen G.) hinted to the
    fact that <em>necessary</em> consumption, whether necessary for the
    reproduction of persons or of productive processes, is a
    <em>social</em> rather than a <em>natural</em> necessity.  This I
    admit -- or rather, beyond admitting this, I'm quite adamant about
    it.  Marx himself already somewhere remarks on the social necessity
    of millet to the English working class, versus rice to the Chinese
    -- or something to this effect.  Without wanting to speak too
    broadly of actual national food preferences, I'd like to run with
    this example for a bit.  Marx's kind of social facts -- such as what
    is necessary for the reproduction of a given working class -- is
    probably properly considered a <em>superstructural</em> fact insofar
    as it's somehow <em>extrinsic</em> to the productive process the
    workers engage in.  I don't mean to be too hard and fast with this
    distinction; I don't believe, for example, that a factory could
    always be transported from England to China while functioning
    unchanged.  But there is a certain independence of these things, and
    there is an extent to which it's not an English worker <em>qua</em>
    worker, but rather an English worker <em>qua</em> Englishman or
    Englishwoman, who requires millet for sustenance.</li>

    <li>Still, an English worker's need for millet is not hyper-real.
    Millet is not consumed by an English worker as a specific marker of
    <em>status</em> -- or, more accurately, millet may be consumed as a
    marker of <em>extrinsic</em> status, but it is not consumed as a
    marker of <em>intrinsic</em> status.  Let me explain my use of
    intrinsic and extrinsic, which are certainly not transparent.
    Millet marks a certain kind of status, namely the status of being
    English rather than Chinese.  I'd like to call this kind of status
    "extrinsic" both insofar as it marks a difference between external
    large groups, such as nations, and also insofar it is more of a
    background assumption than a deliberative bit of status negotiation
    (Erving Goffman would call it <em>facework</em> -- but I don't wish
    herein to attempt to explain Goffman along with everything else).
    <em>Intrinsic</em> status, on the other hand, is something one
    <em>personally</em> negotiates in one's actions and purchases; it is
    the more-or-less conscious choices of distinction which juxtaposes
    one with the people one daily encounters:  friends, coworkers,
    neighbors, bosses, even family.  It is the markers of
    <em>intrinsic</em> status which fall under the tendency of the
    hyper-real economy.  Again, caution is warranted here.  I don't
    suppose that extrinsic/intrinsic form an absolute line across which
    nothing may cross -- for example, many an English worker may proudly
    devour millet in conscious and deliberate contrast with her
    rice-eating Chinese friend and coworker -- but I think the pair
    represents real poles between which particular status-markers are
    arranged.</li>

    <li>Now that I've indicated features of base and superstructure
    within what's essentially the "real" economy, I'd like at least to
    hint that the base/superstructure pair is simultaneously present
    within hyper-real and hidden economies.  </li>

    <ul><li>Within the "hidden" economy, features of base and
        superstructure are readily apparent.  As I've said, the hidden
        economy is that concerned with commodities whose production cost
        dramatically exceeds their reproduction cost -- particularly
        informational commodities.  The base of this economic tendency
        or realm is quite simply the lack of reproductive circulation of
        the commodity; the superstructural support for this limitation
        of circulation is all the legal and cultural forms which
        implement and enforce this circulatory limitation.  For example,
        in modern Capitalism, the superstructural mechanism of
        enforcement of the hidden economy is all the laws concerning
        intellectual property:  patents, trademarks, copyrights,
        fair-use rules, security classification of knowledges, and the
        like.  In other societies this takes other forms; for example,
        in feudal Europe the guild apprenticeship system prevented ready
        transferability of acquired skills between competing
        guilds.</li>

        <li>The features of base and superstructure may prove a bit more
        difficult to discern with the hyper-real economy.  While all
        economic facts are inherently cultural facts, in one sense, the
        status economy of the hyper-real participates in culture in that
        special sense which opposes culture to "economics" -- as
        superstructure is opposed to base, even while both base and
        superstructure are already really superstructural facts.  I
        think the hint of a base/superstructure opposition may exist
        even within the hyper-real economy, however, insofar as the
        intrinsic versus extrinsic status which marked the difference
        between the hyper-real and the real is, in fact, <em>repeated
        within</em> the hyper-real.  Some status markers which are
        intrinsic in the sense of placing them within the hyper-real
        domain may indicate an extrinsicly hyper-real status, while
        others indicate a doubly intrinsic status.  To put this in what
        may be more intelligible form:  some commodities which are
        intra-cultural markers mark a status independent of the
        commodity itself, while others mark a status in no way separable
        from the commodity.  For example, sports cars and expensive
        artwork both function chiefly to mark a cultural status -- a
        <em>class</em> status, basically -- and this marker is only
        available to those who really belong to the class indicated,
        because the price itself excludes other classes.  These
        commodities we might well describe as the <em>base</em> of the
        hyper-real economy.  Other commodities form an intermediate
        status, they still serve to mark a pre-existing class status (or
        status of gender, race, etc), but their inherent commodity-form
        does not exclude other classes.  For example, readership of
        <strong>Forbes</strong> magazine marks bourgeois class status,
        but the magazine cover price does not inherently exclude other
        readers, and the distribution channels do so only very weakly.
        Still other commodities, which we would call entirely
        superstructural within the hyper-real, mark no pre-existing
        status outside themselves, but rather create a doubly intrinsic
        status.  As an example, paraphernalia naming different
        entertainers who essentially appeal to the same demographics may
        nonetheless mark internally meaningful status differentiations
        (i.e. hip-hop vs. heavy-metal).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consumption and Production</strong>, as a well known economic
distinction might easily be confused with the typology I suggest.  A
first reading -- and a reading suggested by the hyper-real's roots in
the Situationists, and in parts of Baudrillard -- could conflate the
hyper-real with the realm of consumption, while assuming the real
occupies the lonely place of production.  Insofar as consumption nearly
always has a hyper-real tendency within it which has been generally
unrecognized by economists, this reading is well motivated.  But it's
nonetheless wrong.</p>

<ul><li>All three of my economies have their primary focus on the
    consumptive side of the commodity equation.  I don't think
    production and consumption can properly be separated, mind you,
    being altogether too intimately connected for this -- but the
    <em>focus</em> of my analysis is consumptive.  My point is that
    there are these structurally different manners in which things can
    be consumed.  The fact that the price/SNALT ratio is somewhat
    correlated with this categorization is not really the central
    feature I'm interested in, although it's probably the most obvious
    indicator.  I will admit, further, that much on the production side
    of things is geared towards promoting appropriation in a particular
    consumptive mode -- to wit, advertising.  The overall trend of
    American advertising seems to be to try to move products into
    appropriation in a hyper-real mode, and hence allow for a degree of
    profit disproportionate with PRoP. But where this advertising fails,
    or where it's never attempted, there's still a mode of consumption
    associated with the "real" economy:  namely, consumption according
    to the dictates of a superstructurally determined necessity of
    reproduction of worker <em>qua</em> worker, as opposed (insofar as
    such is possible) to worker <em>qua</em> bearer of status.</li>

    <li>From the PoV of my tendential analysis of three
    <em>consumptive</em> economies, production is homogenous within the
    lacunae of my scheme.  Productive consumption -- consumption <em>in
    the manufacture of commodities</em> -- may use inputs belonging to
    all of my economies, and may use these inputs according to the
    principles of all my economies.  This is perhaps most strikingly
    true in the case of labor-commodity, as will be discussed below.
    However, the consumptive economies which subsume the particular
    inputs of a particular productive process are quite independent of
    the economic principle within which a produced good may be consumed.
    That is, both Nike and K-Mart may use hyper-real, real and hidden
    inputs in the production of their shoes, but Nike's shoes will be
    consumed dominantly in a hyper-real economy, and K-Mart's dominantly
    within a real one.  For that matter, Nike might well have a
    predominance of real inputs, and K-Mart a predominance of hyper-real
    inputs, without changing the relative consumptive economies of their
    outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inclusion of the Commodity Labor</strong>.  That most central
and mysterious of commodities, labor, does not escape a trifurcation
into my three economies -- or at least a bifurcation into the first two
(the hidden may exclude this commodity).  </p>

<ul><li>The tendency for wages to fall to the level of the SNALT of
    their inputs (food, shelter, training, etc.) is really not too far
    off, despite the bad rap Marx has gotten in this regard.  This
    tendency seems to be on even firmer footing once it is admitted that
    the SNALT for the production of the labor-commodity, like the SNALT
    of all commodities, is itself a more-or-less
    <em>superstructural</em> phenomenon.  Of course, as I've suggested,
    superstructural phenomena, such as the determination of the SNALT of
    labor-commodity production, themselves fall into all the three
    tendential economies I examine.  We must hence expect
    labor-commodity to be itself produced in all three of my three
    economies.</li>

    <li>Some labor-commodity, however, seems to divorce itself from it's
    earthly SNALT determinants, and become wholly (or predominantly)
    hyper-real.  As an example, the namesake of the hyper-real 'Air
    Jordons' mentioned above, Michael Jordon, probably receives a wage
    quite unrelated to the cost of production of his skills and
    sustenance (I don't know what this wage is, but I assume it to be in
    the millions of dollars per annum).  It will probably be argued that
    this wage, in fact, reflects the <em>use-value</em> of Jordon to his
    ball-club, i.e. the increased profitability of the club brought
    about by his playing in it.  I actually don't believe this, but it
    would be difficult to demonstrate one way or another conclusively.
    At any rate, I am quite certain that there is a strong tendency
    within entertainment industries (including sports) to include
    <em>stars</em> within their employ purely as a status indicator,
    rather than from econometric calculations of profitability.  As an
    example, I'm sure everyone is familiar with entertainers in music,
    film or sports who are prevented from the desired
    production/distribution of their products, even while the owning
    interest wishes to maintain them under contract.</li>

    <li>Be that as it may about entertainers, I think the clearest
    example of a hyper-real economy of labor-commodities is within upper
    management.  The top managers of large corporations, despite their
    increasing overt indistinguishability from owners, are still
    <em>technically</em> employees of their companies.  And yet, wages
    paid to such management is objectively independent of the scarcity,
    SNALT of production, or use-value of their labor.  Upper management
    increasingly participates in the "star system" of Capital, after the
    style of the 1940's Hollywood star system of film (still continuing,
    as I say previously).  Perhaps simply to name Lee Iaccoca
    demonstrates my point.  Iaccoca's skills, such as they are, are not
    substantially different from those of a million other managers who
    perform largely the same job with largely the same education.  But
    Iaccoca's labor is not purchased by Chrysler primarily because of
    it's SNALT or its use-value, nor even because of mechanisms of
    supply and demand.  Rather, it is Iaccoca himself, his
    person/persona, who serves as a high-profile iconic signifier of the
    class-position of Chrysler as a company.  It is precisely in
    employing a well-know "star" at a multi-million dollar salary that
    Chrysler is able to <em>represent</em> itself as the kind of company
    which employs a multi-million dollar CEO.  The question here is a
    question of status and visibility, not primarily one of production
    and use-value.</li>

    <li>At the same moment, however, in our post-Modern late-capitalist
    world, consumers consume automobiles largely within a hyper-real
    economy of status -- and part of a Chrysler automobile's ability to
    represent status lies in the Chrysler corporation's ability to
    represent its own status.  Even the adjectives one might use to
    describe one's automobile purchasing decision have, in a way, "slid
    under the signifier" -- it's no longer easy to discern whether
    someone's description of a Chrysler as "solid, reliable and
    efficient" is meant as a description of the car, or of the company.
    In fact, such discerning may well be more than merely difficult, it
    may be entirely non-sensible insofar as consumers no longer
    themselves distinguish between the commodity and the status carried
    along with the name of its manufacturer.  Hyper-real salaries paid
    Iaccoca and other "star" executives probably isn't simply
    <em>irrational</em>, as certain liberal critiques would have it, but
    may in fact be the central necessity of the non-real economy within
    which automobiles are actually consumed.  It's not that one
    <em>cannot</em> ask whether Iaccoca's salary is profitable or costly
    for Chrysler -- indeed, this question probably well has a
    determinate answer -- it's rather that this question is one which
    belongs to the <em>wrong economy</em> for describing the hyper-real
    circuit of automobile production and consumption.</li>

    <li>All labor is, nonetheless, partially hyper-real -- and perhaps
    all still retains an iota of "reality."  EXPLAIN.</li>
