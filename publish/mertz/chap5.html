			<h3>Remembering Events</h3>
			<p>Lest we forget some events in a recent decade, it is
  worthwhile reminding ourselves of the furor of articles,
  arrests, prosecutions, classroom discussion, etc. about
  'Satanic Ritual Abuse' (and a few allied concepts) which
  occurred between, approximately, 1980 and 1993.  During this
  time, hundreds of people were convicted based on evidence that
  seems laughably absurd from the "outside" of the transient
  ideology of ritual abuse, thousands more were accused and
  hounded, and dozens of the convicted remain imprisoned on
  sentences ranging from tens to hundred of years.  America's
  newspapers-of-record reported and advocated these goings on
  pretty much without demur until the early 1990s.  Journals
  which should have known better<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>I think particularly of the shameful participation of
    <cite>Ms.</cite> in the witch hunt.  During its
    "academic", ad-free, incarnation, no less!</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  engaged in obsessions of taint and impurity.  Hundreds of
  millions of dollars were spent on fantastic police and
  prosecutorial investigations (mostly at local or county levels
  in a few places), and hundreds of millions more were spent on
  institutes, conferences, training materials, and the other
  academic trappings of legitimation (mostly at a federal level).
  Although the scale of this particular hysteria cannot compare
  to the vaster scope of our drug-war state, it certainly
  exceeds the scope of other famous American witch-hunts:  those
  in Salem and by HUAC.</p>
			<p>It is not my goal in this section to provide anything
  original in terms of empirical description of what I will call
  'ritual abuse ideology.'<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>For my purposes herein, let us allow the inclusion of
    several related concepts/ideologies within the general term.
    The notions of 'rape trauma syndrome', 'repressed memory
    syndrome', 'sadistic abuse' and some other pseudo-clinical
    terms are markers of a few slight variations on the themes of
    ritual abuse ideology.  The history and functioning of the
    several notions is close enough that they may easily be
    considered under a common term for my general purpose of
    determing their mode of ideological
    functioning.</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  The cat has been let out of the bag by a number of writers more
  familiar with the historical details than I am.  What I hope to
  do instead is show how the ritual abuse ideology of our recent
  past illustrates some of my concepts of totalization, hegemony,
  and the non-refutational demise of ideologies.  As far as that
  empirical description which I shall find relevant, I shall rely
  on the quite excellent text, Satan's Silence [Nathan and
  Snedeker, 1995], which although written from a journalistic and
  legal perspective, well illustrates many of the philosophical
  concepts I want to implement.  Other recent books and articles
  have covered similar ground, although none probably quite as
  thoroughly.</p>
		
		
			<h3>Forgetting Everything</h3>
			<p>The very first paragraphs of Nathan and Snedeker's book
  point towards both of the complements which I have tried to
  articulate in this dissertation:  the necessary and the
  impossible.  More narrowly, the complements (at least
  complementary in a diachronic sense) are totalization and
  amnesic non-refutation.<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>See the discussion below, at page### 232, about this
    slightly specialized term I advance.</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  Both elements in the histories of hegemonies serve to remove
  the "ideas" which make up these ideologies from the discursive
  dialectic of a Habermasian or Millean "contest of ideas."  Let
  us look at Nathan and Snedeker's remarks, which are proffered
  without any particular philosophical intent:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Writing this book has been hard for us.
    There was a time when publicly expressing skepticism about
    small children being ceremonially raped and tortured by
    organized groups was, as one journalist put it, practically
    an indictable stance.  We can testify to this:  in the late
    1980s, one of us had the police at her door, on a maliciously
    false report of child maltreatment, after publishing an
    article suggesting the innocence of a day-care teacher
    convicted of ritual abuse.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Several years later, the national mood has
    changed.  Doubting is easy now and, for many of the people we
    know especially lawyers and journalists even fashionable.
    Both of us have been lauded for our early skepticism, praised
    for helping free innocent prisoners, and asked how we were
    able to remain clearheaded when so many others
    didn't.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>For people not caught up in a hysteria, it
    is easy to demonstrate its absurdity.  What is hard is to
    appreciate its sense, to recognize how a social panic "works"
    for people people who may not be very different from the
    skeptics who deride them.  [Nathan and Snedeker, 1995,
    p.ix]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p> I fear that in certain cases I participate in a sin of
  my discipline by expressing ordinary ideas "theoretically."
  Here is a chance for a partial remedy.  Totalization and
  amnesic non-refutation, for all their neologistic sound, are
  quite ordinary phenomena of everyday lives.  Nathan and
  Snedeker stand innocent of my theoreticist sin.</p>
			<p>Totalization, in the end, is just a name for the
  historical sequences by which certain things become "unsayable"
  or at least, not sayable within the bound of "normal"
  discourse.  Saying certain things things which were quite
  ordinary a few years before, and which become quite ordinary a
  few years later becomes met with a number of mechanisms of
  social eschewal.  Such eschewal can take a number of forms.  We
  can say things only ever to be met with blank stares; or we can
  say things only to have a "principle of generosity" <b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>A certain amount of discussion of Davidson's concept
    occurs beginning on page### 255.  I believe enough is

  kick in according to which every time we say 'X' it is quickly
  interpreted as 'Y', since only the latter "makes sense;" or we
  can encounter insistent, but empty, refutations of "you
  certainly cannot mean that!"; or, where necessary, we can be
  arrested, lynched, or run out of town when we say eschewed
  things.</p>
			<p>One key to deciphering totalization is in its transience.
  Or more precisely, it is totalizing ideologies' amnesic
  non-refutation.  If it were the case that an idea held sway for
  a time, based on a bunch of evidence supporting it, but was
  given up by agreement after dispassionate discussion, I would
  not want to call the old ideas totalizing.  Even ideas which
  somewhat less than entirely met this picture, but had a lot of
  tendencies it that direction, would hardly be totalizing
  ideologies.  The picture I briefly sketch is a common
  lay-positivist one of scientific progress.  One could mention
  Popper here, but the picture is nothing so specific as that.
  But in the same approximate way that non-totalizing ideas can
  be described as Popperian, totalizing ones can be described as
  Kuhnian (or maybe Feyerabendian).  The step of positivistic
  refutation just never happens to totalizing ideologies.
  Rather, the old totalizing ideas just get old, and the
  constellations of forces which made the ideas non- refutable
  (by all the social eschewals mentioned above), just do not
  operate any longer.  I do not have a theory of why this happens
  in just the same way that Feyerabend [Feyerabend, 1975] does
  not have a theory of scientific change.  Things change for a
  chaotic assortment of reasons which operate at all levels of
  description, and all levels of social agency; one does not have
  a unified theory of anarchic regularities.</p>
			<p>Let me note here that we have a luxury with ritual abuse
  ideology, with AIDS, with the terrorist imago, even with the
  war-on-drugs frenzy, that we or I do not have with other
  ideologies I argue are totalizing throughout this dissertation
  (or social forms, for that matter, that I have to argue are
  ideological at all).  Some ideologies are short enough
  temporally that I and my readers can live through both sides of
  them.  Others we might see only the start or end of hopefully
  the end which might still give us the comparative viewpoint to
  understand what we could not from within the totalizing
  ideology.  Of still others, we might get glimpses of the
  outside from old writing by long-dead writers (or painters,
  builders, etc.).  But of still others, no reasonable outside
  exists which is substantially or concretely available to us.
  The outsides of sex, or of causality, are thousands of years
  gone, or in some indefinite distant future.  It would be nice
  to "critique" sex (or causality) sometime after its amnesic
  non-refutation, but that is not an available position from
  which I can identify sex as a totalizing ideology.</p>
			<p>The luxury provided by ritual abuse ideology is the
  luxury of homology.  All my case studies are just that.  I can
  track these histories of a few totalizing ideologies, show how
  they operated, start to finish, then bring those modes of
  operations to ideologies with larger horizons.  I cannot see
  from the outside of some larger closures, but at least I can
  see that the view from the inside looks an awful lot like the
  view from the inside of those totalizing ideologies whose
  horizons we have transcended (by historical accident, not by
  force of will).  The conclusion of this examination of homology
  is the following:  if big hegemonies are ever transcended, it
  will be in the mode of amnesic non-refutation, not in that of
  refutation.  If we get past sex or causation or subjectivity,
  it will not have been by critique.  Just like it was not by
  critique that we got past the little ideology of ritual
  abuse.</p>
		
		
			<h3>Motives, Right and Left</h3>
			<p>Like anything which can function in a totalizing manner
  nowadays, ritual abuse ideology has its special appeal to both
  the Right and the Left; and every political slant (which can be
  multiplied by more than one split, of course) feels its
  participation in the ideology as an intrinsic and organic
  outgrowth of what it really always believed all along.</p>
			<p>Ritual abuse ideology grew out of some ideological
  movements which did not function in a totalizing manner, but
  which also had a parallel appeal to both Left and Right wing
  thinking in particular, both feminists and anti-feminists had
  an interest in proto-ritual-abuse ideas.<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>As is obvious, 'Right' and 'Left' cut up a number of
    axis which are not identical.  There is a Right and a Left on
    welfare-policy, on individualism/communalism, on corporate
    vs. government autonomy, on "social issues" like sexual
    choices, on regulation of speech, on income distribution, and
    so on.  Although opinions on such ideas cluster, all kinds of
    permutations occur.  Saying feminist vs. anti- feminist is
    actually not just one such axis, but several.  And even these
    several axes do not exhaust the dualities in the appeal of
    ritual abuse ideology and its predecessors.  However, in a
    broad sense, ritual abuse ideology can be understood as
    growing out of strong pro- and con- reactions to the women's
    movement of the early 1970s.  The ideology is not reducible
    to that movement, but it cannot be understood without a
    strong sense of the connection to the women's movement (and
    to the movement's enemies).</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  A unified appeal to opposite groups for opposite reasons seems
  to be a necessary, but not a sufficient, property of ideologies
  which totalize.  The crucial proto-ideology leading up to
  ritual abuse ideology is that of father-daughter
  incest.<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>I hope it will be obvious to readers of the rest of
    this document that by describing father- daughter incest as
    an ideology, I am not dismissing a legitimate concern about
    the crime.  But the discourse of father-daughter incest in
    the late-1970's was not generically a "legitimate concern."
    Discourses ideologies have their own ways of conceptualizing
    their object, of legitimizing their inquiry, of propounding
    their viewpoint, which are not crudely reducible to an
    unreflective "legitimate concern."  Actually, such a
    reduction to "common sense" to a claimed purely
    non-ideological status is always a good marker for the
    ideological function of an idea (but not, I think, evidence
    of totalizing function).  In this, father-daughter incest was
    very clearly an ideological formation.</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  Feminists of the 1970s focussed much of their critical analysis
  on the functioning of patriarchy within family structures, on
  domestic violence, on heterosexuality as a control mechanism.
  An attention to father-daughter incest is a short step from
  these concerns.  But incest ideas would not have done as well
  had they been relatively univocal in arising from feminist
  concerns.  Instead, they simultaneously arose from distinctly
  anti-feminist sentiments.</p>
			<p>It was not just patriarchy that was to blame for
  father-daughter incest so say some of its ideologues but also
  the women's movement.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[They] saw this domestic Lolita as a
    reincarnation of the good traditional wife.  While her mother
    engaged in neurotic job and community pursuits, the daughter
    greeted her father fondly when he returned after a miserable
    day at work Under the circumstances, the poor father could
    hardly help being aroused, and there was no one around to
    save him from his lust.  His wife, after all, acted
    "remarkably oblivious" to the developing incest since it
    promised to free her from her husband's unwanted demands.
    For [the anti-feminist incest ideologues], the foundation of
    a good domestic system was a husband and a wife who got along
    well.  If they did, incest was unlikely Part of the repair
    work involved getting the mother to apologize to her
    daughter.  [Nathan and Snedeker, p.21]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>As with the following ritual abuse ideology, these
  apparently opposite approaches to conceiving incest had more
  than just a coincidental confluence.  </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[F]eminists did not back the [...] pro-family
    program simply as a compromise with moral conservatism.  On
    the contrary, many women's advocates found much to like about
    the [...] approach to incest intervention Feminists [...] were
    also excited by [...] efforts to control men's private behavior
    and, in so doing, to make them "more submissive and
    nurturant" towards their wives and children.  [Nathan and
    Snedeker, p.22]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In this strange alliance in what seems to be an
  identificatory mechanism with an unfolding ideology we start to
  see the glimpses of totalization which comes to fruition in
  ritual abuse ideology.</p>
			<p>Another predecessor ideology which contributed to ritual
  abuse ideology was the kiddie porn crusades.  Kiddie porn was a
  godsend for anti-porn feminists.  Totalitarians like Dworkin
  and MacKinnon never carried much sentiments for civil
  liberties, but,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[M]any feminists, who found pornography
    distasteful, were torn by their belief in the First Amendment
    right to produce and view it.  On the other hand, sexual
    depictions of children seemed incontrovertibly wrong But now,
    as the congressional witnesses paraded their dire statistics
    and pictures of nude children, [feminist columnist Ellen]
    Goodman felt "a sense of relief."  Now, she wrote, Americans
    could register their disapproval of pornography in a
    "refreshingly uncomplicated" way.  [Nathan and Snedeker,
    p.42]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>From the other side, an anti-feminist "family-values"
  ideology found kiddie porn a similar godsend.  Kiddie porn, to
  them, had a similar moral disambiguity in proving all that was
  wrong with "deviant" sexual practices homosexuality,
  exhibitionism, promiscuity, etc. which to them were all of a
  piece with kiddie porn.  Kiddie porn was probably the start of
  the totalizing function in this cluster, and certainly provided
  the necessary ideological tools with which to build ritual
  abuse ideology.  Although,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>At its height, kiddie porn grossed far less
    than $1 million per year (compared with billions of dollars
    for the adult industry) [T]his information was publicly
    available by 1980, but during the next few years, officials
    and much of the media continued to claim that commercial
    child pornography involved millions of children and a vast
    underground network of pedophiles engaged in a
    multibillion-dollar business.  [Nathan and Snedeker,
    p.42]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>With the intellectual and epistemic pieces in place, a
  totalizing ideology came together.</p>
		
		
			<h3>Flashpoints</h3>
			<p>Ritual abuse ideology congealed in a couple places,
  fairly rapidly.  In some ways, the "outbreaks"<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>Even though the disease metaphors of 'outbreak',
    'spread', 'infection' and so on have some connotations I do
    not want to make, overall the imagery fits the pattern of
    ritual abuse ideology too closely to disallow the metaphor.
    I do not think the ideology affects only 'infected'
    communities in a broad sense, nor that it is as
    self-contained as a virus or germ which really is in a
    distinct geographic location.  But still, the pervasiveness,
    and the concrete effects (i.e. prosecutions), have the uneven
    distribution of an infectious disease, and much the same
    pattern of spread.  The preconditions are global, but the
    outbreaks still have their identifiable "Typhoid
    Mary's."</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  were triggered by quite accidental particularities.  But given
  the elements which came together in the above discussed kiddie
  porn and incest ideologies, I think the occurrence of ritual
  abuse ideology in its manifest form of prosecutions was bound
  to occur somewhere.  Prosecutions of persons for ritual abuse
  of children have clustered in a few places, although in those
  few places as many as dozens of child-sex abuse rings have been
  "uncovered."  That is the manifest form of the ideology; the
  latent form was certainly much more widespread, and the
  ideology was generally believed in a more passive way pretty
  much throughout the USA.  </p>
			<p>As the motive cause of the first two waves of ritual
  abuse prosecutions were the delusional fantasies of two
  Southern California women suffering from severe mental
  disorders.  In 1982, Mary Ann Barbour, in Kern County, began
  making accusations of molestation against a wide range of
  people whom her daughters had been in contact with, mostly
  extended family.  Over the course of the following year or two,
  these accusations spread to include many more "abusers", and
  through a network of social-services and police agencies, many
  more "victims" as well.  In 1983, Judy Johnson, of Manhattan
  Beach, began a similar range of accusations, although this time
  specifically against day-care providers.  Again, as police,
  prosecutors and social-workers were recruited into the cause,
  dozens or hundreds of additional victims were recruited into
  the prosecution of the infamous McMartin Preschool case.
  Testimony of children children more and more peripheral to the
  original accusations was evinced over time using some of the
  techniques and "expert knowledge" described below; as more
  testimony was evinced, grander and grander conspiracies of
  Satanist sex rings was revealed (or rather, imagined).</p>
			<p>It is not particularly remarkable that a couple women
  with histories of delusional mental illness could imagine
  scenarios in which their children had been sexually abused.  To
  Barbour and Johnson, these frightful events (made ever more
  fantastic with the later invention of child-abuse
  "professionals") must have seemed terrifyingly real, as are
  many delusions of schizophrenics.  What is shocking in
  retrospect is the manner in which a variety of centers of
  professional, official knowledge were put into the service of
  legitimating and enforcing these delusions.  The police
  initially treated reverentially the none-too-subtle and
  semi-coherent rantings of accusers.  Psychologists and
  social-workers stepped into to "interview" children with the
  effective result of producing imaginary stories wilder than any
  original delusions of Barbour or Johnson.  Children who
  invented stories about the original accused, in the same
  coercive situations invented further stories about unrelated
  additional perpetrators; and these secondary accusations in
  turn led to new waves of investigations, new groups of children
  recruited to "testify," new "sex-rings" being uncovered,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The social hysteria that McMartin incited
    upped ritual-abuse cases to another level.  While at first
    they were products of delusional individuals, by 1984 whole
    social systems had been set up to justify and develop
    accusations and prosecutions.  What happened in Kern County
    is an example.  There, local officials assembled a remarkable
    apparatus for generating massive investigations and trials.
    It included sheriff's deputies, social workers, prosecutors,
    and [doctors].  [Nathan and Snedeker,
    p.93]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The irreality of the construction of "official knowledge"
  in the ritual abuse communities quickly encompassed the
  judiciary also,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[Kern County Defendants'] sentences ranged
    from 273 to 405 years in prison; the women's time shattered
    previous state records.  When a newspaper reporter asked
    Friedman [the judge in the case] why he had meted out such
    draconian punishments, he answered that it was because he had
    seen pictures of the defendants molesting the children and
    committing "every perversion imaginable."  Yet no such
    evidence had been presented to the jury, nor was there any
    found by the sheriff's office after countless searches The
    judge's phantasms were shared by all of Kern County; indeed,
    it seemed that the whole community had plunged into a
    collective nightmare.  By the beginning of 1985, four
    sex-ring trials clogged the Kern County courthouse, and a
    total of eight had been uncovered in an area containing about
    130,000 people.  [Nathan and Snedeker,
    p.98]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The ideological preconditions must have existed in many
  places.  But in a few places where initial accusations were
  developed, they spread quickly to encompass many additional
  prosecutions.  The same phenomena which occurred in Kern and
  Manhattan Beach in 1983-5 occurred again over the next few
  years in Wenatchee, Washington; in Lowell, Massachusetts; under
  the inspired fanaticism of eventual Attorney General Janet
  Reno, in Dade Country, Florida; and in a handful of other
  places.  The image of a forest in a drought springs to mind.
  Anywhere throughout the forest could burst into wildfire at any
  time, but that crucial spark only happens to occur in a subset
  of the places.  Such was the USA in 1984.</p>
		
		
			<h3>Obtaining Outsidelessness</h3>
			<p>The ideology of ritual abuse is more sophisticated in its
  internal structure than a simple dismissal as 'hysteria' or a
  'witch hunt' might lead one to think.<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
					<p>Of course, other social 'hysterias', and other witch
    hunts (literal and figurative), have often had their own
    associated ontologies and deductive systems.  It is not the
    case, for example, that European witch hunts over decades or
    centuries were simple unstructured fears which overcame
    otherwise sensible people.  That movement also had its own
    internal logic, its own "philosophers" and ideologues, its
    metaphysical reasonings, and so on.  People believed in
    witches, and in satanic possession and the like, for reasons
    that played into a variety of social reasonings, and fit
    moderately systematically with other belief schemes.  I take
    no position, just for lack of sufficient study, on whether,
    or in what respect, older witch-hunts participate in the
    trends of totalization and amnesic non-refutation which are
    my concerns in this particular discussion.</p>
				</small></td></tr></table>

  The ideologues of ritual abuse rely on many true and cogent
  observations.  They carry through deductive reasonings.  They
  integrate other areas of thought and knowledge.  For example,
  one common premise of ritual abuse ideology almost seems to be
  a Freudian truism,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The daughter's lie, cautioned Summit,
    "carries more credibility than the most explicit claims of
    incestuous entrapment.  It confirms adult expectations that
    children cannot be trusted.  It restores the precarious
    equilibrium of the family.  Children learn not to complain.
    Adults learn not to listen.  The authorities learn not to
    believe.  [Nathan and Snedeker, p.222, quoting Roland C.
    Summit, "The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome,"
    Child Abuse and Neglect, 7(1983)]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Psychic repression, at some level, is an undeniable
  property of human thinking.  When used by the ritual abuse
  ideologists, like Summit, it forms the linchpin of a mechanism
  of justification.  It is an argument to trump all
  non-totalizing ones which might be counterposed to it, and in
  that creates precisely the kind of outsidelessness which I
  discuss in this dissertation.</p>
			<p>The totalizing quality of ritual abuse ideology's
  repression explanation lies in its ability preemptively to
  coopt the very argument which most immediately refute its
  claims.  The "abused child" is firstly granted a privileged
  epistemic status, in an echo of Hegel's master/slave dialectic
  or of much feminist standpoint theory, which grants special
  knowledge to the oppressed.  But then a special hermeneutic is
  introduced to truly understand the meaning of the "abused
  child's" testimony and this interpretive principle performs the
  foreclosure.  Another prominent ritual abuse ideologist
  describes the "unfolding" of truth in children's
  testimony,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In May 1984, Kee MacFarlane told Congress:
    "What we capture on videotape on the first interview is an
    incredible kind of spontaneity, this eye- opening reality
    that comes from children's first descriptions of abuse."
    [Nathan and Snedeker, 1996, p.224, quoting Kee MacFarlane,
    "Child Sexual Victims in the Courts," Hearings Before the
    Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice of the Committee on the
    Judiciary of the United States Senate, May 2,22, 1984,
    p.88]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Of course, MacFarlane's "spontaneity" is still one
  mediated by the enclosing principle of an outsideless ideology
  since,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[I]nstead of revealing heartfelt narratives
    by children, the recording starred the interviewers [such as
    MacFarlane] themselves, and showed them working strenuously
    to lead children from denials to "yes" answers.  The same
    tapes were instrumental in producing jury verdicts favorable
    to [defendants].  [Nathan and Snedeker, p.224, notes
    added]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>As mentioned, an outsideless ideology is not merely
  spontaneous, as the term 'mass hysteria' might be read.
  Totalization cannot function without a certain sort of
  spontaneity, inasmuch as a large number of people must be in
  some way predisposed to participate in an enclosing reasoning.
  I have discussed some such motives.  But at the same time,
  spontaneity also requires a lot of leg-work for the
  ideologists.  </p>
			<p>Much of the work in establishing the right interpretive
  framework, the hermeneutics, of ritual abuse ideology, is
  getting the right social system of official expertise in place
  (as with most ideologies).  In this, the ideologists quickly
  realized that videotape could not be relied on to provide an
  adequate hermeneutic, and interpretation must be left to
  experts best able to understand the meaning of children's
  spontaneous testimony (which generally takes the form of denial
  of the events proposed by prosecutorial staff, even after
  moderate coercion).  By 1985, </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>[A]ttendees learned at the FBI's 1985
    ritual-abuse conference, abandoning their tape recorders and
    notepads "worked" for prosecutors.  [Nathan and Snedeker,
    p.226].</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Such a hermeneutic was given even more explicit
  imprimatur within a few more years,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Child-protection authorities
    institutionalized their phobias about interview records in
    1987, when the National Center for the Prosecution of Child
    Abuse (NCPCA) published a voluminous manual instructing
    district attorneys on how to handle child abuse cases.
    Titled Investigation and Prosecution of Child Abuse [it]
    contains reams of advice on how to gather pro-prosecution
    expert witnesses perhaps most important on not videotaping
    interview with children, since doing so may help the defense.
    [Nathan and Snedeker, p.226]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Once the ideological leg-work is done, most people are
  pretty inclined to believe what "all the experts" say about a
  matter, especially if not to believe is to be cast in the same
  boat with child-molesters and the like.  And even more
  especially if the right internal mechanisms exist to
  incorporate apparent refutation into the conceptual scheme of
  ritual abuse ideology.</p>
		
		
			<h3>Remembrance of Ideologies Past</h3>
			<p>What happens when totalization is a thing of the past?
  The actual positivistic step of refuting the old ideas is the
  rarest of beasts.  But for almost everyone who remembers an old
  ideology, it is de rigueur to experience a homologue of
  refutation.  I believe that it is in the nature of life within
  ideology (not to say there is another kind, of course), to
  require the structure of belief which positivism endorses in a
  general way.  Perhaps not the whole progressivist structure we
  have experienced for a few hundred years of rigorous science
  and Capitalism, but at the very least a structure of
  experiencing the past in terms of overcoming; Benjamin's
  undoubtably more accurate Angel of History, who sees only the
  accumulation of horrors while being blown backwards, is not the
  Angel of Ideology.  Nathan and Snedeker give an
  illustration,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The older reporters always passionately
    recount how, while everyone else at their newspaper or TV
    station ten years ago thought Kelly Michaels or the McMartin
    teachers were guilty, they saw the whole thing as a witch
    hunt (even though they filed no stories to that effect and
    did not argue the point with their colleagues).  [Nathan and
    Snedeker, 1996, p.  245]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The truth is, I do not know what happened to ritual abuse
  ideology.  It seems to be gone now, and I think probably no
  more waves of mass prosecutions of supposed Satanists will
  occur in the next few years.  In some manner, the preconditions
  which congealed by 1983 have dissipated by 1995.  The eventual
  acquittals of a some defendants has (mostly on appeal,
  therefore outside the immediate communities) probably had a
  certain effect.  Kiddie porn and incest have faded from media
  focus although those fadings are no more obvious causally.  But
  far more than these "refutational" aspects come into play, an
  ideological forgetfulness has come over us.  The ideological
  alliances which shaped ritual abuse ideology have moved into
  new formations (for example, anti-welfare ideology grabs a
  similar range of elements).  Attentions have shifted to new
  fantasies and new anxieties.  Totalities follow fashions, hems
  rise or fall, a new band or movie is all-the-rage, and it is
  hard to imagine the appeal of what we recently believed with
  what was in us more than we were in ourselves.<b><sup>[note]</sup></b><table border="1" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#FFFFEE" width="35%" align="right"><tr><td><small>
