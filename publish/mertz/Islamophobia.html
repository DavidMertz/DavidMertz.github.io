<H2 CLASS="western">Islamophobia and the secularism of fools</H2>
<P>by <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/LuluLotus">David Mertz</A> on
Tuesday, September 27, 2011 at 12:00am</P>
<P>It is disturbing to see many English-speaking &quot;professional
atheists&quot; use their sensible stance against religious belief as
a pretext for a truly ugly and ignorant Islamophobia.&nbsp; Sam
Harris is certainly a prominent example in this regard, and
Christopher Hitchens little less so.&nbsp; Filtering down from these
prominent writers of books preaching against religion, I have seen
with unfortunate frequency the same bigotry echoed by some &quot;amateur
atheists&quot; of my personal acquaintance.</P>
<P>All of these &quot;secular&quot; Islamophobes--to a person--come
from predominantly Christian countries, and the large majority of
them are not far removed from Christianity in their own familial
histories, either rejecting the religious belief systems of their own
parents (and often their own younger selves), or possibly at a step
further removed to the grandparents with whom they have a certain
cultural identification.&nbsp; This particular prejudice is most
certainly an obvious product of <EM>Christendom</EM>, even where it
does not reflect actual <EM>Christianity</EM>.&nbsp; Beyond the
broader historical context, it is also clear that these &quot;thinkers&quot;
are largely just boosterists for US neo-colonial policy in
predominantly Muslim countries, with just the thinnest veneer of
&quot;skepticism about religion&quot; propping up or rationalizing
these political agenda.</P>
<P>As a first brush, religion is obviously indeed bad and wrong.&nbsp;
I'm with them at the sort of surface philosophy level in that there
aren't any gods, spirits, souls, whatever, but for me it is sort of a
fairly indifferent matter... I'm an atheist in the much same way that
I'm a heliocentrist.&nbsp; It is difficult for me not to see the
<EM>professional atheists</EM> as suffering a bit in the &quot;protesteth
too much&quot; direction.&nbsp; Their demons are not mine, and mostly
they seem to misunderstand directions of causality.&nbsp; Marx, as
always, understood matters much more subtly, e.g.:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Religious distress is at the same time the
expression of real distress and the protest against real distress.
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a
heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation.
It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the
illusory happiness of the people is required for their real
happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is
the demand to give up a condition which needs illusions.&quot; -Karl
Marx, Critique of Hegelâ€™s Philosophy of Right</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The modern professionals repeat Feuerbach's inversion--150 years
after the greater philosopher made his mistake--and see causes where
only effects are present.</P>
<P>These recent atheist authors seem to have unconsciously absorbed a
worldview of &quot;Christendom&quot;, even while demurely denouncing
that religion along with others.&nbsp; And specifically, they have
bought into this a dangerous bigotry that a few acts of violence by a
few Muslims in the last decade or two show something intrinsic to the
religious doctrine... never mind that the vast majority of Muslims do
not share these political views, that those who act this way also
come from a small sliver of the Islamic world in terms of ethnicity,
nation, denomination/tendency, etc. More specifically, they seem
unable to see--or perhaps simply to care about--the specific
socio-historical conditions that have given rise to a
specific--albeit deeply misguided--ideology of resistance to Western
hegemony.&nbsp; Perhaps the most fundamental mistake they make is in
fantasizing that a few people (but only if they happen to be Muslim)
who do actually horrible things do so <EM>because</EM> of their
religious belief rather than using that doctrine as a cheap pretext
to rationalize or justify something that is far more historically
specific than a doctrine that has proven quite flexible over 1500
years.&nbsp; Rarely have the empires of this religion been especially
violent in the context the many wars and conquests the world has seen
in that period--not to say Muslims have been very often pacifistic,
but what they have done in terms of violence pales compared to, say,
the Christian Crusaders and Inquisitors, or the rather secular
Mongols and Nazis, or for that matter that nascently secular
sentiment of the only nominally Muslim Ottoman genocide in Armenia.</P>
<P>Moreover, these authors and advocates seem completely unable to
recognize the enormous atrocities performed (both in the last decades
and before) by self-proclaimed Christians, Hindus, Jews, and even by
Buddhists.&nbsp; To these misguided &quot;secularists&quot; the few
bad acts of some Muslims cast a sort of &quot;blood libel&quot;
against all the believers in Islam generally.&nbsp; If a US general,
in 2004, proclaims that it is his &quot;Christian mission&quot; to
terror bomb Fallujah--and kill thousands of civilians--these
advocates assume that religious justification is incidental and
unimportant, while if Muslims mention religion in commission of far
less brutal acts, a collective guilt, in their minds, falls upon all
followers of that religion.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Obviously, I think the doctrines of Islam are <EM>wrong</EM>.&nbsp;
But they are wrong in the same sort of plain ontological and ethical
way that Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and the rest are. It
believes in a non-existent God and claims to find sustainable ethical
principles in that false belief.&nbsp;</P>
<P>As a matter of actual doctrine, I tend to find Judaism probably
the worst of the batch, since others are not inherently exclusionary
(with the exception of Zoroastrianism, I suppose, and perhaps the
Druze)--they don't preach that God has a genetic preference for a
certain subset of humanity, and smites all the rest (or at least has
a distaste for them on a racial/ethnic basis... well, Mormonism had
some of this, but eventually gave it up).&nbsp; The others just want
people to <EM>convert</EM> to belief in their &quot;true God.&quot;&nbsp;
But as much as I dislike the <EM>religion</EM>, I would equally
little think that such doctrinal disagreement warranted
antisemitism.&nbsp; Moreover, someone like Harris or Hitchens would
say roughly the same thing about Judaism while holding this vile
bigotry towards Islam.</P>
<P>It's a damn shame these modern secularists haven't read, or have
so thoroughly forgotten, their smarter predecessors, such as August
Bebel (to whom my paraphrased saying is generally attributed) or even
just to Marx in &quot;The Jewish Question&quot; (hell, even Sartre,
whom I mostly disdain, at least got this much right).</P>
