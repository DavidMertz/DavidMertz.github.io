  Obviously, it has been very disturbing to me to see so many
  folks on this list discovering long-discredited fantasies about
  CIA/Bush/etc planning of the September 11 attacks (e.g. the
  various Pentagon stories are several years old; conspiracy fans
  can always spin new variants, of course, so something is always
  trivially novel).
</p>
<p>
  Part of my distress is just the matter that this is time and
  mental effort wasted; and also that it tends to discredit
  actual leftist analyses when the same people and groups engage
  in weird fantasies rather than analysis.  I know you're
  supposed to refuse ad hominem arguments--maybe nut cases are
  right about other things.  But still, it hardly helps when
  critiquing, say, real-life US involvement in the Haitian coup,
  to have the very same people spouting Area 51-style stuff in
  their next breath.
</p>
<p>
  Another part of what bothers me personally is this peculiar,
  but characteristic, use of pseudo-science as bolster for the
  various silly arguments.  The scientistic discourse (always
  coming from non-scientists who don't begin to understand the
  stuff) is a kind of ideological mask for the fantasy.  More
  than that, however, I think that somehow the scientistic words
  must serve some kind of internal, psychological role, in the
  identificatory mechanisms of the conspiracy enthusiasts.  For
  example, we get here on this list (and elsewhere) various
  pontification about the melting points of metals, the potential
  energy in fuels, the stress fatigue of concrete and steel, and
  so on.  The fact google rapidly refutes an individual claim
  just means that that claim had not been considered with
  sufficient precision and specificity.
</p>
<p>
  Somehow an evocation of the right necromancy around these magic
  engineering concepts proves...  I don't know what, it's always
  a little murky what it's actually supposed to show.  But the
  underlying point is that things aren't really as we have "been
  told," some nefarious forces are deceiving us about very many
  things, and through great cleverness and attention to "these
  certain facts" we can see through the plots.  For
  nominal-leftists, I guess it means the CIA planted bombs in the
  WTC and Pentagon rather than planes crashing into them; for
  those of a different (e.g.  Globalcirclenet) sort, I guess it
  means Israel had something to do with it, and "all the Jews"
  were told not to show up at the WTC.  Whatever, there is
  <strong>surely</strong> something hidden than needs to be discerned.
</p>
<p>
  For fans of <cite>South Park</cite>, I guess it's always worth mentioning
  Johnny Cochran's "Chewbacca Defense" featured on the <cite>Chef Aid</cite>
  episode.
</p>
<p>
  Along these lines, in a way, I watched an enormously
  interesting film two nights ago.  Errol Morris is the wonderful
  documentarian (and erstwhile philosophy Ph.D. candidate) who
  directed such brilliant films as <cite>Thin Blue Line</cite> and <cite>Fog of
  War</cite>.  He also did one called <cite>Mr. Death</cite>.  This latter is the
  story of Fred Leuchter, an oddly fascinating--though
  disturbing--character.
</p>
<p>
  Leuchter's first career was in building execution machinery,
  first electric chairs, then lethal injection machines and gas
  chambers.  There was something ethereal about Leuchter's
  detached, mechanical characterization of the requirements for
  ending human life.  At the same time, Leuchter was a bit like
  his forerunners Dr. Guillotine and Dr. Antoine Louis (who first
  constructed it):  he favors capital punishment, but thinks it
  should be carried out "humanely."  Electric chairs are good,
  but only if they meet the qualifications of instrumental
  rationality.
</p>
<p>
  After some moderate success in creating the machinery of death,
  Leuchter was recruited for the trial of German-Canadian
  holocaust denier Ernst Zuendel.  Leuchter went off to Auschwitz
  (I think Treblinka too), and kinda haphazardly collected bits
  of brick and stone in ruins in the general vicinity of the
  former death camps.  Then he sent the stone off to a lab to
  check for the presence of cyanide-and found none.  Leuchter's
  "reasoning" was that if the buildings had been used for
  gassing, there would be trace cyanide in the walls.  The upshot
  of this pseudo-scientific endeavor was the infamous <cite>Leuchter
  Report</cite>.  The thing is that the analysis has a sort of surface
  similarity to science:  you get to talk about chemical decay
  products, parts per million, gas permeation, and so on.  The
  scientistic language provides a kind of identificatory "cover"
  for the (foregone) conclusion.
</p>
<p>
  I think for Leuchter there was also another mechanism of
  identification with narrow instrumental reason.  In the
  interviews, it was striking that Leuchter felt that <strong>if</strong> your
  goal was to kill millions of people, the <strong>best</strong> way to do it
  would be such-and-such.  He even remarks (roughly), "If you
  wanted to design gas chambers to kill thousands, no one would
  do a better job with the design than I (Leuchter)."  Now I must
  confess that I myself have a certain excess of instrumentalism
  in my brain--I actually thought momentarily about the
  <strong>technical</strong> disadvantages of Leuchter's various alternative
  methods of shooting, burying, blowing-up, etc.  In any case, it
  seems like Leuchter's conclusion was, in part, based
  (unconsciously) on his different ideas about death camps as a
  DESIGN PROBLEM.
</p>
<p>
  What's perhaps most disturbing is that I think Leuchter
  actually <strong>is not</strong> an anti-semite.  I don't think he even went
  to Poland wanting a specific result.  He's someone who "doesn't
  see the forest for the trees"... somehow drawn in by an
  apparent rationality of his own too-clever-by-half
  "experimental" design, he became ego-attached to its results.
  Enough attached that he vociferously defended the conclusion,
  to the point of touring the "neo-Nazi lecture circuit" (where
  he could receive adoring praise of his "brilliant" scientific
  analysis).
</p>
<p>
  This mode of thought would be merely pathetic if it were not
  (externally) so profoundly evil!
</p>
<p>
  Mutatis mutandis.
