</p>

<p>Everyone knows HIV is the cause of AIDS, &quot;except maybe two people&quot;, says Dr 

Robert Gallo, the American government scientist who 10 years ago skilfully 

marketed HIV to the world. There is no debate, he says. &quot;Call 5,000 scientists and 

ask.&quot; </p>

<p>Most doctors, nurses, health educationists and others on the AIDS front line 

concur. They are given to understand by the general scientific community that even 

to doubt HIV shows mental and moral deficiency. Scientists, too, have to be 

careful not to rock the HIV boat, which carries jobs, reputations and huge research 

funds. </p>

<p>Despite this pressure, a large and growing network of highly-qualified &quot;dissidents&quot; 

has become established worldwide over the past two years. They not only 

challenge the HIV hypothesis, but have &quot;come out&quot; publicly about their concerns. 

More than 450 have put their names to a letter demanding a reappraisal of the 

conventional view, arguing that the HIV hypothesis is at best unproven, at worst 

discredited. </p>

<p>The group contains more than 70 PhDs, scores of medical doctors and numerous 

other health workers and scientists, along with AIDS patients, activists and others 

who have been working for years with those most affected by the epidemic. Most 

of the names are American-based, but overall the list spans 23 countries. </p>

<p>It is the tip of an iceberg of dissent. The group's newsletter has a mailing list of 

more than 2,000. A debate over AIDS causation is breaking out around the world, 

reflected in a wave of conferences highlighting alternative ways of thinking about 

the disease. The latest of these takes place in Bologna, Italy, this month. </p>

<p>The challenge has its origins in theoretical considerations first set out in detail by 

Professor Peter Duesberg, an eminent American virologist. But it has drawn 

strength from the failure of AIDS researchers, after 10 years' work on HIV, to 

show how the virus could be doing the damage attributed to it. Gallo claimed to 

have shown it made its victims vulnerable to infections by directly killing cells of 

their immune system. It is now known he was wrong. </p>

<p>A further blow to orthodoxy has been the failure to show any lasting benefit from 

expensive but highly toxic and potentially lethal anti-HIV drugs. </p>

<p>A third concern is that the link between HIV and AIDS is much less close than had 

been thought. HIV is not the &quot;death sentence&quot; many were given to understand. The 

collapse of doomsday predictions about HIV's spread (3m UK HIV-positives by 

1990, according to a 1985 forecast; actual 10-year cumulative total to date: 21,000) 

has become apparent in most countries with careful testing programmes. </p>

<p>The HIV test itself is discredited. There has been no reasoned response to scientists 

who argue it was never properly validated, and that false positives are the rule not 

the exception. A crisis looms, probably the biggest faced by the modern scientific 

community. </p>

<p>All the more reprehensible, then, in a discipline dedicated to openness, that most 

doctors and scientists are unfamiliar with the dissidents' detailed arguments because 

leading scientific and medical journals refuse to publish them. </p>

<p>Despite the issue's importance, journal editors and advisers seem to reason, like 

Gallo, that since &quot;everyone&quot; agrees HIV is the cause of AIDS, anyone seriously 

proposing otherwise is eccentric and illogical. Dissidents are dangerous, it is argued, 

because if people doubt HIV's role in AIDS, they might not heed warnings about 

the need to change sexual habits. </p>

<p>John Maddox, editor of Nature, the science journal, feels so strongly on the issue 

that he has been trying to dissuade this newspaper from reporting evidence that the 

virus is probably not the cause of AIDS, and that AIDS may not be an epidemic 

putting everyone at risk. </p>

<p>Other publications, lay and professional, follow a similar line. New Scientist 

magazine, under the headline &quot;HIV: beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, declared that 

despite &quot;a mountain of scientific evidence&quot; showing that HIV does cause AIDS, &quot;a 

small number of journalists and dissident scientists continue to question the link&quot;. 

That &quot;mountain&quot; of evidence never existed; the HIV consensus is crumbling. 

Maddox admits that the failure to find a mechanism for how HIV causes the 

disease has been &quot;a profound disappointment to the research community&quot;, and that 

the only evidence implicating the virus an epidemiological association between 

testing HIV-positive and being diagnosed as having AIDS &quot;necessarily seems 

circumstantial&quot;. </p>

<p>Signatories of the reappraisal letter are united in wanting a change in direction; they 

differ in the extent to which they reject the HIV theory. </p>

<p>Some, like Dr Charles Thomas, a molecular biologist and former Harvard professor 

of biochemistry, say it is complete nonsense. &quot;The HIV-causes-AIDS dogma 

represents the grandest and perhaps the most morally destructive fraud that has 

ever been perpetrated on the young men and women of the Western world,&quot; he 

says. </p>

<p>Equally outspoken is Phillip Johnson, senior professor of law, University of 

California at Berkeley, and a former visiting professor at University College 

London. </p>

<p>&quot;One does not need to be a scientific specialist to recognise a botched research job 

and a scientific establishment that is distorting the facts to promote an ideology and 

maximise its funding,&quot; he says. &quot;That establishment continues to doctor statistics 

and misrepresent the situation to keep the public convinced that a major viral 

pandemic is under way when the facts are otherwise.&quot; </p>

<p>Others, like Dr Lawrence Bradford, a biology professor in Atchison, Kansas, and 

Dr Roger Cunningham, a microbiologist and director of the centre for immunology 

at the State University of New York at Buffalo, think the virus could be one factor 

among many, but maintain an unbiased reassessment is urgently needed. </p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Cunningham says, &quot;an AIDS 'establishment' seems to have 

formed that intends to discourage challenges to the dogma on one side and often 

insists on following discredited ideas on the other.&quot; </p>

<p>Bradford lists drug use, multiple infections, exposure to blood products, rectal 

exposure to semen, and autoimmune phenomena in which the immune system 

becomes so confused that it starts to self-destruct as among interacting events that 

may lead up to AIDS. </p>

<p>Many other signatories hold a similar view. Professor Arthur Gottlieb, head of 

microbiology and immunology at Tulane University medical school, New Orleans, 

believes HIV can disrupt the immune system, but lists several co-factors, including 

malnutrition, as important. </p>

<p>Dr Steven Jonas, professor of preventive medicine, State University of New York 

at Stony Brook, says evidence is now &quot;rapidly accumulating&quot; that the original 

theory of HIV as the sole cause of AIDS is not correct. He thinks it plays a part in 

most cases, but &quot;by itself it is not sufficient to cause the disease&quot;. </p>

<p>Dr Alfred Hassig, former professor of immunology at the University of Bern and 

director of a Swiss blood transfusion laboratory, says multiple stresses on the 

immune system provoke an acute reaction, allowing latent microbes, including HIV, 

to proliferate. He believes dietary measures can reverse this process, and urges that 

&quot;the sentences of death now accompanying the medical diagnosis of AIDS should 

be abolished&quot;. </p>

<p>Dr Gordon Stewart, professor emeritus of public health, Glasgow University, and a 

former World Health Organisation AIDS adviser, who links AIDS in Western 

countries to behaviours carrying high risks of genital and other infections, points out 

that the implication of such alternative views is that existing efforts to fight AIDS 

are &quot;very wasteful of effort and expenditure&quot;. </p>

<p>Most of the signatories, such as Dr Henk Loman, professor of biophysical 

chemistry at the Free University in Amsterdam, deplore the neglect of non-HIV 

lines of research. &quot;There are many people with AIDS but without HIV, and a great 

many people with HIV but without AIDS,&quot; says Loman. &quot;These two facts mean 

that HIV AIDS is much too simple. Plausible, alternative, testable causes of 

impairment of the immune system which may ultimately lead to AIDS should 

become part of regular AIDS research.&quot; </p>

<p>Many of the scientists believe the fight against AIDS was derailed by a flaw in 

reasoning over HIV in which &quot;the hypothesis itself got incorporated in the definition 

of AIDS,&quot; as Dr Kary Mullis, winner of last year's Nobel prize for chemistry, puts 

it. When people fall sick and HIV is present or thought to be present, it is called 

AIDS; when HIV is not present, it is called something else. </p>

<p>Mullis, who invented a genetic test used worldwide by AIDS researchers, says that 

&quot;the HIV theory, the way it is being applied, is unfalsifiable and therefore useless as 

a medical hypothesis&quot;. He believes AIDS arose through &quot;an enormous level of 

exposure to human viruses and bacteria&quot;. </p>

<p>Robert Maver, consulting actuary to healthcare and insurance industries, and 

former vice-president and director of research with the giant Mutual Benefit Life 

Insurance Co, agrees that incorporating HIV into the definition of AIDS &quot;has 

created a high correlation that is tautologically contrived&quot;. </p>

<p>Harry Rubin, professor of molecular and cell biology, University of California at 

Berkeley, declares himself &quot;an HIV agnostic. It is not proven that AIDS is caused 

by HIV infection, nor is it proven that it plays no role whatever in the syndrome.&quot; </p>

<p>An Italian signatory, Dr Fabio Franchi, a specialist in preventive medicine and 

infectious diseases in Trieste, declares: &quot;I am not agnostic; I am well convinced, 

above all by the arguments of Professor Peter Duesberg.&quot; Duesberg, professor of 

molecular biology at the University of California at Berkeley, and a founder of the 

reappraisal group, says HIV is harmless, and believes long-term misuse of both 

recreational and medical drugs is the prime cause of AIDS. </p>

<p>Equally sure of HIV's innocence is Dr Bernard Forscher, formerly managing editor 

of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. &quot;The HIV hypothesis 

ranks with the 'bad air' theory for malaria and the 'bacterial infection' theory for 

beriberi and pellagra (caused by nutritional deficiencies),&quot; he says. &quot;It is a hoax that 

became a scam.&quot; </p>

<p>Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology, University of California at Berkeley, 

who interviewed Duesberg after becoming &quot;intrigued by the highly emotional 

reactions&quot; to his ideas, found there were no convincing answers to his questions. 

&quot;In particular I have pursued the situation of haemophiliacs and HIV because it was 

the arena least charged with moralism. Systematic attempts to be allowed to look at 

the data or to find rigorous controlled studies have failed.&quot; </p>

<p>Another Berkeley scientist, Dr Richard Strohman, emeritus professor of molecular 

and cell biology, is concerned that &quot;while it becomes increasingly clear that factors 

other than HIV must be involved in AIDS, the major research effort continues to 

focus on the virus&quot;. </p>

<p>Harvey Bialy, research editor of the New York-based journal BioTechnology, who 

has a background in molecular biology and tropical disease study in West Africa, 

insists that &quot;AIDS&quot; in Africa can mostly be attributed to economic decline, decline 

in health care and development of drug-resistant infections. &quot;All these things can 

explain exactly what is going on, to much greater good for the public health than 

saying the diseases are being made worse by HIV,&quot; he says. </p>

<p>Several signatories say that apart from misdirecting energies, the HIV theory has 

caused great psychological damage. Paul Lineback, counselling psychologist, 

Eastern Oregon State College, says: &quot;Protecting and promoting the unproven HIV 

hypothesis as fact is inducing unnecessary stress, probably emotional harm, and 

maybe even psychological murder.&quot; </p>

<p>Michael Ellner, president of Heal (Health Education AIDS Liaison), based in New 

York City, a medical hypnotherapist who has worked with thousands of people 

with AIDS-related fears and conditions, says: &quot;I have seen the constant terror, and 

programming to get sick and die, that people at risk for developing AIDS face. I am 

certain that the hypothesis that long-term drug use is a primary cause of what is 

now called AIDS is far more likely to prove true than the failed notion that AIDS is 

caused by a germ.&quot; </p>

<p>According to David Mertz, a philosopher of science at the University of 

Massachusetts, Amherst, HIV is an &quot;entity of convenience&quot; that met the needs of 

powerful groups: researchers competing for personal and national prestige after the 

failure of the United States government's &quot;war on cancer&quot;; gay civil rights 

campaigners &quot;who wanted to remake AIDS as an 'equal opportunity killer',&quot; and 

the right wing, &quot;who wanted an agent to concretise the 'wrath of God' that they 

fantasised as visited upon gays&quot;. </p>

<p>If Mertz is right, will the illusion ever end? </p>

<p>Professor Hiram Caton, head of the school of applied ethics at Griffith University, 

Brisbane, Australia, believes it will. The orthodox view will collapse, he says, 

&quot;because it flunks the practical tests. No vaccine will be forthcoming. No effective 

treatment will appear. The hype will exhaust its credibility. </p>

<p>&quot;Scientists will then have to come to terms with the awful fact that the AIDS 

epidemic was a mirage manufactured by scientists who believed that integrity could 

be maintained amidst the diverting influences of big money, prestige and politics.&quot; *<br>
