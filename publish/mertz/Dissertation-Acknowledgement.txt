ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As is usual, I would like to thank my friends, family and
lovers—those during the course of writing this, before I started,
and those I will have subsequently—who no doubt shaped much of
what went into this.  I would like to thank my director, and all
those other professors and teachers I have had, who in some
combination added to and subtracted from my knowledge and the
clarity of my thinking.  Naturally, I could not have done this
without the authors of the books and articles I have read, both
the good ones and the bad ones.

A special negative debt is owed to the Graduate School of the
University of Massachusetts, whose foolish typographic
regulations make the document you hold before you worse than it
should be in minor but annoying ways.  Should anyone wish to read
this document, a better version should be available at
<http://gnosis.cx/publish/mertz>.

And just in case the document does not make it evident, I thank
Karl Marx...  for all things.
