<h1 id="conversion-to-emeritus-psf-membership">Conversion to Emeritus
PSF Membership</h1>
<p>Whereas a ballot measure currently being voted will most likely pass,
and will make removal of Fellows trivially easy; and whereas several
white, male, cishet, high-income, developed world, members of the Code
of Conduct Working Group have expressed open and direct hostility to me,
my opposition to ballot measure 3, to any open discussion of best
governance procedures of the PSF; and whereas many of these same people
have directly shut down meaningful discussion of governance issue on
discuss.python.org, and on various Python mailing lists, I wish to
convert my PSF Fellowship to Emeritus status, effective immediately
(before I am actually kicked out for polite expression of dissenting
opinions.</p>
<p>This request in no way reflects any intention to become less involved
in the Python community. I fully intend to continue to write books and
articles about Python. To give keynote and technical talks to Python
conferences around the worldâ€”many specifically promoting diversity and
inclusion. To promote the Python programming language among progressive
and labor organizations. To perform training in scientific and numeric
Python, and in data science/machine learning Python tools. To contribute
to open source projects in the Python ecosystem. And especially to
promote equality, fairness, and social justice in Python and other
communities.</p>
<p>I simply believe that that honor that was formerly attached to
becoming a Fellow of the Foundation has been stripped of good will or
honor by those intent on exercise of arbitrary self-aggrandizement and
grandstanding.</p>
<p>Such is not an appropriate role for me to participate in or
endorse.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
